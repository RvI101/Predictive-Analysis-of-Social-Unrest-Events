Supreme Court holds man unfit for police job|NEW DELHI|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Supreme Court agreed with the Madhya Pradesh police that a man acquitted on “benefit of doubt” for impersonating a police officer to commit robbery and receive stolen property is not fit to join the force as a constable. A Supreme Court Bench of Justices Arun Mishra and Navin Sinha held that the man, Bunty, had no business being in the police. His acquittal had been on technical grounds. He was involved in a crime of moral turpitude and the acquittal did not clearly lift the clouds over his antecedents. “The perception formed by the Screening Committee that he was unfit to be inducted in the disciplined police force was appropriate… decision of Scrutiny Committee does not warrant judicial interference,” the Supreme Court said in a recent judgment. The State had come in appeal against a decision of the Madhya Pradesh High Court Division Bench, which set aside the screening committee’s call to reject Bunty. A single judge of the High Court had earlier upheld the committee’s stand. The court said acquittal on benefit of doubt is not really a “clean acquittal.” “If acquittal in a case involving moral turpitude or offence of heinous/serious nature, on technical ground and it is not a case of clean acquittal, or benefit of reasonable doubt has been given, the employer may consider relevant facts as to antecedents and may take appropriate decision as to the continuance of the employee,” the apex court referred to past precedents. The court pointed out that it is really up to the police force to decide whether a person who has not had an “honourable” acquittal should be inducted in the police force.

SC suspends eco clearance for international airport in Goa|NEW DELHI|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The health of the environment is key to preserving the right to life, the Supreme Court has observed in a recent judgment and suspended the environmental clearance granted for an international airport at Mopa in Goa. Upholding the need to strengthen the ‘environmental rule of law’ for both intra and inter-generational equity, a Bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and Hemant Gupta said every branch of governance and institutions across the country should strive to enforce this rule of law. While the most direct effect of a strong rule of law is protection of the environment, a firm regime against environmental exploitation would “strengthen rule of law more broadly, support sustainable economic and social development, protect public health, contribute to peace and security by avoiding and defusing conflict, and protect human and constitutional rights.” The apex court said transparency is necessary for the robust enforcement of environmental rule of law. “The rule of law requires a regime which has effective, accountable and transparent institutions,” Justice Chandrachud observed. In this case, the court said how the State of Goa, the Centre and the concessionaire highlighted the need for the new airport to accommodate the increasing volume of passengers. They had urged the court to disregard the “flaws” in the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) process. They had argued that setting up a new airport was a “matter of policy.” However, dismissing their pleas, the court said “the role of the decision-makers is to ensure that every important facet of the environment is adequately studied and that the impact of the proposed activity is carefully assessed.” “In the present case, as our analysis has indicated, there has been a failure of due process,” the court held.

About a fortnight ago, the Ministry had informed the State of its decision to pull out the 35 companies of Central forces and deploy them on election duty in other parts of West Bengal.

Gold hidden in flower vase seized at airport|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Air Intelligence Unit of Department of Customs on Sunday seized around 150 grams of gold, concealed in a flower vase, from a passenger who arrived here from Dubai. During a routine scanning of baggages of passengers, who landed here by a Spicejet flight, the Customs officials grew suspicious over the content inside the flower vase found in possession of a passenger identified as A. Stephen of Sivaganga district. However, during enquiry, the youth revealed that he was given the flower vase by someone at Dubai Airport asking him to hand it over to a friend who would collect it at the Madurai airport. “Our suspicion was strengthened and our officials broke open the vase and found gold in the form of powder inside the vase. We suspect that the passenger was not aware of the gold being concealed in the vase,” said Assistant Commissioner A. Venkadesh Babu said.

Prayers before polls|Tirunelveli|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|  Whenever she happened to pass by the Kotturpuram Vinayakar Temple in Chennai, late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s vehicle would halt for a couple of minutes in front of the shrine, and the AIADMK supremo would pray in silence for a while before leaving the spot. Her followers in Tirunelveli espouse this sentiment even now, as they would always start their election campaign only after offering prayers at Sri Eesaana Vinayakar Temple on East Car Street in Tirunelveli town. Even though AMMK leader T.T.V. Dhinakaran fielded candidates in all Lok Sabha constituencies after parting ways with the AIADMK, his party has not done away with the ‘prayer sentiment’.

‘Christian missionaries’ contribution to Tamil immense’|MADURAI|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The contribution of Christian missionaries to Tamil language and taking education to all sections of the society were immense, said P. Nedumaran, president, Tamil Desiya Iyakkam here on Sunday. Speaking at a discussion organised by St. Joseph Catholic Youth Movement, he said that education was once accessible to only those belonging to upper castes and particularly men. “It due to the Christian missionaries and the institutions run by them that education became accessible to all,” he said, adding that he himself studied in such institutions. Similarly, he pointed out the contributions made by missionaries like Veeramamunivar (Constantine Joseph Beschi) and G.U. Pope to Tamil. Apart from translating texts like Tirukkural, he said that these missionaries also helped in significantly improving the style of writing in Tamil. “Majority of the books first printed in Tamil were by the missionaries,” he said. Expressing concern over the cash for votes phenomenon, he said that people selling their votes impacted the whole society since wrong people get elected because of their choice. “However, the power to change is also with the people,” he said. Madurai Archbishop and president of Tamil Nadu Bishops’ Council Antony Pappusamy, in his inaugural address, highlighted that roughly seven crore youngsters were to vote in the upcoming elections. “If they exercise their choice rightly, we can expect a change and transformation in the society,” he said. R. Kaleeswaran from Loyola College, and John Moses from Janata Dal (Secular) also spoke.

BJP, a betrayer: Mutharasan|THANJAVUR|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|R.Mutharasan, State secretary, Communist Party of India, on Saturday charged the Bharatiya Janata Party government at the Centre with permitting the Congress government at Karnataka to prepare a detailed project report for construction of a dam across the Cauvery at Mekedatu. Addressing a rally here to solicit votes for candidates of his front, he termed the BJP as the betrayer of Tamil Nadu in several issues such as hydrocarbon, NEET and Cauvery Seeking votes for former Union Minister S.S.Palanimanickam (Thanjavur Lok Sabha constituency) and T.K.G.Neelamegam (Thanjavur Assembly constituency), he said the BJP government had stated in the Supreme Court that it would not be possible to grant exemption from NEET to Tamil Nadu. As for the hydrocarbon issue, the BJP pursued its agenda despite giving hope to the public that the project would be shelved. While State-level office-bearers of BJP were declaring that the party was against the Karnataka government’s proposal on Mekedatu issue, their leadership at the Centre had not prevented the Karnataka’s bid to block flow of the Cauvery into Tamil Nadu. “The BJP’s Tamil Nadu State leader claims that giving permission to prepare the DPR cannot be construed as permission to go ahead with the project but even political novices know that DPR is the first step for implementing a project,” he said. Explaining the reason for opposition parties terming the BJP as a fascist force, he said that in the last four and half years those raising voice against the authoritarian approach of the government at the Centre or at the State were booked under the National Security Act and other stringent laws.

Vote for ‘Mango,’ vote for development, says PMK|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|If the PMK getting the Chennai Central Lok Sabha constituency in the AIADMK-led mega alliance was a surprise, the party announcing Sam Paul, an entrepreneur, came as another surprise. Unfazed by the track record of the DMK and the Marans in the constituency, Mr. Paul began his campaign early on Sunday from Wall Tax Road in the harbour area. With a sizable north Indian population, Mr. Paul chose the development plank for his campaign.“For development, please vote for the AIADMK-BJP alliance,” he told voters.

Keep this in mind,” his spokesperson said, much to the delight of the crowds, who watched the campaign from their terraces. Asked about the campaign in Hindi, Mr. Paul said that it was because of the target audience. “I’m pro-Tamil. I’m also against forcible imposition of Hindi,” he added.

Stalin says DMK secured Cauvery water|VELLORE|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam president M.K.

Vasanthakumar was trying to block development projects intended for creating jobs for the youth. “Last time, the people made me win with a margin of over 1,28,000 votes.

Vasanthakumar was creating hurdles for making employment for the youth by vowing not to allow setting up of the transshipment terminal, despite making similar promises in the previous elecion. “There is no need for the MP post, if no development is brought here,” he said.

Further, Mr. Radhakrishnan said the Election Commission should monitor cash being distributed by his rivals.

Beginning their trail in Mylapore, Stalin Jacob, a volunteer, said all of them were united in their support for Dravidian politics, which was best represented by the DMK at present. “Over the last few years, we feel that our individual rights and freedom have been encroached upon.

Website launched Before they began the campaign, the group also launched the candidate’s official campaign website,www.ithamizhachi.comThis, they said, was a decision taken by Ms. Thangapandian as she felt it was important to focus on the youth, who were catalysts of change. “I know several youngsters who are cynical about politics and I’ve thought so myself too. But we need to look at the issues plaguing our State, right from the educational policies to women’s safety, and come together to make informed choices,” said Diana, another volunteer. Stating that he belonged to a generation that had enjoyed the benefits offered by the DMK government, Vijay Mohan, an IT professional from Perungudi, said that the party’s ideology resonated with his. “This campaign is our way of giving back to the DMK. We hope the next generation too gets to enjoy the benefits that we derived in the past during the DMK rule,” said Thanga Karthik, a researcher.

‘Stalin cannot find fault with AIADMK government’|THANJAVUR|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|AIADMK co-coordinator and Chief Minister Edappadi K.Palaniswami on Sunday said that DMK president M.K.Stalin was making “frivolous statements” during campaign, an outcome of “election trauma.” Mr. Stalin was behaving in a childish way since the State government could not be faulted on any issue, the Chief Minister said while campaigning at Kumbakonam for AIADMK candidate S.Asaithambi fielded in Mayiladuthurai Parliamentary constituency. The Chief Minister ridiculed the reported statement of Mr. Stalin challenging the Income Tax Department to conduct raids on the house of Prime Minister Narendra Modi while speaking at Hosur. “Mr. Stalin had equated me with earthworm. I accept it. The earthworm is useful to farmers. His statement implies I am a friend of farmers.

Later, he addressed the public at Kizhavasal area in Thanjavur to seek votes for N.R.

‘Blue Mountains’ beset by land issues, jobs and infrastructure crunch|UDHAGAMANDALAM|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Land resettlement issues, lack of job opportunities for locals and concerns over the available infrastructure to cater to the ever-growing tourism industry are among the pressing issues the next Nilgiris MP will have to grapple with. Encompassing six Assembly segments across four districts – three in the Nilgiris (Udhagamandalam, Coonoor and Gudalur) and one each in Erode (Bhavani Sagar), Coimbatore (Mettupalayam) and Tirupur (Avinashi), the reserved constituency has a population as diverse as the issues it faces. Repatriates from Sri Lanka of recent Indian origin live and work alongside resident Badagas – the majority population, while the district is also home to a number of recognised tribal groups, including Todas, Kotas, Irulas, Kurumbas, Kattunayakans and Paniyas. The Nilgiris district’s economy, which has long been dependent on tea, tourism and agriculture, is at a crossroads, with tea estates no longer profitable and residents, especially in the headquarters in Udhagamandalam, becoming increasingly dependent on the tourism and hospitality sector for jobs. The crisis in the tea industry and the subsequent growth of the tourism sector has resulted in a rapidly changing ecological landscape, with picturesque vistas of tea estates gradually diminishing as a result of the construction of cottages and properties to service visitors to the “blue mountains”. Urban infrastructure has been unable to keep pace with the tourist traffic, requiring immediate attention and perhaps even a rethink of the district’s tourism model. Venugopal Dharmalingam, honorary director, Nilgiri Documentation Center, said the “unique hills are at a crucial juncture” and, over the last three decades, the district has been “systematically destroyed” by global and national developments. “The local economy is in a shambles. Tea and agriculture are stagnant. The youth are unemployed or underemployed. The indigenous culture is dying fast, while the towns are suffocating and choking,” he said. Special status must be conferred on the Nilgiris to “bring the necessary planning, funding and administration to build a world-class hill station and address local issues.” The locals have long demanded the setting up of a multi-speciality hospital, with many calling for the conversion of the now-defunct Hindustan Photo Films Limited factory into a hospital and medical college. In case of medical emergencies, residents are now having to rely on healthcare facilities in Coimbatore or Kerala. Another long-standing issue is the non-settlement of claims made by people living on lands classified under Section 17 of the Gudalur Janmam Estates (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari) Act of 1969. This has led to a lack of development in these areas, populated by tens of thousands of daily-wage workers, most of whom earn a living working in tea and coffee estates in Gudalur and Pandalur. Voting patterns Former Telecom Minister and DMK candidate A. Raja, who represented the Nilgiris during 2009-14, has stated in his campaign rallies that settling the long-pending claims to land titles would be among the party’s priorities. Voting patterns have been mixed over the last 30 years, prior to which the Congress preformed strongly here. In 2014, Mr. Raja was defeated by the AIADMK’s C. Gopalakrishnan, who capitalised on the allegations against Mr. Raja in the 2G spectrum case. Past winners include the Congress’ R. Prabhu in 2004, who was elected MP from Nilgiris (when it was a general constituency) five times since 1980, and the BJP’s Master Mathan in 1998 and 1999. TMC leader S.R. Balasubramaniyan (now AIADMK Rajya Sabha MP) was elected from here in 1996. Mr. Raja is currently the most recognisable candidate. He faces competition from the AIADMK’s M. Thiyagarajan. Mr. Raja, who retains goodwill among residents for his work to get the district back on its feet following the floods in 2009, will be keen to cash in on the support the DMK usually gets from Udhagamandalam, Coonoor and Gudalur, while also focussing on issues facing voters in Bhavani Sagar, Mettupalayam and Avinashi. MNM candidate N. Rajendran and the AMMK’s M. Ramaswami are also in the fray, and have made some attention-grabbing poll promises, including enacting land reform measures and strengthening tourism infrastructure.

Myopic move, says Vijayan|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Sunday that the Congress’s decision to field Rahul Gandhi in Wayanad smacked of political myopia.

Mr. Vijayan said minority votes would not go to Mr. Gandhi.PAGE 6

Lok Sabha polls will decide destiny of the nation: Vaiko|PUDUCHERRY|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam general secretary Vaiko on Sunday said the upcoming Lok Sabha election would decide whether democracy will prevail or fascism would take centre stage in the country. Canvassing votes for Congress candidate for Lok Sabha polls V. Vaithilingam and DMK candidate K. Venketasan for Thattanchavady byelection, Mr. Vaiko said the parliamentary polls would decide the destiny of the nation. Since the Narendra Modi-led National Democratic Alliance came to power at the Centre in 2014, the secular and democratic values of the country had taken a beating. Intolerance towards minority communities and progressive thinking people had gone up after the BJP came to power at the Centre, he said. The Centre had disturbed the federal fabric of the country as it was evident in the way three BJP leaders were appointed by the Union Government. The Centre through Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi made the appointment without consulting the elected government. The conventions followed for several years in the appointment of nominated legislators were broken, he added. In his address Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy reiterated his charge against AINRC chief N. Rangasamy that he was interested only in power and was not concerned about the development of the Union Territory. The AINRC had discarded their campaign for Statehood after joining the alliance with the BJP, he said.

Telangana voter on a solo campaign for NOTA|KHAMMAM|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Amid high voltage election campaign by the political parties ahead of the April 11 Lok Sabha election, a senior citizen is hogging public attention in the town for his novel campaign drumming up support for ‘None of The Above (NOTA)’ electoral option. Taking up cudgels against the menace of ‘political defections’, a resident of Gandhi Chowk area here, M. Venkata Subba Rao has taken up a vigorous campaign at public places to popularise NOTA option as a democratic means to express dissent with “unethical politics”. The Khammam Lok Sabha constituency saw NOTA receive 4991 votes out of total valid votes of 11,78,858 in the 2014 elections. Significantly, seven independent candidates and the contestants of four political parties, including the BJP, got fewer votes than NOTA in the Khammam Assembly constituency in the Assembly elections held in December last year. NOTA polled 3513 votes in Khammam Assembly constituency and 2106 in the ST reserved Bhadrachalam Assembly constituency in the 2018 Assembly polls. A lean 60-year-old Mr. Subba Rao, has been going around the public places as part of his campaign to make NOTA popular. Clad in a white kurta-pyjama, Mr. Rao, an ardent devotee of Shirdi Sai Baba, drew wide attention from the morning walkers at the SP stadium here on Sunday morning for his placards highlighting the NOTA option.  Expressing dissent Speaking toThe Hindu, he said his campaign is intended to mobilise public support against the undesirable trend of errant politicians switching parties after being elected under the pretext of “development.” The political defections have reached alarming proportions making a mockery of democracy, he deplored, adding that NOTA was a democratic option not only to reject candidates in the electoral fray but also express protest against the “unethical politics.”   Voters’ dismayed An unusual political scenario is prevailing in the State following a string of political desertions ahead of the ensuing election, pointed out K. Srinivasa Rao, a morning walker. “Old political adversaries have turned friends sharing common dais during the electioneering, hobnobbing with each other much to the dismay of the voters,” he added. “The NOTA electoral option and the Anti-Defection Law needs to be given more teeth to curb unethical politics and save democracy,” he contended.

‘Jayalalithaa never nurtured any animosity towards me’|PUDUCHERRY|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Chief of All India N. R Congress (AINRC) and former Chief Minister N. Rangasamy on Sunday said former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa never nurtured any animosity towards him. Mr. Rangasamy was responding to Congress leaders’ statement that Ms. Jayalalithaa had termed AINRC chief a ‘traitor,’ after he refused to include AIADMK legislators in his ministry following the 2011 Assembly elections. Launching his campaign for AINRC candidate K. Narayanasamy from Kalapet, the former Chief Minister said “Ms. Jayalalitha had “only scolded me out of affection. She never nurtured any animosity towards me. When I was Congress Chief Minister, I know against whom she had ill feelings.” Ms. Jayalalithaa was upset that the alliance between AINRC and AIADMK did not continue. If the alliance had continued, the Congress would not have come to power, he said. Responding to the charge that AINRC had fielded “a rich and an inexperienced youngster,” the party founder leader said youngsters would never come into mainstream politics if politicians developed such a mindset towards new comers. “Our candidate is the owner of a medical college. If our candidate is rich, so is Congress candidate Vaithilingam,” he said. Power struggle In a scathing attack on Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy, Mr. Rangasamy said the power struggle between the Chief Minister and Lt Governor had paralysed the administration in the Union Territory. The Chief Minister in order to hide his “failures,” often tried to shift the blame on the Lt. Governor and the principal Opposition party. The Chief Minister who had held ministerial positions at the Centre was fully aware of the limitations of an elected government in the UT. Even after knowing fully well that the power rests with the Lt. Governor, the Chief Minister tried to engage in a war of words with the titular head instead of focussing on governance. Expressing confidence in the victory of the AINRC candidate, the former Chief Minister said the National Democratic Alliance would secure more than 300 seats in the Lok Sabha polls. He said it was certain that Narendra Modi would return as the Prime Minister of the country. AIADMK legislative party leader A. Anbalagan and BJP local unit president and nominated legislator V. Saminathan were present.

Kadambur Raju lashes out at Markandeyan|Kovilpatti|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Information and Publicity Minister Kadambur C. Raju asked the people to prove that Vilathikulam was an AIADMK bastion by giving a befitting reply to betrayals by former party members. Referring to G.V. Markandeyan who rebelled against the party leadership, Mr. Raju, during his campaign address, said that while members may vie for positions, they should abide by the decision of the party top brass. Citing the 2016 Assembly election, Mr. Raju said that party south district secretary S.P. Shanmuganathan and he himself were initially denied party tickets, but were given the nod around 15 days later. “Just because we were not given a ticket, we did not choose to contest independently. A real AIADMK member would not take such a stance,” he said. “I had asked for a party ticket in 1989 to contest on the 'cock' symbol, but was given a ticket only in 2011.” He said the AIADMK candidate P. Chinnappan had proved his loyalty during his earlier tenure as MLA. “After winning the 2006 Assembly election, when he was an opposition MLA, many others went for a price. But he did not, and strengthened the hands of Jayalalithaa,” he said.

CBSE Class X question paper throws students into a tizzy|CHENNAI|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Several students and parents from Chennai have expressed concern over the disparity in difficulty levels with regard to the question papers for the Class X social science board examination conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). The exam, which took place on Friday, had three different sets of question papers and students who got the second and third set said they were at a disadvantage compared to those who got the first, owing to a tough five-mark question. While students who got the first set had to identify and list the names of political parties mentioned as national or regional parties, students who got the second set were asked to write the name of one regional political party from each State with the election symbol. Students who got the third set of question papers were similarly asked to identify and list the symbols and the names of regional political parties with their States. Madhumitha, a student who got the third set, said it was unfair to expect them to name a political party and its symbol from different States. “When the set 1 question paper expected the students to only differentiate between national and regional political parties, why was it tougher for us,” she asked. Several schools from the city have written to the board, asking for moderation to be considered. Sangeetha, parent of a student who wrote the exam, pointed out that this was not just the case with the social science paper. “We noticed these differences in the mathematics and science paper too. As parents, we have appealed to the board, hoping for moderation in the evaluation,” she added. Sarada Narendranath, head of the social science department from Bhavan’s Rajaji Vidyashram, said the textbook had provided the names of some regional parties with their symbols, but it was strictly for the understanding of the students. Otherwise good “They have never been tested on this and it is unfair to expect Class X students to remember the different symbols of over 40 regional parties from across the country,” she said, adding that the paper was otherwise a comprehensive and good one. Bhama Ravi Venkatesh, head of the social science department from Sir Siva Swami Kalalaya, too said that the question was definitely tougher for students who got the second and third set. “Students are generally tested on the functions of parties or even specifically on a few national parties. There are so many regional parties across the country and allotting five marks to this is a lot,” she said.

‘BJP wants to bring in foreigners, people will judge them’|GUWAHATI|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|At 82,Tarun Gogoi,former Assam Chief Minister,continues to be the fountainhead of the Congress in the State as it seeks to reclaim the ground lost to the Bharatiya Janata Party in the 2014 Lok Sabha election and the Assembly election two years later. Mr. Gogoi, confident that the Congress will bounce back, is particularly harsh on State Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. BJP leader Ram Madhav said the Modi wave is as strong as in 2014. If there is such a wave, why did the BJP need the help of the AGP [Asom Gana Parishad] again and other smaller parties? If there is any wave, why do they need Himanta Biswa Sarma? There is not even a ripple because they have robbed people of jobs, failed to check prices of commodities. They came by promising to eject foreigners, now they want to bring in foreigners. People will judge them soon. By foreigners, do you mean the BJP’s push for the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill that it says did not affect rural voters during the panchayat poll in December? The impact is debatable. Suppose the rural voters were not bothered, does it mean we will not fight against the Bill? It is the responsibility of all conscious leaders to go to the people, explain to them about the threat from the Bill, how it will affect our culture, history, tradition and also Assamese identity. Is the Bill designed for the Bengali people, who are a sizeable chunk of voters in Assam? The Bill is designed to keep Muslims out. But it does Bengali Hindus no good too. They will be duped. Has the Congress learned to get over the issue of illegal Bangladeshis that dominates polls in Assam? We started the NRC [updating of the National Register of Citizens] to put an end to it. The BJP, by pushing the Citizenship Bill, wants the Bangladeshi issue to remain. Otherwise, it is not an issue since the Hindus in Bangladesh are living peacefully. You have said the BJP is showing signs of defeat. How do you explain that? Look at Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal and Himanta. They are accompanying every candidate for filing nomination. This is because the candidates are not confident and they have to show their support. I never did that as the CM, not even for my son [Gaurav Gogoi, MP]. It is said the promotion of your son proved costly for the Congress... This is a wrong perception. My son was a newcomer in the 2014 election. A long-time politician like him [Mr. Sarma] had no reason to fear. Fact is, he became prominent because we encouraged him, trusted him. But he is a man who cannot be trusted. A betrayer is always a betrayer. He joined the BJP not to show his commitment but to save his skin because of Saradha [chit fund scam], Louis Berger [bribery] cases. But wasn’t his joining the BJP the beginning of the fall of Congress in Assam? These things happen. Parties come to power, lose power. Himanta was with us when the BJP won seven Lok Sabha seats in 2014. The vote difference for the BJP MP in the Jalukbari Assembly segment, his seat, was more than 10,000. Where was his strategy then? His skills did not yield the BJP seats in Mizoram and Meghalaya despite spending lots of money. There is just too much hype about him. But Ram Madhav said he is vital for the BJP to do well in the northeast. This is a big joke. Ram Madhav wants to give more importance to Himanta, who was asked not to contest the parliamentary polls, than his party president. If Amit Shah, who has the responsibility of 543 Lok Sabha seats, can contest Gandhinagar, should I believe a person who has 25 north-eastern seats to manage — that too with help from coalition partners and a few Chief Ministers — has a bigger responsibility? They are using him because of his weaknesses and won’t take long to throw him out. He is under pressure to do what they want and he has no courage to have his way. Why do you think the Congress will bounce back in Assam? The misrule and fake promises of the Narendra Modi government are a factor. The trend started with the Congress doing well in the Gujarat election. Wins in Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan followed because of our politics of love as opposed to their hatred. Assam is feeling this change. We have put up better candidates who will reap the benefits of peace and development that 15 years of Congress rule has provided.  They [BJP] are using Himanta because of his weaknesses and won’t take long to throw him out

Since then he has not contested the seat, even as the BJP has retained the seat thereafter. “People want Patel to contest from Bharuch, because they believe this will help the Congress win the seat, and its positive impact will be felt on other seats in Gujarat as well,” State election in-charge Rajiv Satav said. The final call will be taken by Congress president Rahul Gandhi. The last day to file nominations in Gujarat is April 4. Congress State president Amit Chavda said Mr. Patel had been like a guide for local party workers. “Whether it is Bharuch, Gujarat, or the country, Ahmedbhaihas been a popular leader among people cutting across caste, creed and religious lines. It is but natural that the party workers want him to contest from Bharuch.”

‘Classify transgender persons as minority community’|CHENNAI|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Former Supreme Court judge Kurian Joseph on Sunday said that the transgender community should be classified as a minority community and provided all benefits that go with it. He was speaking at a function to launchTranscender, a documentary on India’s first transgender police officer Prithika Yashini at an event organised by the Don Bosco Institute of Communication Arts (DBICA) here. He said it would be wrong to classify them as a backward community (BC) that is based on caste and community. Role of media N. Ram, Chairman, The Hindu Group of Publications, expressed concern over certain provisions in the new Bill for transgender persons. Mr. Ram said the requirement for a medical certification after sex reassignment surgery went against the right of self-identification. He said the Bill did not address issues of the community relating to employment. He underlined the role of the media in making a difference to the lives of the transgender community. Ms. Prithika Yashini said that the 30-minute-long film, directed by Fr. Ernest Pathi, made her understand the difficulties faced by actors. She said she properly utilised the opportunity she received and became a police officer. Scholarships were presented to transgender persons pursuing higher education.

Maoists call for bandh in Vizag Agency on April 5|VISAKHAPATNAM|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The banned CPI (Maoist) has called for a bandh on April 5 in the Visakha Agency in protest against the alleged killing of two tribal farmers by the anti-Naxal force, the Greyhounds.

Move to establish private universities opposed|COIMBATORE|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Association of University Teachers (AUT) has opposed Tamil Nadu Government’s move to permit two private universities. A resolution passed at the general council meeting held here on Sunday said the Government without rhyme or reason had permitted establishment of two private universities. The Government had taken the decision at a time when democratic forces across the country had opposed the Private Universities Bill. The establishment of private universities would undo social control and Government’s regulation over the institutions and lead to education turning into a commodity. Urging the Government to show a humanitarian approach towards members of the JACTTO-GEO who it penalised for participating in protest, the AUT also drew its attention to issues like denial of annual increments, denial of earned leave, etc. that were pending for long before the Director of Collegiate Education. The AUT also took exception to the AICTE’s move permitting self-financing engineering colleges to offer arts and science courses. The AUT elected N. Pasupathy of Erode Arts and Science College president, M.S. Bala Murugan of National College, Tiruchi, general secretary and P. Elangovan of Pachaiyappa's College, Chennai, treasurer.

History beckons: walks gain currency in Chennai|CHENNAI|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|With more people ready to explore the city, discover its nooks and crannies, and sniff out its history, heritage walks are becoming popular in Chennai. Madras Inherited — an initiative spearheaded by Triple O Studio, an architecture studio in the city — has lined up several walks next month, starting from April 6, to appreciate the rich architecture of the city. The walks explore a mix of government buildings and heritage houses, be it revisiting the Indo-Saracenic architecture or learning the city’s origin through Fort St. George, the old villages of George Town, Royapuram or Triplicane. Shalini Ravikumar, head of operations, Madras Inherited, said the idea was to interpret the heritage of the city and its iconic landmarks and create awareness about heritage management. Besides colonial structures, the city is also home to Agraharam-style houses, neo-classical architecture and art-deco style buildings. Heritage conservation  “The community that lives in such heritage houses is not aware of their value and there is no mode of protection as they are not listed as heritage structures. “We are now talking about the intangible aspects of culture and urban patterns. Several people are now interested in conservation,” she said. Historian V. Sriram has organised a large number of heritage walks in 100 different routes, including in Tondiarpet, Purasawalkam and Vepery, since 1999. He could easily be counted among the pioneers of hertiage walks in the city. According to Kombai S. Anwar, historian and documentary filmmaker, the search for identity is making people look deeper into the past. The history taught in textbooks does not connect to the city’s local past. Heritage walks often fill the gap. “We’ve barely tapped into Chennai’s heritage. We have toured 10 different routes in Mylapore and Mount Road alone. We can discover more of the city’s secrets through 150 more different routes,” Mr. Sriram said.

‘BJP will destroy Tamil race’|Karaikudi|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Launching a scathing attack on the BJP, senior Congress leader and former Union Minister P Chidambaram on Sunday warned that the Tamil race would be destroyed if the “venomous BJP” was allowed to gain foothold in the State in the April 18 elections. Addressing party workers to draw strategies for the victory of his son and Congress nominee Karti Chidambaram, pitted against BJP’s H. Raja in Sivaganga, he said the people should be wary that BJP leaders after making vain bid to sow the seeds for the growth of the party, were trying to plant the venomous plants of BJP. If the BJP was allowed to grow in the state, the phrase that ‘Tamizhan endroru inam undu thaniye avarkoru gunamundu’ (Tamils had a unique trait) would disappear along with the Tamil race, he warned. “The BJP is a venomous movement and it is against Tamil race and culture,” Mr Chidambaram claimed. Stating that rationalist leader Periyar E V Ramasamy had sown the seeds of self-respect and rationalist ideals on the Tamil soil to do way with caste discrimination, violence against women, child marriages and promote self-respect marriages, property and equal rights for women, he alleged that the BJP was against Periyar and his ideals. Following the ideals of Periyar, the late K. Kamaraj, C.N. Annadurai and M. Karunanidhi led the State and ensured that all were equal before law and the BJP has now posed challenge to these leaders, he said. The BJP, on the other hand, believed in ‘sanatana dharma’ and imposition of Hindutwa and Hindi, he charged.

Sanitary workers, residents burn waste|TIRUCHI|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Frequent instances of burning waste, mainly plastic carry bags, on road corners and streets, have raised concern among the residents of Tiruchi. Polythene covers, mats, bottles and boxes were among the garbage being burnt on almost on a daily basis in different parts of the city, It is mandatory for residents to hand over domestic and commercial waste to sanitary workers, who visit each and every house for garbage collection daily. Though many residents systematically do the procedure, there are residents, who dump garbage on streets and places where garbage bins were removed. But in some places burning waste is still continuing despite a warning by the Corporation. Besides dumping waste, a few residents invariably burn the garbage. In some cases, sanitary workers too burn the garbage in order to reduce the burden of clearing waste from streets. Burning waste is a common sight on Annamalaiar Street in Aruna Nagar near K. Abishegapuram zonal office of Tiruchi Corporation. Garbage including plastic bags and bottles, dumped by local residents, is being burnt daily. It was seen on Sundays too. Soon, the entire area is polluted. Pedestrians and motorists have to face tough time to avoid inhaling noxious air. Indiscriminate burning of waste is a regular phenomenon at Aruna Nagar. It is being practised for quite some time. M. Karthikeyan of Kumaran Nagar, a motorist, said that he had been witnessing burning of waste regularly. He had seen it at various locations in the city. A section of sanitary workers dump the garbage on street corners and burn them instead of taking it to dump yard. He said the workers might not realise the impact of burning plastic but it was posing a big threat to the environment. Supervisors and officials concerned of the ward, who were supposed to monitor the process of garbage collection, had failed to stop the practice. They should be made accountable for burning plastic waste on streets. Mr. Karthikeyan said that inhaling noxious air could lead to several complications. Elderly persons and children should be saved from the menace.

Temporary bus stand becomes operational in Salem|Salem|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|A temporary bus stand, which was set up at Bose Maidan here to ease operation of town buses, was opened on Sunday. The Salem City Municipal Corporation is reconstructing the old bus stand here under the Smart Cities mission into a two-tier bus stand at a cost of Rs. 92.13 crore. This is perhaps the first time in the State a two-tier bus stand is being built. Considering the time required for reconstruction, the Salem Corporation constructed a temporary bus stand at Bose Maidan, just near the old bus stand, at Rs. 3.9 crore.  Basic amenities The Corporation has provided all basic amenities and equivalent number of shop spaces for persons who rented shops at old bus stand as well. The temporary bus stand has 30 bus bays. Senior Corporation officials said that it would require close to two years to complete reconstruction of the old bus stand and the temporary bus stand was constructed to ease public transportation and avoid traffic congestion in the area. The officials said that over 70 shop spaces and 25 toilets with bath facilities had been built at the temporary bus stand. However, considering the scorching summer, a few shop owners requested for better shade facilities here. One of the fruit sellers said that the shop size was quite small compared to the one in the old bus stand. Hence, they were forced to place fruits under the sun without shade. The Corporation should consider providing some alternative arrangements for this.

Cong. manifesto to be out tomorrow|New Delhi|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Martyr status to paramilitary personnel killed in action, reservation of one-third of government jobs for women, farm loan waiver and stringent laws against fake and paid news could be among the key promises in the Congress manifesto for the Lok Sabha election, besides the minimum income guarantee proposal. A law to automatically disqualify lawmakers who defect to another political party could also be proposed. These and more points have been discussed while drawing up the manifesto, likely to be formally released on Tuesday. Assured income plan The focus of the manifesto will be poverty alleviation through minimum income guarantee or Nyuntam Aay Yojana (NYAY) that will transfer an annual assistance of Rs. 72,000 to the 20% poorest families. “Today, there are 22 lakh job vacancies in the government. We will have these vacancies filled by 31st March, 2020. Devolution of funds from the Centre to each State Govt for healthcare, education etc. will be linked to these vacant positions being filled,” Mr. Gandhi tweeted on Sunday. The Congress will promise universal health care as a right and increase expenditure on health up to 3% of the GDP. For education, the figure is likely to be 6% of the GDP. To tackle the agrarian crisis, the party is likely to propose the setting up of an agriculture and education council on the lines of the GST [Goods and Services Tax] council. Apart from taking out agricultural implements and fertilizers out of the purview of the GST, the document will also promise easier access to credit to the farm sector. The manifesto will also contain industry- friendly promises like scrapping angel tax levied on investors of start-ups.

MKU to follow the rule book on teachers’ qualification|MADURAI|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Madurai Kamaraj University sent a circular last week to its affiliated colleges asking them to ensure that all their teaching staff adhered to the qualification norms prescribed by the University Grants Commission. Directing all the colleges to obtain the mandatory qualification approval for their staff members from the MKU, the university said it might initiate action to disaffiliate their courses in which the faculty were not meeting qualification criteria. A long-pending concern raised by academicians was that a number of colleges, particularly those run in self-financing mode, flouted the UGC norms in terms of qualification and salary paid to teaching staff. The move by the MKU follows the contempt proceedings being heard at the Madras High Court over non-compliance of its 2014 order in a petition filed by one M. Anandakrishnan, in which the court directed the MKU, Manonmaniam Sundaranar University and the University of Madras to ensure adherence to UGC norms. According to the UGC, any college employing a teaching staff must ensure that the person either possessed a Ph.D. or had cleared National Eligibility Test (NET) or State-level Eligibility Test (SET). The circular issued by MKU Registrar V. Chinniah on Thursday said no affiliated college could continue employment of their teaching staff if qualification approval for them had not been obtained from the university in the three months. “If it is brought to the notice of the university that unqualified staff is employed from the academic year 2019-20, the university would initiate disaffiliation proceedings in that particular course and the students in that course would be shifted to another college...,” the circular said. Pay scale R. Murali, convenor, Save Higher Education Movement - Tamil Nadu, welcomed the move. “It is better late then never. The university must stringently enforce the regulations now. However, if some faculty members did not possess the UGC prescribed qualification, they may be given one year time to clear NET or SET,” he said. He highlighted that the circular did not speak about UGC-stipulated pay scale. “The UGC regulations now say a minimum of Rs. 50,000 per month be paid to those engaged even on a temporary basis. But there are colleges that do not even pay Rs. 10,000. How can we expect quality then?,” he asked. A faculty member of one of the affiliated colleges, stressed that the university must ensure that doctorate degrees possessed by the faculty members were as per the latest UGC regulations for awarding of Ph.D. and M.Phil. degrees.

‘Time to promote single teacher school model’|CHENNAI|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The single teacher school model should be not just emulated, but also replicated across the country, said N. Murali, Chairman, Kasturi and Sons Limited. Mr. Murali was speaking at the 13th annual day celebrations of Single Teacher Schools, a unit of Swami Vivekananda Rural Development Society, held in the city on Sunday. “India lacks in education, with a woeful inadequacy of teachers and schools. But the condition in Tamil Nadu is better compared to other States,” he said. “Many schools in other States have single teachers by default because many of the teachers don’t turn up. But here it has a very positive connotation for holistic development,” Mr. Murali added. The seed for these schools was sown 13 years ago by Dayananda Saraswathi. The motto is that if children could not go to school, the schools should be taken to children in remote villages, he said. Positive thinking S. Vedantam, founder-director, Single Teacher Schools, said that values were lost in today’s education system. “Our [single teacher] schools are free from everything, including the caste system. Due to this, there is positive thinking,” he said. K.N. Krishnamurthy, president, Single Teachers Schools and Akhila Srinivasan, chairman, fundraising committee, spoke at the event.

Use vote power to unseat self-serving leaders, Kamal appeals to electorate|PUDUCHERRY|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Actor-turned-politician and Makkal Neethi Maiam (MNM) founder Kamal Haasan on Sunday shared real-life incidents and anecdotes as he urged the electorate to use the power of votes to unseat self-serving leaders for whom welfare of the masses mattered the least. Addressing a campaign rally to support MNM candidate for the Lok Sabha, MAS Subramanian at the AFT Grounds, Mr. Haasan reminded the voters that in a democracy the ultimate power to make a change for the better was with the people. As one “hailing from an industry of storytellers”, Mr. Haasan narrated a story of a stork that promised fish of a land of abundance only to kill and feast until it met the same fate at the hands of a crab. “Show the power of that crab when you go to vote on April 18,” he exhorted the crowd. As he shared his next story of a bed-ridden woman in Mannargudi, Mr. Haasan remarked that this was a true story but which had nothing to do with the so-called “mafia”. Lamenting how even wonderful places now carried the curse by association with some errant politicians, he recalled how MNM volunteers visiting the place after it was ravaged by Cyclone Gaja had helped put a bed-ridden woman back on her feet. “We will ensure that she will be able to go to work”, he said to cheers from the crowd even as a photograph of the woman in better health and her family appeared on the screen behind the dais. Stating that both Tamil Nadu and Puducherry were likewise in a “bed-ridden” state, he urged the people to vote for the MNM and help nurse the States back to a healthy condition. Reserving his last anecdote for those young voters who vented their ire on Twitter, Mr. Haasan wanted them to channelise their anger for a better future for themselves and the nation. He recalled how he himself was ridiculed as a Twitter creature, yet in a matter of months had joined the electoral battleground and of how he was dismissed as urbane and yet started MNM campaign from the villages. “Sometimes, your enemies give you the best ideas,” he joked. Mr. Haasan, who also launched the MNM manifesto, said everything in it was well-thought out and not just empty promises. For instance, the promise of 50 lakh jobs was done after a great deal of thought by a cross-section of experts and involved opportunities across verticals, he said. Mr. Haasan also shared a personal connection with the city stating that the first thing that came to mind about the city was that it was the land that gave refuge to the revolutionary Tamil poet Subramania Bharati. He recalled his week-long stay in the city over three decades ago to walk the streets that the poet walked as part of a biopic project of his mentor and filmmaker K. Balachander. Dr. Subramanian said the governments of the Congress and its rival the AINRC were responsible for the mess that Puducherry was in. MNM office-bearers from Puducherry and neighbouring districts also spoke.

Two ballot units will be placed for voting: Namakkal Collector|Namakkal|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|With 29 candidates contesting elections in the Namakkal Lok Sabha constituency, two ballot units would be placed to cast votes, said District Collector M. Asia Mariam. The Collector said to presspersons that symbols had been allotted for all 29 candidates and the list had been sent to higher officials for approval. The symbols and names would be loaded on to the machines once the list was approved. She mentioned that 20 percentage voting units were available in reserve in the constituency. “Arrangements for postal ballots are also being made and postal ballots will be collected until the day of counting, May 23,” she added. Ms. Mariam said that the Election Commission had developed a separate portal for serviced men to vote in the elections. Regarding seizures, Ms. Mariam said that till date, Rs. 55,30,500 of unaccounted cash had been seized by election officials and based on verification, close to Rs. 50 lakh had been returned. Officials also seized 37.93 kg of gold and 8.82 kg of silver. The seized gold had been returned based on verification. Ms. Mariam said that two cases had been registered in the district for poll code violations and necessary action had been taken on 21 complaints received through cVIGIL application in the district. General Observer for Namakkal constituency Vani Mohan was also present.
Jet Airways pilots defer strike plan|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The letter said, “The collective [strike] call is hence deferred to April 15.” Senior pilots said most of the NAG members were not in favour of going on strike. “They are all young and don’t want aircraft to be on the ground but keep flying. In fact many of them have been asking to be rostered for duty on the few flights that continue to be in operation,” an official said. Officials informed that though former chairman Naresh Goyal had announced his stepping down on March 25, he actually ceased to hold the position only from March 29. “It was on March 29, that the State Bank of India (SBI) received a letter to this effect in the format it had sought. This had caused the delay, but the moment it happened, SBI released funds that were used to clear pending dues,” a senior official said. Among the consortium of banks, only SBI has released funds, he added. Senior pilots said that under the present circumstances going on strike would be like arm-twisting the government directly. “There is just the CEO, officiating with his limited powers. The interim board is yet to be formed. The same is the case with the interim managing committee and there is no chairman. The SBI is yet to formally get on board,” a senior official said, explaining that a strike now would not yield the desired results.

Same promises again: Modi|New Delhi|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|In an apparent dig at the Congress’ minimum income poll promise and the Gandhi family, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said its four generations had made the same promises but nothing happened, and first-time voters should see the “track record” of those pitching for eliminating poverty. Addressing a ‘Main bhi chowkidar’ event here, he also said ‘Mission Shakti’, demonstrating India’s anti-satellite missile capability, had nothing to do with polls and hit out at those opposing his announcement of the test in an address to the nation. “The U.S., Russia and China did ASAT tests openly. Why should we hide it?” Mr. Modi said, replying to a question at the event that was beamed across the country at 500 places.

An idea against divisiveness: Congress|New Delhi|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Wayanad, Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s choice as his second constituency, is arguably the safest seat for the Congress in south India and among the safest in the entire country. Mr. Gandhi’s main rival will be P.P. Suneer of the CPI. The BJP has a marginal presence in the constituency. The Congress chief had been undecided over contesting from Wayanad, considering the multiple battles of perception that it brings. First, while he has been pointedly trying to define the 2019 election as a fight to save India from advancing Hindutva, he will end up facing off with the Left, an adversary in Kerala but an ally nationally. Second, he will be accused of “running away” from Amethi. Third, the more fundamental question: whether contesting two seats will be seen as a sign of weakness. After weighing the pros and cons, on which he received divergent opinions, the decision was taken. Congress sources close to Mr. Gandhi are emphatic that they sense no challenge in Amethi. But the volatility in Uttar Pradesh, despite the formation of the SP-BSP alliance and its declaration of support for Mr. Gandhi in Amethi, is palpable. The battle lines in the critical State have not been defined yet, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s campaign blitz has only begun. That said, the reason for national leaders contesting a second seat is less because of any insecurity in one seat and more for expanding their personal imprint to critical territories, as Mr. Modi himself did in 2014 by contesting from Vadodara in Gujarat and Varanasi in U.P. A step ahead of BJP Congress leaders explain Mr. Gandhi’s decision in those terms. “Rahul Gandhi sees India as an integrated one, with equal prominence for all regions and diversities. The decision to contest from Wayanad is to contest Mr. Modi’s divisive politics, and to end the BJP’s dream of opening its account in Kerala this time,” Congress general secretary K.C. Venugopal, a close confidant of Mr. Gandhi, toldThe Hindu. A surge in the south will be critical for the party’s comeback bid. In 2004 and 2009, it was the overwhelming victories in the south that catapulted the party to power. Party units and allies in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu were also keen on having Mr. Gandhi contest from their States. While the Congress is trying to keep the narrative as a national contest against the BJP, Wayanad could mark a complete rupture between the Congress and the Left. The formation of the United Progressive Alliance in 2004, in which the then CPI(M) general secretary Harkishan Singh Surjeet played a decisive role, was the expression of a broad consensus that the fault-line of Indian politics was whether this should be a Hindu majoritarian nation or not. That conceptual clarity was lost with the break between the Congress and the Left over the India-U.S. civil nuclear deal, in 2008. Feeble efforts were made for a reconciliation this year and both sides were even trying to make an alliance in West Bengal, only weeks ago. Kerala is the Left’s only standing citadel at the moment. Threatened in its stronghold, the Left could turn bitter towards the Congress. “Congress does not see this as a fight against the Left at all. Wayanad is a sitting Congress seat, where the Left had little chance of winning anyway,” Mr. Venugopal said.

Rahul’s Wayanad choice leaves Left fuming|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|CPI national secretary D. Raja said the decision was devoid of logic. “Who is the Congress’s main political enemy? The Left or the BJP? Mr. Gandhi claims every day that he is fightingchowkidaarand the BJP, but they [the Congress] have chosen to contest against the CPI in Kerala. What message do they [the Congress] want to convey to the entire country,” he asked. The Congress should have instead chosen a seat in Delhi where the BJP is the key opponent, he said. But the Congress said the decision was meant to send out a message to south Indians that they were deeply valued. “This is not a fight with the Left or the Right. This is a fight to espouse the aspirations of the people of south India, including the people of Kerala. This is a fight to give a befitting reply to those forces that are attacking the culture, language, the way of life and the deep connect between two portions of India,” Mr. Surjewala said. Wayanad is one of the safest seats for the Congress. M.I. Shanavas of the Congress won it in 2009 and again in 2014. His victory margin in 2009 was over 1.5 lakh votes, but it dipped to 20,270 votes in 2014. The seat has been vacant since his death in November 2018. The Congress is hoping that the decision will help to cement the support of the minority communities. The consolidation of the minority votes helped the LDF sweep the 2016 Assembly election. “People of Kerala know very well who is fighting the BJP. Who is taking a firm and consistent stand against them [the BJP]. I don’t think there will be any confusion on that,” Mr. Karat said. The demand that Mr. Gandhi contest from a southern State was first raised by the former Karnataka Chief Minister, Siddaramaiah. Soon, party leaders from Tamil Nadu and Kerala followed suit. To drive home their point, these leaders said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had contested from Vadodara and Varanasi in 2014. Mr. Gandhi’s mother and grandmother had contested, at least once, from two seats.

Man arrested for rape, murder of minor|Coimbatore|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Thudiyalur All Women Police on Sunday arrested Santhosh Kumar (32) of Uliyampalayam, Thondamuthur, on charges of raping and murdering a seven-year-old girl on March 25. The police claimed that Kumar, an interior decorator, had confessed to the crime during interrogation. Provisions of the POCSO Act have been invoked against him. Kumar, who had befriended the girl while staying at his grandmother’s house since January this year to take care of her, had sexually assaulted the girl twice before and for the third time when the girl resisted his attempts, he had gagged and strangulated her at his grandmother’s two-room house. The grandmother, who was bedridden in the other room, died around 9 p.m. on the day, a few hours after Kumar had allegedly raped and murdered the girl. He wrapped the girl’s body in his T-shirt and hid it in the second room before informing relatives of his grandmother’s death. In the wee hours of March 26, when the relatives were asleep, he took the girl’s body and tossed it in a bush near the grandmother’s house, the Police said and added that they had recovered the T-shirt and established that it was Kumar’s. Initially, on being informed about the incident, the Thudiyalur Police had registered a murder case and began investigation. The next day, when it came to light that the girl had been raped, they transferred the case to the Thudiyalur All Women Police. By then, based on the instructions of the West Zone IG K. Periaiah, the police had formed 14 teams to arrest the perpetrators of the crime. The teams interrogated six persons and eliminated four from the list of suspects after the first round of investigation. In the subsequent rounds of investigation, the Police said Santhosh Kumar confessed to the crime and also admitted that the T-shirt used to wrap the girl’s body was his. Kumar, who was married a few years ago, got separated from his wife within a month of the wedding. He then moved to his grandmother’s house in January to look after her after his grandfather who died in November last year. Later in the evening, the police took the accused to the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital before taking him to the Magistrate’s house for remand.

Hostile reception at mosque|Madurai|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST| Cooperation Minister 'Sellur' K. Raju faced hostility when he attempted to seek votes for the AIADMK’s candidate for the Madurai Parliamentary constituency from those coming out of a mosque in Pudur after offering prayers.

Maran harps on water scarcity|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|“Everywhere I go, I see people waiting with buckets to fetch water,” the former Union Minister Dayanidhi Maran said on Sunday, even as many in Villivakkam were walking with empty plastic pots to get water. Speaking toThe Hindu,Mr. Maran, who won twice from the constituency in 2004 and 2009 but lost in 2014, lashed out at the State government for not taking initiatives to solve the water problem in the city. “They merely claim that the issue will be solved. But what is the reality? The same situation occurred in 2004. We should have plans to save water,” he said. Perennial struggle Forty-year-old Rubi Ekanantham, a resident of Seeyalam Street in Villivakkam, spoke of her perennial struggle to get drinking water. “Only on alternate days, we get drinking water and we don’t get enough. Also, we constantly encounter sewage blocks. We have been living with this problem for years now,” she said. Mr. Maran also said the unemployment rate had peaked. “During our tenure, IT graduates were given a starting salary of Rs. 40,000 but now many get as low as Rs. 8,000. Graduates serve as delivery boys for online food delivery services,” he rued. The DMK candidate flayed the AIADMK governments from 2011 for not having focussed on the city’s road infrastructure. With no new flyovers, the city’s traffic congestion had increased, he said, reminding the voters that many of the city’s flyovers were built during the DMK rule. Flanked by the party’s local leaders B. Ranganathan and P.K. Sekar Babu during his campaign, he praised DMK president M.K. Stalin for taking the right decision to form an alliance with the Congress to fight the 2019 Lok Sabha election. “The people of Tamil Nadu have developed hatred towards the Modi government for ignoring the people of Tamil Nadu for the last five years,” he charged.

A bond for life to save a garden in Mumbai|MUMBAI|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|South Mumbai residents deployed a novel idea on Sunday to register their protest against the city’s ambitious Coastal Road project. A recent peaceful march was stopped by the police for lack of permission. In an approach merging Sunderlal Bahuguna’s Chipko movement andMunnabhai MBBS’Gandhian semantics, around 200 residents tied pieces of cloth asrakhisto over 100 trees in the Tata Garden on Bhulabhai Desai Road. Close to half of the green lung will be lost to the project. The Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai, or BMC, has begun work on the 9.98 km coastal road that will run from Marine Drive at the city’s southern end to Worli, where it could connect to the sea link road that runs up to Bandra. The project is facing resistance from several quarters, including fishermen and residents of Breach Candy, Peddar Road and Malabar Hill, where the new road will alter localities as well as the coastline. Fishermen have already moved the Bombay High Court seeking a stay on the reclamation work. Activists have voiced concern that the large-scale reclamation for the project will lead to flooding in these areas. TheRakhi Bandho Vriksha Bachao Abhiyansaw senior citizens as well as children joining in with placards, little over a fortnight after the police halted a peaceful protest. “In December, we realised that about 60% of the garden is going to be affected by the road. Even if 40% is left, who is going to be able to access it? So, it’s as good as gone,” said Dr. Nilesh Baxi, member of the Breach Candy Welfare Group. A child’s poignant placard, which said, ‘Why me, I have just started,’ captured the mood of the activists. While the fishermen are demanding a stay on the coastal road project, South Mumbai residents are demanding a re-look at the alignment, stating much of the reclamation is unnecessary.

Delhi HC rejects HUL plea against Emami’s TV ad|New Delhi|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Delhi High Court has rejected a plea by Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL), manufacturer of the ‘Fair & Lovely’ range of skin lightening/fairness cream, claiming that a TV commercial by Emami Limited for its ‘Fair & Handsome’ product makes fun of a male using a ladies’ cream. “In my opinion, overall the commercial advertisement does not leave an impression that in any manner it disparages the product of the plaintiff [HUL],” Justice Jayant Nath remarked. HUL had moved the High Court against Emami’s TV commercial, which began airing around September last year. The commercial had Bollywood actor Vidyut Jammwal saying, “Ab to Ladkiyon ki cream chhodo Mr. Lovely”. HUL, which introduced ‘Fair & Lovely’ in 1975, claimed that the commercial disparaged its product. “It is pleaded that the said commercial is claiming that the product of the plaintiff’s brand ‘Fair & Lovely’ is rubbish and inefficacious and restricted to only women while the product of the defendant “Fair and Handsome” is much more effective and useful,” HUL’s plea said. It additionally contended that ‘Fair & Lovely’ was initially used as a fairness cream which was gender neutral, though it was largely promoted as a fairness cream for women. HUL said almost 30% of the consumers are men who use the same product. Around 2006, to specifically target the men’s segment of the population, HUL launched its product ‘Fair & Lovely Men.’ Subsequently, this was renamed as ‘Men’s Fair & Lovely.’ The High Court noted that the “TV commercial no doubt seems to make fun of a male using a ladies’ cream. Can it be said that this advertisement on account of the said dialogue stated is false or misleading or unfair or deceptive? Does it amount to generic disparagement. The answer is in the negative”. ‘Plaintiff oversensitive’ Justice Nath said, “In my view, the plaintiff is being over sensitive on the story line of the TV commercial”. “The defendant [Emami] had enough room to play around for making the advertisement. In view of the literature that has been posted on its own website by the plaintiff, it also cannot be said that prima facie the statements made in the advertisement regarding using of women’s cream by men is false,” he remarked. The High Court ruled, “It cannot prima facie be concluded that the said TV commercial seeks to slander the goods of the plaintiff.”  The TV commercial no doubt seems to make fun of a male using a ladies’ cream. Can it be said that this ad on account of the said dialogue stated is false or misleading or unfair or deceptive? Does it amount to generic disparagement. The answer is in the negative Justice Jayant Nath Delhi High Court Judge
Major Gogoi to face seniority loss for Srinagar hotel episode|NEW DELHI|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Major Leetul Gogoi, who is facing an inquiry after being seen with a local woman in a Srinagar hotel, has been recommended reduction in seniority after a court martial, Army sources said on Sunday. “The court martial has recommended a seniority loss for Major Gogoi. The sentence has to be formally approved by the competent authority in the Army,” a senior officer said. The approval seems certain and the seniority loss is likely to be six months. Last August, orders were issued to initiate disciplinary action after a Court of Inquiry (CoI) held him accountable for “fraternising” with a local in spite of instructions to the contrary and being away from the place of duty. His driver Sameer Malla, who was charged for unauthorised absence from the unit, is likely to be given a “severe reprimand.” Mr. Malla was posted with 53 sector of Rashtriya Rifles in Jammu and Kashmir. On May 23, 2018, Major Gogoi was detained by the local police in Srinagar after a scuffle when he tried to get into a hotel with an 18-year-old local woman. Following this, Army ordered a CoI to ascertain the facts. Army Chief Gen Bipin Rawat, during a visit to the State shortly after the incident, said action would be taken if he was found guilty. “If any officer of the Army is found guilty of any offence, we will take the strictest possible action,” he had stated. Major Gogoi was earlier in the news in April 2017 when he used a local, Farooq Dar, as a human shield against stone throwers during the Srinagar Lok Sabha by-election. On this occasion, he was awarded a commendation card by Gen. Rawat in appreciation of his sustained efforts in counter-insurgency operations.


Kaduvetti Guru’s sister, Veerappan’s wife join TVK|CHENNAI|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Former PMK strongman and ex-MLA Kaduvetti Guru’s sister Senthamarai and slain forest brigand Veerappan’s wife Muthulakshmi joined the Tamizhaga Vazhvurimai Katchi (TVK) in Chennai on Sunday in the presence of party founder T. Velmurugan. The family of Kaduvetti Guru fell out with the PMK leadership following his illness and subsequent death. Earlier in the day, an association of 18 Vanniyar Sangams resolved to campaign against PMK founder S. Ramadoss and his family members in all constituencies where the party was contesting. The meeting, which had Mr. Velmurugan as its special invitee, resolved to urge the State government to implement the G.O. issued over the sub quota for Vanniyars. The coordinator of these 18 Vanniyar Sangam associations, Nagarathinam, clarified they would not campaign against the PMK candidates, but only against Mr. Ramadoss’s family. Mr. Velmurugan said that the State government must allow the construction of a memorial for forest brigand Veerappan and also favour the release of Mathayyan in that case.

Victims of Holi attack in Bhondsi in shock over FIR after assault|GURUGRAM|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|“Can you see thetiranga(tricolour) fluttering on top of that three-storey house? That’s their house,” said a motorcyclist, pointing towards a building painted in gold, with glass facade. The house stands out amidst the single-storey structures of Bhoop Singh Nagar in the Bhondsi area off Gurgaon— the home of the Muslim family attacked by rightwing musclemen on Holi. “We put up the Indian flag when we build this house around two years ago. It has been there since then. We are proud Indians,” asserts Mohammad Sajid, lying on a bed with his right hand in a cast and injuries on his left leg and back. To his right sits Mohammad Abid, 23, leaning against the wall near the window. His left leg is in a cast and he wears a cervical collar after the brutal assault earlier this month. Mr. Sajid, 44, recalls that he and his elder brother Mohammad Jamshed, 57, had come to Gurugram from Baghpat in Uttar Pradesh in search of livelihood around 15 years ago. While he set up a workshop to repair cooking gas stoves in Ghasola village, Mr. Jamshed started a furniture shop in neighbouring Badshahpur. Soon their three other brothers also migrated to Gurugram. “We never faced discrimination because of our religion. It happened to us for the first time,” says Mr. Jamshed of the Holi attack. But he refuses to speculate on whether the brutal attack on his family, which has left six of them severely injured, had anything to do with the growing atmosphere of religious intolerance in the country. “We are businessmen. We know little about politics. We cannot say why it happened. But it all started after the two men on a motorcycle hurled religious slurs at us without a reason and told us to go to Pakistan. We were playing cricket away from the main road. It was all unprovoked,” claims Mohmmad Dilshad, the complainant in the case. His left arm was also fractured in the attack. But more than the attack, it is the registration of FIR against the two members of his family that had left them shocked, said Mr. Dilshad. “We were beaten up. We are the victims in the case. But now we are made the accused,” he said. “Though we have met the Commissioner of Police and he has assured security and justice, we are sceptical after the registration of the case against us,” says Mr. Jamshed, adding that they are too scared to venture out and return to work. “Our shops are closed since the attack took place. Despite round-the-clock police presence, we have seen people loitering around suspiciously adding to our fear,” he said.

IG relieved from election duty for opening fire in the air|ARIYALUR|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|A senior police officer of Haryana cadre, deputed as the Police Observer for the Chidambaram (Reserved) Parliamentary constituency in Tamil Nadu, created a flutter when he opened fire in the air in the early hours on Sunday. Later in the day, the Election Commission removed him from poll duty. Ariyalur falls under the Chidambaram constituency. According to police sources, Hemant Kalson, an officer in the rank of Inspector-General, who had reported for duty in Ariyalur on Friday, came out of Circuit House, where he was staying, at 1 a.m. and demanded the gun in the possession of Armed Reserve constable Manibalan. The constable, who was posted for security, obliged Mr. Kalson. The officer suddenly opened nine rounds in the air. After a while, Mr. Kalson handed over the “INSAS rifle” to Mr. Manibalan and returned to his suite. The officer was said to have been under the influence of alcohol. On being informed by Mr. Manibalan, M. Vijayalakshmi, District Election Officer, who is also the Returning Officer of Chidambaram constituency and V.R. Srinivasan, Superintendent of Police, conducted an inquiry. While being questioned, Mr. Kalson claimed that he opened fire to check if the gun was in a working condition. Leaves town The DEO then sent a preliminary report to Chief Electoral Officer Satyabrata Sahoo. Within hours, the Election Commission issued an order relieving Mr. Kalson from poll duty with immediate effect. He later took a flight from Tiruchi. Based on a complaint by Manibalan, the Ariyalur police booked a case against Mr. Kalson under Section 336 (negligent action to endanger human life) of Indian Penal Code. When asked whether the IPS officer was inebriated when the incident took place, a senior police officer toldThe Hinduthat an investigation was on to ascertain it. Though none was injured, the officer acted negligently endangering human life. An RDO (Revenue Divisional Officer) level enquiry has been ordered into the incident. In a related move, the Election Commission on Sunday appointed Siddaramappa, an IPS belonging to Karnataka, as the Police Observer to the Chidambaram constituency in the place of Mr. Kalson. Mr. Siddaramappa is expected to join duty on Monday.

Seizures aplenty, but follow-up measures found wanting|CHENNAI|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Though Tamil Nadu continues to retain the top spot in the seizure of unaccounted cash and valuables in the run-up to the April 18 Lok Sabha election, what stands in sharp contrast is the failure to take cases of voter bribery to their logical conclusion. Though the practice of bribing voters has been prevalent for the past many decades, it assumed alarming proportions since the infamous ‘Thirumangalam formula’ was used to bribe voters during the first decade of this millennium. The expertise with which cash was distributed to voters through milkmen and newspaper delivery boys, apart from party cadre, has since been mastered by parties in subsequent elections, especially during bypolls. It peaked during the bypoll to the R.K. Nagar constituency in 2017. Tamil Nadu was the first State where election notifications to two constituencies – Aravakurichi and Thanjavur – were rescinded during the 2016 Assembly polls following evidence of large-scale bribery of voters by three candidates belonging to major Dravidian parties. Similar action was taken in R.K. Nagar. But in all three cases, the candidates, on whose behalf the voters were allegedly bribed, entered the fray again and went on to win. Also, a cross-section of voters has justified receiving money in exchange for votes. Gandhiya Makkal Iyakkam founder Thamizharuvi Manian said, “Corrupt politicians have corrupted the minds of the voters and that is the worst thing that can happen in a democracy. One of the voters I met justified the cash-for-vote practice, saying the Rs. 20,000 he received from a party helped him come out of usury.” Unless there was a change in the voters’ mindset, no transformation would come about in the conduct of elections, he added. The lacunae in the existing system, such as the absence of permanent officers of the Election Commission and its subsequent dependence on the State government for following up on cases of electoral bribery, have perpetuated this trend. Though election observers specified reasons for recommending the EC to rescind the polls in Aravakurichi, Thanjavur and R.K. Nagar, no effective follow-up action was taken in the first two cases. In R.K. Nagar, an FIR was registered and, in September 2017, the then Chief Electoral Officer informed the Madras High Court that he would follow up on the case. But he was transferred. During a hearing of a case in December 2018, the court was taken aback on being informed that the FIR registered earlier was quashed by a single judge. The delay of the judiciary in dealing with electoral offences is a cause for concern, said former Chief Election Commissioner N. Gopalaswami. “The offenders should be brought to book at the earliest. Unless that happens, they won’t be deterred from bribing voters.”  The offenders should be brought to book at the earliest. Unless that happens, they won’t be deterred from bribing votersN.

SI, home guard suspended for damaging youth’s two-wheeler|CHENNAI|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|After a video of a home guard damaging a two-wheeler under the supervision of a Sub-Inspector (SI) near War Memorial went viral on social media, the Chennai city police has suspended SI Haribabu and home guard Mohan. A video taken by a resident near the War Memorial shows a home guard damaging the two-wheeler with a baton in full public view. He first damages the rear view mirrors. The SSI gives instructions to smash the front of the vehicle also. After a couple of minutes, a youth comes to take the vehicle. The SSI comes down from the police vehicle as the home guard continues to damage the two-wheeler which was eventually driven away by the youth. The Fort police station personnel initially claimed that the youth had come to purchase ganja and the SI had warned the youth to leave the place. As he did not, the vehicle was damaged, they said. After the video went viral on the social media with many raising questions about the high handedness of the police, the senior officials have decided to suspend the two involved in the incident, sources said. Senior officials, however, refused to identify the SI and the home guard personnel. They only said the SI was attached to the police control room and was on patrolling duty.

MiG-27 crashes in Jodhpur, but pilot ejects to safety|NEW DELHI|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|A MiG-27 UPG fighter aircraft of the Air Force crashed in Jodhpur on Sunday morning. The pilot has ejected safely. “The aircraft took off from Air Force Station Uttarlai in Rajasthan at 1127 hrs on Sunday for a routine sortie. It crashed at 1145 hrs, approximately 120 km south of Jodhpur,” the IAF said in a statement. “The pilot ejected safely and has been recovered by search and rescue helicopter. The pilot is safe and preliminary investigations have revealed no damage to any person or property on the ground,” the statement added. The pilot had reported engine problems before ejecting. A Court of Inquiry has been ordered to investigate the cause of the accident. The IAF has suffered a series of accidents in the last month and the Mig-27 fleet, too, saw several accidents this year. The last of the Russian-origin jets are in the process of being phased out. Last month, a Mig-27 that took off on a training mission from Jaisalmer crashed near the Pokhran range in Rajasthan. In September 2018, another Mig-27 crashed in an open area in Deolia Kalan village in the Jodhpur district. The pilots ejected safely in both the instances.  High casualty The IAF has lost at least 10 personnel in crashes this year. As India and Pakistan were engaged in aerial combat last month a day after the Balakot air strike, a Mi-17 helicopter crashed in the Budgam district of Jammu & Kashmir killing all six personnel on board and a civilian on the ground. Preliminary investigation indicate that it was shot down by ground-based air defence systems of the IAF in a case of mistaken fire. Just ahead of the Aero India in Bengaluru in February this year, two Hawk Advanced Jet Trainers practising aerobatics crashed into each other, killing one pilot.

Unaccounted cash seized in Tiruppur, Coimbatore|Coimbatore|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Officials of a flying squad in Tiruppur on Sunday seized Rs. 1.09 lakh from a car that was on its way to Pollachi.

Spider research yet to pick up pace in India, say experts|Mumbai|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The recent discovery of a new species of jumping spiders in Aarey Colony has had arachnologists — specialists in spiders and related animals — and wildlife experts call for a greater focus on studying spiders in India. While the last major research was conducted between the 1990s and 2000s by Dr. Manju Siliwal, a senior arachnologist who specialises in mygalomorphs, experts believe a lot of diversities of spiders are yet to be discovered in the country. In a study published on Saturday by Russian peer-reviewed journalArthropoda Selecta, a team-led by arachnologists Rajesh Sanap, Dr. John Caleb and biologist Anuradha Joglekar announced that they had discovered a new species of jumping spiders in the city’s Aarey Milk Colony. Named after additional principal chief conservator of forest, Sunil Limaye, Jerzego sunillimaye was found for the first time in 2016. In the research that spanned over the next three years, researchers were able to understand the natural history of this species and explore interesting aspects that were not documented before. “We were able to explore different habitats such as grasslands, rocky and forested patches to find out the habitat these tiny spiders preferred. Several males and females of various life stages were observed throughout the years, specifically in the monsoon, when the females were observed guarding their egg sacs, while males were seen wandering under the rocks,” Mr. Sanap said. 1,800 spider species While other species of jumping spiders such as the Langelurillus Onyx, Langelurillus Lacteus — both described in 2017 — and Piranthus decorus — recorded for the first time in 122 years in the area — have inhabited the Aarey Colony, more studies pertaining to their complete biology, habits and interactions with other species are yet to be carried out. While there are 4,800 species of spiders in the world, India alone accounts for 1,800 spider species. While the research in other parts of the world such as Thailand, Germany, Canada and the United States has been steady, experts said it is yet to pick up pace in India. “Spiders are important creatures as they are pest-controllers. They are like the tigers of the microhabitat world. Pulling them out could cause ecological imbalance,” Mr. Sanap said. According to Dr. John Caleb, a Chennai-based arachnologist, who has been researching spiders for the last 10 years, species of spiders other than wolf, crab, orb-weaver and ground spiders have not received enough attention in India.

Plea to ensure generic drugs are prescribed|New Delhi|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|A petition filed before the Delhi High Court has sought directions to the Centre and the Medical Council of India (MCI) to ensure that doctors prescribe generic medicines. The petition filed in public interest by advocate Amit Sahni contends that the Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushdhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) was introduced in 2008 to lower healthcare costs by providing quality generic medicines at affordable prices. The MCI had on January 21, 2013, issued a circular to deans of all medical colleges, directors of all hospitals, and presidents of all State medical councils, calling on doctors to prescribe drugs with generic names as far as possible. The authorities have failed to ensure this despite clear statutory directions, Mr. Sahni claimed. He said the generic medicines work in the same way and provide the same clinical benefit as the brand-name versions and cost 5% to 60% less than the branded counterparts. He argued that a citizen from the lower middle or economically backward class, who may not be able to approach court due to lack of awareness, would benefit from a direction in this regard. The petitioner sought strict compliance of regulation 1.5 of the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002, which mandates that every physician “prescribe drugs with generic names legibly and preferably in capital letters”. He claimed that the generic medicine stores were not available in and around government hospitals or other major private hospitals. To benefit the poor, he has asked for directions to set up generic medicine centres under the PMBJP near all super-speciality hospitals across India. The court is likely to take up the plea on Monday.

Maoists call for bandh on April 5|VISAKHAPATNAM|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The banned CPI (Maoist) have called for a bandh on April 5, in the Agency areas of Visakhapatnam, in protest against the alleged killing of two tribal farmers by the anti-Naxal force, the Greyhounds. According to Maoists, the two who were killed by the Greyhounds were innocent farmers and not members of the banned organisation, as claimed by the security forces. The two, Batti Bhushanam (52) and Sidaari Jamadhar (30), were reportedly killed on March 15 near Buradamamidi village in Pedakodapalle panchayat of Pedabayulu mandal in Visakhapatnam district. In a letter released on Saturday, the Maoists apart from giving the bandh call also claimed that the State government was using repressive tactics to exploit the natural resources in the tribal areas. The letter was addressed by MKVB (Malkangiri-Koraput – Visakhapatnam Border) Division secretary Kailasam.

Arunthathiyars feel left out by parties|CHENNAI|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The issue of “adequate political representation” of Arunthathiyars, a Scheduled Caste, has again come to the fore with the community getting a negligible number of party ticket in the Lok Sabha election. Barring the AIADMK and the AMMK, which have nominated one candidate each in The Nilgiris, no major party has fielded anyone from the community. K. Kathirkamu of the AMMK, a member of the community, is contesting again in the Assembly byelection from Periyakulam after getting disqualified under the anti-defection law in September 2017. Two representatives of the community — Valasai E. Ravichandran of the Arunthathi Makkal Katchi and A. Nagarasaan of the Adi Tamizhaar Munnetra Kazhagam — feel aggrieved over basic issues. They claim that their community’s “real strength” is over 50 lakh. But when an official committee of the State government carried out the categorisation of the communities 10 years ago, the community’s numerical strength was shown as lesser than what prevailed earlier. Delimitation blow Mr. Nagarasaan, whose outfit is supporting the AMMK, says: “In the Assembly, we must be having at least 15 MLAs. But we lost heavily in the delimitation in 2008. In the western belt, where members of the community live in large numbers, there are only eight Assembly constituencies reserved for the SCs. Quoting this aspect, major parties plead helplessness in giving the ticket to us.” Conceding that his party did not have any MLA from the community, V.P. Duraisamy, deputy general secretary of the DMK and former Deputy Speaker, recalls that it was while his party was in power that the reservation was provided to the community. “It was a historic decision,” he says. Although former Union Minister A. Raja is not an Arunthathiyar, his services to the people of The Nilgiris and the party are “laudable,” says Mr. Duraisamy, who lost in Rasipuram in the 2016 Assembly elections. Mr. Raja, who was elected in 2009 and defeated five years later, has been in touch with the voters, he says. His point was in response to observations of the DMK’s critics who question the move to field Mr. Raja again from The Nilgiris although he hails from Perambalur. Vanni Arasu, deputy general secretary of the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi, admits that a lot needs to be done to improve the standard of living of the community. Whenever possible, his party accommodated representatives of the Arunthathiyars in the distribution of seats at the time of elections, even though its emphasis had been on highlighting the plight of Scheduled Castes in general. There were other reasons why the community had not progressed to the extent of many other castes under the SC category. Not vociferous M. Bharathan, State organiser of the Ambedkar Kalvi Centenary Movement and who has been a member of the State committee of the Untouchability Eradication Front, an organ of the CPI (M), complains that not many leaders who claim to be fighting for the cause of the Arunthathiyars highlight the need for the elimination of manual scavenging, besides proper implementation of the separate reservation. Pointing out that although he belongs to Devendrakula Vellalar, he said he had been highlighting issues and problems of the Arunthathiyars. “Sections of my caste do not relish what I have been doing,” he says. Mr. Ravichandran, who supports the AIADMK, wants a committee constituted to monitor the implementation of the separate reservation. Pattas, official documents endorsing occupation of land, should be issued to conservancy workers in urban areas for the houses in which they had been living. Statues should be installed in Chennai for L.C. Gurusami and H.M. Jaganathan, who had impressed upon the community the need for formal education about 90 years ago, he adds.  In the western belt, where members of the community live in large numbers, there are only eight Assembly constituencies reserved for the SCs A. Nagarasaan,Adi Tamizhaar Munnetra Kazhagam

Another plea to restrain Stalin from linking CM with Kodanad case|CHENNAI|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|AIADMK spokesperson R.M. Babu Murugavel has approached the Madras High Court seeking a direction to Election Commission of India to restrain the DMK and other parties from making speeches associating Chief Minister ‘Edappadi’ K. Palaniswami with the 2017 Kodanad heist-cum-murder. His writ petition has been listed for hearing before a Division Bench of Justices S. Manikumar and Subramonium Prasad on Monday. It comes days after City Public Prosecutor Gowri Asokan moved a petition before Justice G.K. Ilanthiraiyan urging the court to directly injunct DMK president M.K. Stalin from linking the Chief Minister’s name with the Kodanad issue. In fact, though Mr. Murugavel’s main prayer in his writ petition was to direct the ECI to dispose of a representation made in this regard by the AIADMK on March 22, he included the DMK as well as Mr. Stalin as respondents and sought an interim prayer to restrain them from making public speeches associating the AIADMK or its leaders with the Kodanad crime. Filing a detailed affidavit in support of his writ petition, the party spokesperson, also a former MLA, said the model code of conduct released by the ECI defined ‘false statement’ to mean any accusation of personal character aimed at prejudicing the prospects of a particular candidate. Further, a general advisory issued by the ECI to political parties specifically stated that during elections, criticism of other political parties and candidates should be restricted to their policies, programmes, past records and work. The advisory also prohibits criticism of other parties or their workers on the basis of unverified allegations or on distortions, he said. Asserting that the allegations made by Mr. Stalin associating the Chief Minister with the Kodanad heist-cum-murder were completely baseless, he recalled that the High Court had injuncted New Delhi-based journalist Mathew Samuel and a few others, who had made the allegations at the first instance through a video release early this year, from continuing with their tirade. When such was the case, the petitioner wondered how the DMK leader alone could be allowed to go on repeating the same allegations during his election campaign. Though a specific complaint was made in this regard to the ECI on the AIADMK letter pad on March 22, no action had been taken so far against the DMK and its leader, the petitioner claimed.

Seized Rs. 14,000 crore assets of an offender: PM|New Delhi|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Without naming absconding liquor baron Vijay Mallya, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said the government had seized Rs. 14,000 crore worth of assets of “a man who committed a Rs. 9,000-crore fraud and left the country”. Mr. Mallya tweeted soon, asking why the BJP leaders were still targeting him though “the highest authority has confirmed full recovery” of his dues and more. “What is the situation of those who committed fraud in India and fled abroad,” Mr. Modi said at the TV9 Bharatvarsh Conclave. “The man who committed a Rs. 9,000-crore fraud and left the country, his Rs. 14,000 crore and more of assets have been confiscated,” he said. Tackling fugitives “How was this possible?” Mr. Modi asked. “Because our government brought in a law that said that if anybody committed such a fraud, not only would all his assets in India be seized, but also all their assets abroad would be auctioned.” Mr. Mallya became the first person to be officially designated a fugitive economic offender by the special court assigned for the purpose under the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act 2018. Under the Act, the government can seize all the domestic and foreign assets of anyone designated a fugitive economic offender. ‘Why this rhetoric?’ Mr. Mallya tweeted: “Saw PM Modi’s interview in which he takes my name and says that even though I owe Rs 9,000 crores to Banks, his Govt has attached my assets worth Rs 14,000 crores. So the highest authority has confirmed full recovery. Why do BJP spokesmen continue their rhetoric?” “I humbly submit that my assertion that I am a poster boy is fully vindicated by the PM’s own statement about me (by name) that his Govt has recovered more than what I allegedly owe the Banks,” Mr. Mallya further tweeted. “Fact that I have been a UK resident since 1992 ignored. Suits the BJP to say I ran away.”  How was this possible? Because our government brought in a law to confiscate assets in India as well as those abroad

Going back to the salt pans of Mumbai|Mumbai|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|It’s 89 years since the famous salt satyagraha led by Mahatma Gandhi, who marched 241 miles to Dandi along with 80 people to break the salt law imposed by the British. In Mumbai, a group of enthusiasts recently relived a part of history by participating in a salt pan walk at Wadala organised by the Asiatic Society of Mumbai. “Mumbai was always known for its salt pans. From Shivaji Maharaj to the British, everyone had interest in this region because of its salt pans,” Vinayak Parab, a member of the Mumbai Research Centre of the Asiatic Society, who led the walk, said. Mr. Parab has been researching salt pans for the past six years. The city’s salt pans are spread from Wadala to Mahul, Kanjurmarg to Vikhroli and Goregaon to Bhayander. On the eastern side, the British had built a narrow-gauge railway between Mahul and Wadala and from Vikhroli towards Thane to collect and transport salt. Remains of these tracks are visible in some places. During Gandhi’s salt satyagraha in 1930, many locations in Mumbai witnessed the civil disobedience movement, but the satyagraha at Wadala salt pan was the most prominent. Thousands of satyagrahis would gather at the Wadala salt pans and often face brutal lathi charge. “Salt has a very rich history. It was the first commodity that was traded. It plays an important role in our body. The words salary and soldier have originated from salt. But today, we never look at salt with such importance,” he said. In ancient Rome, soldiers were given money to buy salt, which was expensive but essential, and sometimes even paid in salt. Salt pans, Mr. Parab said, play a significant role in the ecology of the city and an entire culture has evolved around it. “Salt pans have different species of birds and insects thriving on them. They have an enormous water-holding capacity that helps in flood control. The communities that work on salt pans have their own songs revolving around them,” said Mr. Parab. There is a lack of awareness about salt pans, he said. With the government’s plan to use the salt pans for affordable housing projects, they now face a threat of extinction. “I knew about how important salt pans were but there were so many new aspects that were unknown to me. For example, I had no idea that Shivaji Maharaj had fought a battle with the Portuguese to control the salt pans here,” Omkar Salunkhe, a history teacher from Wilson College, who participated in the walk, said.

‘Surgical strikes alone can’t counter terrorism’|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Lt. Gen. D.S. Hooda (retd.), who led the 2016 surgical strikes as the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Army’s Northern Command, elaborates on a vision document on national security that he presented to Congress president Rahul Gandhi, and speaks on the politicisation of the armed forces and the role of surgical strikes as an anti-terror tactic. You have just presented a vision document for the Congress on national security. Can you briefly elaborate on it? There has always been a talk that India needs a national security strategy which will serve as the basis subsequently for other organs of the government and military to be able to come out with their own respective defence policies and doctrines. We do not have a written strategy. So I was asked by Congress president Rahul Gandhi if I could write a document suggesting what the national security strategy should be. And having written it, I think they intend putting it in the public domain so that there is some debate and discussion and then it can be formalised by whichever government is in power. I have structured it in the format that there are five pillars of national security strategy that we need to focus on. First of these is how India stands in global affairs. What should India’s place be in national affairs and how should we have relationships with major powers and so on. Second is having a secure region — how are our dealings, not only with Pakistan and China, but with other regional neighbours and how can our cooperation grow? The third pillar is resolving our internal conflicts. For that I suggested some strategies to deal with Jammu and Kashmir, the northeast, Left-wing extremism and also international terrorism. The fourth pillar of the strategy is protecting the people. End of the day, it is the people who are at the heart of national security and we need to provide them an environment in which they are safe, secure and prosperous. The last one is if we want to achieve all this, it will only happen if we build up our capabilities. In this I am talking of border management posture, military capability, indigenisation, restructuring of police, cyber, nuclear, space and also our strategic communication capabilities. The 2019 election seems centred on nationalism, especially after the Pulwama attack and Balakot air strike. How healthy is such politicisation for the armed forces? We can’t ignore the fact that there are huge national security challenges and so this is an area that needs to be addressed. You can’t ignore it if you keep having incidents like Pulwama. There will be a response and therefore, national security is an important part. But, I think, along with that we should not look at national security narrowly from the spectrum of Pakistan or terrorism. What does our population want, what are their aspirations and how do we meet them? There are major issues of economy and jobs. Those issues should also be brought to the front. The ruling party has been saying that nobody should ask questions of the armed forces. Are armed forces above accountability? In a democracy, all institutions are accountable. Therefore, taking this very narrow view point that you must not question the services, is not correct. Having said that, also it doesn’t mean you question everything. I think we need to strike a balance in this. We had cross border strikes in 2016 and now Balakot strikes... is this a permanent measure to stall the terrorists? I don’t think a single incident is going to stop Pakistan. Therefore, I have always believed that we need a consistent and long-term strategy which combines all elements of national power, diplomacy, economic pressure, political pressure and where required, military pressure. We should not expect anything to happen in short term, because we have this long festering problem with Pakistan. Rather than attempting to portray single events as game changers, we need a long-term policy. What are your observations on our Kashmir policy of the last couple of years? Whichever way we look at it, violence has gone up everywhere whether you look at security forces or civilian casualties. There is an increase in local recruitment. There is a growing sense of alienation.  In a democracy, all institutions are accountable... Having said that, it doesn’t mean you question everything

‘Cong. won’t allow division of India’|Vijayawada|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Congress not allow the division of India on the lines of caste or religion and will also not allow anyone to loot the country, AICC president Rahul Gandhi said here on Sunday. At an election meeting at the Makineni Basavapunnaiah Municipal Corporation Stadium, Mr. Gandhi charged Prime Minister Narendra Modi with “dividing and stealing” from India. Mr. Modi’s ultimate goal was the destruction of the Constitution but the Congress would not allow it, he said. He said the Congress would eradicate poverty if it came to power and if it was brought to power in Andhra Pradesh all the loans of farmers would be waived in just two days. He said the party was committed to the implementation of the Special Category Status (SCS) and it would be one of the first things to be granted. Citing the case of Rohith Vemula, he said the SC,ST Atrocities Act had been completely diluted. Dalits, minorities, farmers and the weaker sections all had an equal right to live and the Congress would protect them, he said. NYAY scheme Mr. Gandhi said the NYAY scheme would eradicate poverty. All persons with an annual income of Rs. 12,000 or less would be identified using Aadhaar and latest of technology and Rs. 6,000 would be transferred directly into their accounts every month. That would work out to Rs. 3.5 lakh in five years. Mr. Modi lied saying he would transfer Rs. 15 lakh into their accounts, but he was not, he said.Irrigation sector had been grossly neglected in the Rayalaseema region leading to drastic fall in the cultivable area with groundnut and tamarind farmers being the worst affected, said Mr. Gandhi at Kalyandurg in Anantapur district. Kalyandurg party candidate Raghuveera Reddy translated the speech into Telugu. (With inputs from Anantapur Special Correspondent)

Release list of convicted officials, CIC orders Customs Department|New Delhi|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Central Information Commission (CIC) has directed the Customs Department to make public a list of officers caught red-handed smuggling gold and heroin, and for other illegal activities. The CIC also called for making public the details of officers convicted or jailed for giving false statements or evidence. Such data cannot be considered personal information, as held by the Customs Department, and should be made available in the public interest, the CIC said. RTI question The direction came in response to a Right To Information request to the Chief Commissioner of Customs in Amritsar, asking for information on officers caught, convicted or jailed for smuggling over the last 10 years. The Central Public Information Officer (CPIO) responded by saying that the data requested “pertained to personal information of employees,” and hence could not be provided. In response to questioning in the appeal case, the CPIO also said no such list of convicted officers was maintained by the Department.

Lynching accused seen at BJP rally|NEW DELHI|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The accused in the Dadri lynching case were seen sitting in the front row of a BJP rally addressed by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath at Bishahra in the Dadri area on Sunday. Mr. Adityanath was campaigning for Union Minister and BJP candidate Mahesh Sharma, who is contesting from Gautam Budh Nagar in Uttar Pradesh. On September 28, 2015, Mohammad Akhlaq, 50. was lynched at Bishahra for allegedly eating beef during Id and storing it for later consumption. ‘Falsely implicated’ Vishal Singh, one of the prime accused in the case, who was seen sitting in the front with other accused in the case, said they had been falsely implicated in the case. He also said “nothing will happen now” since they are out on bail, he said. In the chargesheet filed by the police, Vishal Singh was accused of making an announcement from a local temple that Akhlaq had consumed beef and was storing it in his house. All 17 accused in the case are out on bail. Addressing a rally at a ground in the village, Mr. Adityanath said everyone now knew what happened in Bishahra. “How shamelessly the Samajwadi government suppressed the emotions of the villagers. I can proudly say that after the BJP formed the government in U.P., we immediately ordered a shutdown of all unauthorised slaughterhouses in the State.” He said Bishahra actually never happened. “People in western U.P. are living a peaceful life under BJP rule because impossible is now possible because of Modi,” he said. Promises more jobs Mr. Adityanath appealed to Bishahra voters to vote for Mr. Sharma because being a Union Minister of State for Tourism and Culture, he had developed temples all over the country and helped establish Hindu culture. “After the Jewar airport gets operational, western U.P. will get one lakh jobs,” he said. He said the Congress ruled the country for the most number of years post-Independence. The Samajwadi and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) ruled U.P. several times but they focussed on “development” of their family members. But after Narendra Modi took over on May 26, 2014 as PM, the “political dynamics changed forever”. Bishahra is a Rajput-dominated village with around 3,000 votes.

State shifts to new health insurance plan|Thiruvananthapuram|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Ten years after the smooth implementation of Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY), on Monday, Kerala will move to a new health insurance programme, Karunya Arogya Suraksha Paddhati (KASP), which will offer an enhanced health coverage of Rs. 5 lakh to the entire beneficiary family. Despite the uncertainties over the change-over, that too on a new IT platform, the 40.96 lakh beneficiary families currently enrolled under RSBY and the 600-odd empanelled public and private service providers (hospitals) are expected to make a seamless transfer to the new scheme, KASP, in phases. KASP is Kerala’s new integrated health protection scheme, a merger of various health financing schemes in the State, including Karunya as well as Centre’s Ayushman Bharat-Prime Minister’s Jan Arogya Yojana. No disruption in access Even though there were apprehensions that the launch of KASP might be delayed and that treatment may be denied to erstwhile beneficiaries of RSBY, Comprehensive Health Insurance Agency of Kerala (CHIAK), the State health authority implementing the scheme, has clarified that all beneficiaries reporting to empanelled hospitals will have access to treatment. The officials were not explicit about the arrangements as the Election Commission’s clearance for the launch of the new scheme has not yet been formally received. However, it is learnt that arrangements had been made in the empanelled hospitals itself for the enrolment and issue of new KASP beneficiary cards to all former RSBY beneficiaries from Monday. “On April 1, no current RSBY cardholder will be denied access to care at any empanelled hospital. However, since biometric identification has been done away with, to access treatment, beneficiaries will have to bring along their Aadhaar card,” senior CHIAK officials said. Enrolment camps This will be a temporary arrangement to ensure that no one is denied access to care. Once the general elections are over, enrolment camps would be conducted for RSBY beneficiaries to move over to KASP. Meanwhile, sources said that much of the delay in preparedness for KASP has been because of the Health Department’s insistence on integrating the Unique Health Identification Number (UHID) generated for citizens under the e-health programme with the KASP software. “The National Health Authority, which is providing the software, later said that UHID cannot be integrated with its software. Moreover, in these past five years of e-health, only two lakh UHIDs have been created in Kerala while we are talking about enrolling two crore people into the new insurance programme. We will capture demographic details for KASP enrolment from the Aadhaar server as was done earlier,” a senior official said.  No current RSBY cardholder will be denied access to care at any empanelled hospital.  Smooth transition KASP offers an enhanced health coverage of Rs. 5 lakh for the entire beneficiary family Seamless transfer expected for 40.96 lakh families under RSBY 281 govt. hospitals and 300 private hospitals will migrate to new system

Remove Modi, save the nation: Mamata|VISAKHAPATNAM|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Reciting the famous song written by Bismil Azimabadi and immortalised by freedom fighters Ram Prasad Bismil and Bhagat Singh ‘Sarfaroshi Ki Tamanna Ab Hamare Dil Mein Hai, Dehkna Hai Zor Kitna Baajuen Qaatil Mein’, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee challenged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to an open debate. At an election rally here on Sunday organised by the TDP, she gave the war cry ‘Modi Hatao-Desh ko Bachao’ (remove Modi-save country). Ms. Banerjee termed the election as an important one as people had to exercise their franchise judiciously to oust the Modi-Amit Shah combine. Getting into the arithmetic of seats in the Lok Sabha, she said that in 2014, the BJP could get 282 of the 543 seats and if they could garner 120 plus seats now it would be quite an achievement. “Combining the four southern States, Odisha and West Bengal there are about 191 seats and in 2014 the BJP could get 21, including 17 from Karnataka. Now they have lost the Assembly elections in Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. So how do they expect to get that many number? In 2014, they garnered 71 of the 80 seats from U.P. but this time, the BSP-SP combine will oust them out. So my calculation of 120 seats stands good,” she said. Earlier, speaking in Telugu, paying tributes to local freedom fighters such as Alluri Seetharamaraju and Tenneti Viswanadham and offering prayers to all local deities, she said Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu should be given one more term. ‘Constitution under threat’ Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the Modi-Shah combine had weakened the foundation of democracy and if not voted out, the Constitution would be under threat. Comparing Mr. Modi’s rule with that of Hitler, he said, “Hitler changed the Constitution and disbanded elections and BJP’s Sakshi Maharaj, in an interview about a week ago, said if Modi and BJP come to power in 2019, there shall be no election till 2050.” Mr. Kejriwal said the five-year BJP rule had divided the country in a number of ways and the very essence of living together in harmony was lost.

Left unhappy as Congress says Rahul will contest Wayanad too|New Delhi|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Left parties questioned the Congress’s commitment to fight the BJP after Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Sunday chose Kerala’s Wayanad as his second seat, where the CPI is in the fray as part of the Left Democratic Front (LDF). The BJP mocked the Congress. Its president Amit Shah said Mr. Gandhi had fled from Amethi to escape accountability. “Rahul Gandhi has fled to Kerala as he fears the Amethi voters will seek an account [of work] from him,” he said at a rally in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh. The Congress named Mr. Gandhi on its first list as its candidate for Amethi in Uttar Pradesh. And then came the demand from the party units in Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu that he contest from these States too. “We conveyed to Rahulji that it would not be correct to ignore the sentiments of Congress workers from the southern States,” said senior leader A.K. Antony, who announced the decision. Wayanad was chosen, he said, because it is on the junction of the three States. Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the choice of Wayanad was not of political convenience. “Why did Narendra Modi leave Gujarat to contest from Varanasi? Was he in a weak position in Gujarat? These are immature comments,” he said. The Left parties were cut to the quick and asked the Congress to spell out whether its primary target in this election was the BJP or the Left. “The decision to field Mr. Gandhi from Wayanad goes against their [the Congress’s] stated commitment to fight the BJP because in Kerala the LDF is the main force against the BJP, and now they [the Congress] are contesting against the Left. The Congress has lost the plot somewhere,” the former CPI(M) general secretary, Prakash Karat, said. The Left would firmly fight Mr. Gandhi and the Congress-led UDF in the State, he said.

For the first time, Congress president Rahul Gandhi and JD(S) supremo H.D. Deve Gowda held a rally and launched a joint campaign seeking votes for the ruling alliance candidates.

Congress, BJP campaigning intensifies in Mysuru|MYSURU|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Congress candidate C.H.

He launched the campaign from K.R. Mohalla in the city and was accompanied by local party leaders including N.K. Somashekar and others. However, JD(S) leader in the district G.T. Deve Gowda continued to be conspicuous by absence. Mr. Vijayashankar said that the unity of the coalition partners was inevitable in the interest of the country. He told mediapersons that the coalition government in the State had to continue in power and more importantly, the same spirit of coalition and cooperation was what would help bring them to power at the Centre and dislodge the NDA government. “It is inevitable to stay united in the interest of the country. Minor differences will be ironed out given the larger issues at stake,” said Mr. Vijayashankar. Earlier in the day, he met JD(S) supremo and former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda in Bengaluru. He claimed that the former assured him of full cooperation. “Mr. Deve Gowda blessed me today and has assured intensive campaigning with other leaders of his party in the days ahead in both Mysuru and Kodagu regions to ensure the victory of the coalition partners,” said Mr. Vijayashankar. He latter visited a local temple in K.R. Mohalla before going on a road show. Meanwhile, the BJP bandwagon continued to roll in Mysuru and the party leaders held a ‘Sneha Milan’ with IT-BT professionals to woo the young crowd and first-time voters. “Apart from a mass contact programme through public rallies, we are focussing on outreach programmes to reach out to specific audience and explain to them why they should vote for the BJP,” a party functionary said.

Hike in airport road toll from today|Bengaluru|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Those travelling between the city and Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) will have to shell out more for using National Highway 44 as the NHAI has increased the toll collected at Sadahalli plaza to Rs. 90 for cars — up by Rs. 5 — for single trip.

‘Central PSU employees are upset with NDA govt.’|Bengalu|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Rural Development MinisterKrishna Byre Gowda, five-time MLA, is the Congress candidate for Bengaluru North Lok Sabha constituency. He is fighting the elections against Union Minister and former Chief Minister D.V. Sadananda Gowda of the Bharatiya Janata Party. During an interaction, he said there were several plus points for him in the constituency.Though he said it was difficult to judge the undercurrent among the electorate, he pointed out thata good number of Central public sector unit (PSU) voters in the constituency were against the Union government.Excerpts from the interaction. What are the plus and minus points for you in the constituency? There are several plus points this time. We have seven MLAs [of both the Congress and the Janata Dal-Secular] and have good strength in the constituency. Our coordination is good and differences among us is zero. Secondly, I am in the north constituency for the last 10 years and people know me very well.Our opponent is good, but he has not taken much interest in the constituency. Being an MP, he had not shown any interest in local issues. The BJP MP’s involvement in the constituency is negligible. The BJP’s only plus point is the Modi factor. We have to overcome that. What is your sense of the mood of the electorate? It is difficult to judge the undercurrent among the electorate in the country. The voters have their own sense in this country; you can call it common sense or intelligence, but it’s not visible and they are not articulating it too. Did anyone predict Indira Gandhi’s defeat in the 1977 general elections? Who predicted the BJP’s defeat in the 2004 parliamentary elections? Are you interested in going to national politics? I strongly believe that a politician can become a full-fledged or mature public figure only if he works at the national level. I believe that one stint in Delhi is a must for a serious politician. Do you think the present time is good to enter national politics? It will be a good experience if the party comes to power at the Centre. Otherwise, it’s another good experience being in the Opposition. It’s always better to start a political career as an Opposition MLA or MP. I learnt a lot from the 2009 general elections. Do you see a change in electoral behaviour now? There was not much bitterness among voters in 2009. But now, voters fiercely argue and contest our viewpoints. How do you understand the electorate in your constituency? It is a mix. Middle-class voters are predominant in Malleswaram, Hebbal, R.T. Nagar, Mahalakshmi Layout, and Byatarayanapura. There are a good number of Central public sector unit (PSU) voters here. Employees of BEL, HAL, HMT, and ITI to some extent are opposing the Union government this time. BEL employees had given me a lead in the Assembly elections. HAL employees are fully against the Central government; HMT staff are also not happy. The Centre decided to close down HMT, so obviously they are sad. So, Central PSU employees are upset with the NDA government.  There was not much bitterness among voters in 2009. But now, voters fiercely argue and contest our viewpoints.

Ramesh Katti for Cong.?|Belagavi|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Speculations are rife that Ramesh Katti, former MP, who has been denied ticket by the BJP to contest from Chikkodi, is approaching the Congress to contest the Lok Sabha polls. The BJP leaders have chosen Anna Saheb Jolle, husband of Shashikala Jolle, Nippani MLA, to be the party nominee. Supporters of the Katti brothers allege that the BJP has betrayed them and they will quit the party to find political future elsewhere. They point towards the fact that Prakash Hukkeri, incumbent MP from Chikkodi, is yet to file his nomination from the party. It is a signal that Mr. Katti may move to the Congress, they claim. According to them, Mr. Hukkeri may fight from Belagavi and the Congress high command will convince V.S. Sadhunavar, the party candidate who has filed his nominations from Belagavi, to withdraw. However, none of the parties concerned, including the Katti brothers and Mr. Hukkeri, have confirmed this. Mr. Hukkeri said he will file his nomination papers from Chikkodi before April 4 and that he has invited Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy and former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah. “An honourable alternative would be to remain away from campaigning and limit their political activities to their constituency of Hukkeri Assembly seat. But the Katti brothers are not the ones who keep quiet,” said a BJP leader in charge of poll campaign. “The party is trying to talk to the Katti brothers. We have been able to speak to Umesh Katti, but Mr. Ramesh is not reachable,” the leader said. Another leader said BJP State president B.S. Yeddyurappa was likely to fly to Belagavi on Monday to speak to Mr. Umesh. On Sunday, a breakfast meeting of BJP leaders with Mr. Umesh to placate him did not seem to have achieved the desired objective. According to party sources, Mr. Umesh told the leaders that he would have respected the BJP’s decision if it had been conveyed to him earlier. Suresh Angadi, MP, Abhay Patil, MLA, and R.S. Mutalik, BJP leader, were part of the delegation that met Mr. Umesh.

Suresh Angadi holds meetings in Belagavi|Belagavi|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Suresh Angadi, MP and Bharatiya Janata Party candidate from Belagavi, held a series of meetings in different localities in Belagavi on Sunday, as part of his poll campaign. He stopped for tea in Raghavendra Colony and Chidambar Nagar, which are part of Belagavi South Assembly constituency. He told the residents that the achievements of the NDA government at the Centre were unprecedented. He appealed to voters to consider his individual achievements as well when deciding on whom to vote for in the parliamentary polls. “I have brought out a pamphlet on my contributions to the development of Belagavi in the past 15 years,” he said at the meeting in Chidambar Nagar. He said the 10% reservation for economically backward communities would help communities such as Brahmins and others. Abhay Patil, MLA, noted that no leader from Belagavi has been a Union Minister since Babagouda Patil. He expressed hope that Mr. Angadi would become a Minister in a NDA Cabinet in the coming years. Mr. Angadi’s teacher N.V. Joshi recalled his student years at RL Law college and expressed hope that Mr. Angadi became the Law Minister. Party leaders R.S. Mutalik and Aruna Naik were among those present.

Vertical gardens proposed to make up for loss of green cover|Bengaluru|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The coalition government’s ambitious elevated corridor project will see as many as 3,716 trees being axed. Among the measures mentioned in the environmental impact assessment report for making up for the loss of green cover is the creation of vertical gardens. The proposed project has been criticised from environmentalists and sections of citizens for the impact it will have on tree-lined avenues of the city. They have also alleged that the project will only promote use of private vehicles. The report, prepared by Karnataka Road Development Corporation Ltd. (KRDCL) as part the final feasibility report, states that the 102-km elevated corridor will have 2,751 pillars with a total area of 64,820 sq. m. Vertical gardens will not only increase greenery along the corridor, but will also help absorb air pollutants and dust, thus reducing the impact of obnoxious gases significantly, it states. The report identifies “sensitive wooded stretches” in the city which will get affected, such as Cubbon Park/Kasturba Road, Palace Grounds/Jayamahal Road, IISc. campus to Mehkri Circle, C.V. Raman Road, and others. Over 850 trees will either get axed or be trimmed on these stretches. To compensate for the loss, the report states that trees cleared shall be replaced with a minimum of 10 trees per tree cut or according to the Compensatory Afforestation Policy under the Forest Conservation Act 1980. The report also talks about transplanting around 600 trees. “Vertical gardens will be proposed on the pillars of the elevated corridor, similar to vertical gardens developed by Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation near Rangoli Art Centre next to M.G. Road metro station using hydroponics technology,” states the report. However, the BMRCL, which had taken up the work on a pilot basis, is yet to replicate it elsewhere.

‘Mandya DC should seek transfer if she’s under any pressure’|Mandya|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Close on the heels of the transfer of Hassan Deputy Commissioner, BJP-backed Independent candidate in Mandya, Sumalatha, on Sunday accused Mandya District Election Officer (DEO) N. Manjushri of being biased. She said that the DEO, who is also the Deputy Commissioner, should voluntarily seek transfer if she is unable to discharge her duties transparently due to any pressure. Addressing a press conference, Ms. Sumalatha, who is taking on JD(S) candidate K. Nikhil, reiterated her allegation that Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy was misusing the DEO’s office. She expressed fear that the elections may not be held in a free and fair manner in Mandya if strict measures were not taken by the Election Commission (EC). The veteran actor said she has written to the EC urging it to declare Mandya constituency as “sensitive’ and provide additional security to all 2,047 polling stations. She raised objections about Mr. Nikhil’s nomination filing process and said that electricity and cable network connections were disrupted when she filed her papers. However, the Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply Corporation was instructed by the Mandya Superintendent of Police to provide uninterrupted power supply on March 25 when Mr. Nikhil filed his papers, she alleged. According to her, Mr. Kumaraswamy had knowledge about his son getting serial number one in the EVM even before the EC announced it, and he had mentioned it in his speech on March 25. Conspiracy alleged Meanwhile, the Mandya district unit of the JD(S) strongly defended Ms. Manjushri. JD(S) Mandya district unit president Ramesh alleged that Ms. Sumalatha was conspiring for the transfer of Ms. Manjushri in a bid to bring an officer who is close to her for political gains.

JD(S)-Congress leaders train their guns on Modi|Bengaluru|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The joint election rally of the Janata Dal (Secular)-Congress held here on Sunday saw leaders attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi on various fronts. While Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy accused Mr. Modi of ignoring the State’s interests, Congress president Rahul Gandhi took on the Prime Minister over national issues, including corruption, unemployment and demonetisation among others. Appealing to the voters not to get swayed by the glib talk of the Prime Minister, Mr. Kumaraswamy accused the Centre of not notifying the Mahadayi tribunal’s award. “So far, the gazette notification of the Mahadayi tribunal award has not been done despite the State informing it’s readiness to implement it to distribute water in North Karnataka. Similarly, I have met Mr. Modi regarding utilisation of the Krishna waters, but the BJP has not done anything for Karnataka,” he alleged. He said: “Mr. Modi has cheated the State. He lies whenever he speaks. Only six farmers have received first instalment under the PM Kisan scheme in Karnataka though the government has sent a list of 10 lakh beneficiaries.” Accusing the Prime Minister of helping 15 to 20 capitalist friends, Mr. Gandhi said that poor farmers, workers, labourers and traders have been ignored. “While Nirav Modi, Vijay Mallya, Mehul Choksi, and Anil Ambani got money, the Centre did not have money for poor farmers, government schools, and hospitals. States such as Karnataka, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh could waive off loans. Where did they get money from? There is no shortage of money.” He said: “If Mr. Modi can give money to the rich, Congress can give money to the poor and farmers. We will do what we can. Do whatever you [NDA government] want to do.” Stating that the Congress will do a surgical strike on poverty, he said that within five years the party will ensure minimum income of Rs. 12,000 to every family. “ Under Nyay, five crore families and 25 crore people will benefit as 20% of the families will receive Rs. 72,000 per annum.” Youth, he said, did not benefit from the Modi government as only 15 to 20 of his [Mr. Modi’s] friends benefited. “Congress will allow youth to set up business without permission for three years. Employment creators will receive help from the government. Congress will unite the country that has been divided by BJP,” he said.

Workshop discusses suicide, preventive steps|KALABURAGI|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|K.S. Vijaya, Fifth Additional District and Sessions Judge, said that under section 309 of Indian Penal Code an attempt to commit suicide is punishable with simple imprisonment up to one year and or a fine, but suicide is the only crime where commission is not punishable.

Mallikarjun Nagrale, First Additional District and Sessions Judge, said that the present generation is more impatient. It cannot accept defeat or take failure in its stride and goes into depression.

Now, get skilled labourers through an app in Kottayam|KOTTAYAM|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The residents of Manarcaud in Kottayam can now take care of their routine household services with the touch of a finger. For this, all they need is a smartphone equipped with the ‘Thozhilidam App’. The National Service Scheme unit at the St.Mary’s college, Manarcaud has developed a real-time instant app to supply labour and service on demand. The free mobile app being developed with a technical support of a Kochi-cased IT firm, covers about 30 services as different as from rubber tapping to carpentry, painting and even palliative care services. To begin with, the app has listed the details of about 400 skilled workers, as identified by the NSS volunteers of the college, for the customers to sift through and choose. Each worker joining the app will have to undergo background and reference checks and sign an MOU, to make sure that they live up to the objective of offering credible service with out rip-offs. Plans are also afoot to give a fundamental behavioural training to the labourers registering with the app to ensure a smooth delivery of services. The idea of the mobile app, according to Tony Francis, NSS programme officer, follows the huge demand for skilled workers and the thought for leveraging technological advancement to the benefit of the unorganised labourers. Considering the reach of smartphones among all sections of the society, they finally zeroed in on an app-based solution to streamline the unregulated sector, which typically do not have employment contracts or structured methods of finding employment. “The app has two main components- customer and worker. While the client can select the labourer based on GPS location and rating of employees, a message is sent to the person concerned, who may respond to it based on availability, ” he explained. Scale up In addition to expanding the list of services it offers, the app also looks to scale up and expand its customer base. Its creators are now in consultations with the MGU, which has evinced interest in expanding the scope of the project to a vast area including the Kottayam Town. A trial version of the app is already available in Google play store.

Rivals slam Jigajinagi for using Modi’s name to seek votes|Vijayapura|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|MP and BJP candidate Ramesh Jigajinagi appears to have handed ammunition to his opposition by appealing to voters to vote, not by looking at him but at Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The opposition, mainly the JD(S) which has fielded a candidate in the district, is now using the statement to drive home the message that Mr. Jigajinagi had already conceded defeat, which was why was asking for votes in Mr. Modi’s name instead of his own work. On many occasions, Mr. Jigajinagi has told voters that as Mr. Modi has been “instrumental in developing the nation”, they should vote for the BJP, regardless of its candidate in the constituency. At several press conferences as well, he has said that people should vote by looking at Mr. Modi and his work, not at him. “By making such statements, he is effectively admitting that he has done nothing for the development of the district even in 10 years of his tenure as MP. Since he has failed at his job, he is bringing in Modi’s name to excuse his failures,” said Devanand Chavan, JD(S) MLA whose wife, Sunita Chavan, has been fielded as the coalition candidate in Vijayapura constituency. He challenged the MP to list out the development works started by him during his tenure. Ms. Sunita said at a press conference on Saturday, “The fact is that the MP has just nothing to say on development as he has done nothing. Except for making hollow promises, his contribution to the district is zero. That is why he is asking people to vote by looking at Modi.” The JD(S) is, however, hopeful of getting the people’s vote as they will not be “misled” by the emotional statements of Mr. Jigajinagi.

Thus, the initial disappointment after being denied ticket would not be taken into consideration while working the party’s success,” the former MLA said and added that he believed in the party’s principles and would adhere to them.

1,130 properties to be affected by elevated corridor|Bengaluru|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The proposed elevated corridor, which will criss cross the city through 102 km, will affect as many as 1,131 properties and require a total of 56.89 hectares of land, according to the environmental impact assessment report prepared by Karnataka Road Development Corporation Ltd. (KRDCL) as part the final feasibility report on the much-hyped project. The report, which was made public recently, states that the identified properties include 209 residential, 577 commercial, and 32 religious structures. The KRDCL will be spending Rs. 11,555 crore to acquire the properties. As per the report, of the 56.89 ha of land needed for the project, 17.76 ha is owned by private parties. Apart from this, 33.52 ha of land owned by the State government, 2.54 ha of defence land, and 3.07 ha of land owned by the Union government will be needed for the project. The State government has given its approval to take up the project in four phases and tenders have been floated for building the 22-km north-south corridor from Baptist Hospital to Silk Board.  The alignment of the elevated corridors will be for two/four/six lanes, depending on the requirement and the availability of space. The width may vary from 18 m to 62 m.

Bhovi community to vote for party clarifying stand on Sadashiva panel report|Chitradurga|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|At a meeting of Bhovi community leaders held under the leadership of Immadi Siddarameshwar Swami of Bhovi Gurupeet on Sunday, it was decided that the community would support in the Lok Sabha elections the party that clarifies its stand on the Sadashiva Commission report. Immadi Siddarameshwar Swami said the Bhovi community had initially decided to opt of NOTA because of the “negligent attitude” of the BJP in issuing ticket to a candidate from the community, despite repeated appeals. “After discussions and collecting the opinion of people from the community, the leaders have decided not to opt for NOTA and instead vote in favour of the party that clarifies its stand on the report,” he said. As the SVEEP committee formed to create awareness among voters on compulsory voting is making all efforts to ensure that the district records 100% voting, it would not be fair to appeal to Bhovi voters to abstain from voting, he said. Community leader Anandappa opined that it would not fair to blame the political parties for not announcing ticket to the community. Instead, the community should concentrate on the advantages it can get for the overall development of its people. People from the community should stand united and ensure that everyone gets facilities for social and economic development, he said.

Close to two historical structures|Bengaluru|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST| The KRDCL will have to obtain permission of the Archaeological Survey of India prior to taking up one of the lines of east-west corridor (from Varthur to Mysuru Road at Sirsi Circle).

Corridors of Power|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST| The family of H.D. Deve Gowda is known for its faith in numerology, astrology, and so on. But now, A. Manju (in picture), former Congressman who is now the BJP candidate from Hassan, is trying to use the same language. He has been going around saying that “number 9” is unlucky for Mr. Gowda. This is his reasoning: Mr. Gowda lost in the 1989 Assembly elections and in the 1999 Lok Sabha elections, on both occasions to G. Puttaswamy Gowda of the Congress. Now, the Lok Sabha elections are being held in 2019. Moreover, Mr. Manju says that the polling is on April 18 (1 plus 8 is equal to 9). But, Mr. Manju seems to be forgetting that Mr. Gowda won in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections. Meanwhile, Mr. Gowda’s son and Minister for Public Works H.D. Revanna’s tryst with astrology continues. He had his own reason to remain unfazed by the recent Income Tax raids. Mr. Revanna said that his star (Nakshatra) was ‘Swathi’ and no “witchcraft” would affect him. As a double protection, he was blessed by seers of the Sringeri Mutt. “All this will only help JD(S) fight with renewed energy,” he said.  A recent statement by senior Congress leader D.K. Shivakumar (in picture) had leaders and workers of the party puzzled. At a recent party workers’ convention in Sandur to work out a strategy for Lok Sabha polls, Mr. Shivakumar said: “I am the person to carry the corpse as well as the palanquin.” His statement came in response to a question on whether B. Nagendra, Ballari (ST) MLA who had associated with the rebel group in Congress, would remain within the party and work for the victory of party candidate in the Lok Sabha election. The crowd interpreted it in its own way. Some saw it as a warning to Mr. Nagendra and others that he [Shivakumar] was capable of doing good as well as bad. When this interpretation started gaining circulation, Mr. Shivakumar clarified: “I did not mean it in the negative sense but to drive home the point that I am always the handyman for good and bad.” Nagesh Prabhu M. Ahiraj

More statues come up at Urban Tree Park|UDUPI|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|New statues of animals, a wooden walkway and a small water pond are some of the new attractions being constructed at the Salumarada Thimmakka Urban Tree Park located on six acres of land at Yembattu Badagabettu village near Udupi. Among the big statues, on which work is in the final stages, include that of a nine-feet-high elephant, a peacock, Indian roller, two tigers, while a bison, a deer, a bear, a monkey and a wild boar have been sculpted in cement to form a group. The other statues that have been constructed include those of an eight-feet-long nest with a bird sitting on it, a tortoise, a snail, a grasshopper, a chameleon and a termite mound. Sources in the Forest Department said here that the boards besides these statues giving details of these animals are expected to be installed in about a fortnight. A narrow walkway constructed with the help of wood and bamboos in the midst of the park is yet another attraction. A small water pond and percolation pits too have been dug around the park. An animal fun zone for children too has been constructed. A concrete water plate has been constructed and water has been kept in it here for the birds to quench their thirst. The Urban Tree Park inaugurated a year ago is one of the sought-after recreational spots here. It is located just outside the city and is close to the educational hub of Manipal. This park receives about 200 visitors on the weekdays, while it receives about 600 people on the weekends. “We want people to get the feel of a forest even while they relax at the park. Yet another of our objective is to make children aware about the importance of conservation of environment,” said Cliffard Lobo, Range Forest Officer, Udupi Range.

Arsikere MLA booked for poll code violation|Hassan|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Election Commission (EC) has registered a complaint against K.M. Shivalinge Gowda, Arsikere JD(S) MLA, for his alleged statement made in violation of the model code of conduct. H.K. Prabhakar, Labour Inspector and member of the flying squad formed by the EC to keep tab on violation, filed the complaint on March 27. The MLA, in a party workers’ meeting held in Arsikere on March 20, alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had failed to fulfil his promise of bringing back black money and distributing the same among the residents of the country. He allegedly appealed to the workers to assault those who raised slogans praising Mr. Modi. The police have registered the case under Section 171 of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of Representation of the People Act.

Mahagathbandhan agenda has no clarity: Prashant Bhushan|DHARWAD|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The very aspirations of the Constitution will be defeated if Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is re-elected in the upcoming parliamentary elections, senior Supreme Court counsel Prashant Bhushan has said. Inaugurating a conference, Janasankalpa, a people’s movement to protect the Constitution organised by the Citizen for Democracy here on Sunday, Mr. Bhushan said that during its five-year tenure, the Modi government did not miss a single opportunity to weaken democracy and strangulate freedom of speech and expression. If the same government is re-elected, it would only sound the death knell to the democratic and secular fabric of the nation, he said. Mr. Bhushan said that the Modi government has turned Central agencies such as the CBI, the CVC and the CAG into puppets. This government has even rendered the post of the Chief Information Commissioner vacant for long. After repeated appeals made to the Supreme Court and based on its directions, a few posts were filled. Moreover, several key positions in government institutions are occupied either by persons affiliated to the Sangh Parivar or bureaucrats from the Gujarat cadre, he said. Expressing concern overr money power playing a decisive role in deciding the fate of the candidates in the Lok Sabha elections, Mr. Bhushan said that the limit of Rs. 70 lakh per candidate imposed by the Election Commission of India is of no use as it applies only for candidates and not for parties. Moreover, the Modi government has made it easy to procure election funds by amending rules. Now, it is possible for political parties to raise funds even from foreign firms. This apart, corporate lobbies have started buying electoral bonds from banks and donate them to parties, as the names of the donors are not be mentioned in the bonds. So far, electoral bonds worth Rs. 2,000 crore have been purchased from various banks and nearly 96 % of them donated to the BJP, he said. Political parties may spend not less than Rs. 1 lakh crore in this Lok Sabha elections, he said and added that of this, 90 % spending will be made by BJP candidates to retain power. He said that defeating the Modi government in the 2019 general elections is essential to safeguarding the democratic principles and social fabric of India. About the Mahagathbandhan, the grand alliance of the Opposition parities against BJP, Mr. Bhushan said that though they have come together to defeat the BJP, there is no clarity about their agenda. Therefore, people should push forward their agenda and compel the political parties to implement them. Suggesting that some welfare measures need to the implemented by the government, Mr. Bhushan said that the total days of employment under the MGNREGA scheme should be enhanced from 100 to 150 and employment should be provided to all adults. The Right to Education Act should be extended up to 12th standard. Money for such schemes should be mobilised by imposing wealth tax, inheritance tax on the rich, revoking exemptions provided to corporate houses, he added. Citizen for Democracy president S.R. Hiremath and Babu Mathew, expert in Constitutional law, spoke.

The IUML had conveyed its angst to the Congress high command over the delay in deciding the candidate for Wayanad.

‘More youth taking up cleanliness drive is a welcome sign’|MANGALURU|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|It is heartening to see more and more youth getting engaged in Swacch Bharat movement while Mangaluru is becoming cleaner day by day due to the Swatch Mangaluru Abhiyan, Ramya Shetty, professor from SDM College of Business Management, said here on Sunday. She was speaking after flagging off the 17th Shramadan of Swatch Mangaluru Abhiyan Fifth Phase being organised by Mangaluru Ramakrishna Mission at Attavar. Yoga teacher Jagadish Shetty, who also jointly flagged off the drive, said that the abhiyan is waking up people from slumber towards the importance of conserving and preserving nature. He said that everyone should inculcate cleanliness, both internal and external. Volunteers formed different groups after the flagging off. The road leading towards Sarojini Madhusudan Kushe School was cleaned. Heaps of mud lying by the side of the road for years were removed using an earthmover. Dirt and garbage lying there was also removed. Old and unused motor vehicles were removed and the over-grown weeds and grass were cleared. Students from SDM College of Business Management took up cleanliness work at Ananda Shetty Circle. A park used by senior citizens was in a dilapidated condition due to poor management.

A 55-year-old promise that has still remained one|Shivamogga|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|For the last 55 years, residents of five gram panchayats (GPs) in the Sharavati backwater region have been listening to politicians promising them a bridge during the elections. Most families from the Tumari, Kudarur, Sankanna Shanubagh, Channagonda, and Bhankuli gram panchayats ceded their land for the construction of a reservoir across the Sharavati river near Linganamakki in 1964. After the Sharavati hydel power project was commissioned, the villages turned into islands in the Linganamakki reservoir backwaters. Many moved upland when their houses were submerged. Promises of proper rehabilitation were not fulfilled, and the region remained deprived of basic amenities like healthcare and connectivity. Moreover, many villagers don’t have title deeds for the land on which they were rehabilitated. At present, two barges provided by the Department of Ports and Inland Water Transport connect nearly 30,000 people in the five GPs. A long-standing demand of the region is a 2.16-km bridge across the Sharavati backwaters to Kalasavalli and Ambaragodlu villages, which will provide easy access to the mainland. A sharp increase in the number of devotees visiting the Chowdeshwari temple in the Sigandur village has lately resulted in overcrowding of the barges. Sathyanarayan G.T., president, Tumari GP, toldThe Hinduthat local students and patients have been facing difficulty in boarding them. In 2009, the State government gave the nod for the construction of a bridge at an estimated cost of Rs. 164.59 crore. However, the project was pushed to the back-burner as officials of the Finance Department felt it was not economically viable. On 19 February, 2018, Nitin Gadkari, Union Minister for Road Transport, Highways, Shipping and Water Resources, laid the foundation stone for the construction of a bridge. A revised estimate said the bridge would cost Rs. 450 crore. The Ministry floated a tender for a project recently. Today, B.Y. Raghavendra, BJP candidate for the Shivamogga parliamentary seat, is seeking votes claiming that the Centre took up the bridge construction work on the request of B.S. Yeddyurappa, his father and president of the BJP State unit, who was the Shivamogga MP then. Countering this claim, Madhu Bangarappa, JD(S) candidate, is alleging that BJP leaders were trying to mislead voters over the construction of the bridge. In the Lok Sabha elections of 2009 and 2014, and during the Assembly election in 2018, the BJP had tried to garner votes in the name of the bridge construction, he said. Na. D’Souza, Kannada novelist who was also involved in the struggle launched by residents of the island for the construction of the bridge, toldThe Hinduthat it has become a practice for the politicians to seek votes in the name of constructing the bridge, instead of seeing it as a responsibility of the government of the day to provide an essential amenity for the displaced people of the Sharavati hydel project. “With a small portion of the revenue earned from power generation, the bridge can be constructed. It is apparent that all the political parties that have ruled the State so far lacked the will power for the construction of the bridge,” he said. Mr. Sathyanarayan concurred, “In earlier campaign meetings, promises to build the bridge were greeted with huge applause. But people have lost hope now. For politicians, the bridge has become a means to secure votes.”

Vertical gardens can be a solution, says report|Bengaluru|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The coalition government’s ambitious elevated corridor project will see approximately 3,716 trees being axed. Among the compensatory measures mentioned in the environmental impact assessment report for making up for the loss of green cover is creating vertical gardens. The proposed project has come under scathing criticism from environmentalists and sections of citizens for the impact it will have on tree-lined avenues of the city. The report, prepared by Karnataka Road Devel- opment Corporation Ltd. as part the final feasibility report, states that the 102-km elevated corridor has a total of 2,751 pillars, with an area of 64,820 sq.m. Vertical gardens will not only increase the greenery along the corridor, but will also help in absorbing air pollutants and dust, thus reducing the impact of obnoxious gases significantly, it says.

Candidates told to focus on eco-conservation|PATHANAMTHITTA|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Pampa Parirakshana Samiti, a Kozhencherry-based eco-group that has been campaigning for the cause of river Pampa since the past three decades, has called upon the candidates to focus on environment conservation and the climate change in their election campaign. Talking toThe Hindu, N.K.Sukumaran Nair, PPS general secretary, said that the constituency that housed Sabarimala has got a plethora of unresolved environmental issues. The Centrally-sponsored Pampa Action Plan of 2003 that envisaged pollution abatement of river Pampa has lapsed owing to the alleged laxity on the part of the successive State governments. Though the Centre had allotted 250 acres of forest land at Nilackal to the Travancore Devaswom Board for setting up a self-contained base camp for pilgrims way back in 2005, the authorities concerned have failed to imbibe the very spirit of the project, Mr. Nair alleged. Of late, the State Government has taken some positive steps to convert Nilackal into a full-fledged pilgrims’ base camp, by denying entry for private vehicles, beyond Nilackal. The Government move had yielded very good results, he said. The Erumeli canal that meanders through the outskirts of the Sastha Temple at Erumeli, a major transit camp of Sabarimala pilgrims, leading to river Manimala too has been heavily polluted during the Sabarimala pilgrim season. Scientific development Mr Nair said scientific development of pilgrims’ transit camps at Erumeli, Ranni, Vadasserikkara, Aranmula, and Pandalam, should also be included in their development agenda. Mr Nair said it was high time the candidates made environment conservation their main agenda.

Zest is back in UDF camp|KALPETTA/Alappuzha/kottayam|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The United Democratic Front (UDF) camp in the Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency became alive once again on Sunday noon, after 10 days of uncertainty, when Congress leader A.K. Antony announced the candidature of party president Rahul Gandhi from the constituency. The UDF workers celebrated the announcement by bursting firecrackers and distributing sweets. They took out marches even in small towns in the constituency. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said the candidature of Mr. Gandhi would help the Congress bag maximum seats in the southern States. Reacting to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s criticism of the decision, Mr. Chennithala said Mr. Vijayan had started panicking. ‘Challenge accepted’ “At the national level, Congress’s rival is the BJP. But in Kerala our opponent is the CPI(M). A prime ministerial candidate is contesting from the State for the first time. Both, Kerala and Wayanad will become focal points in the polls,” he said. Mr. Chennithala said both the UDF and the Congress had accepted the challenge thrown by the Chief Minister, who said that the LDF would work to defeat Mr. Gandhi in Wayanad. Hailing the decision, KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran said the location of Wayanad at a tri-junction of Kerala, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu, made it the prefect constituency for Mr. Gandhi to contest from. “This sends out a message against the discriminatory stance of the BJP towards south India,” he said.  Request to CPI(M) Asserting that the Congress was the only party capable of taking on the BJP, he urged the CPI(M) to desist from a direct fight against the party in Wayanad. He parried queries on whether Mr. Gandhi would retain the constituency if he won from both Amethi and Wayanad. Kozhikode District Congress Committee president T. Siddique, who was initially the UDF candidate for Wayanad, said the decision of Mr. Gandhi had executed a ‘surgical strike’ on Congress opponents. “All UDF workers would work for his record victory.” I.C. Balakrishnan, MLA, and Wayanad DCC president, said Mr. Gandhi would provide a new impetus to the election campaign of UDF in the entire State.

Vehicular pollution goes unchecked in city|Kozhikode|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Air pollution caused by vehicles is rising sharply in Kozhikode city, making the issuance of Pollution Under Control Certificates (PUC) a meaningless exercise, say road users. Though vehicles, mostly private buses and goods-carriers, carry the PUC certificate, the emission levels mentioned in the certificates or their genuineness are rarely verified by officials. Special squads formed by the Motor Vehicles Department and the traffic police for checking traffic rule violations are yet to focus on the violation of emission norms. The squads have a limited number of Portable Emissions Measurement System (PEMS) to check emission levels on the spot. An integrated online verification system earlier planned by the State government to track the use of fake PUC certificates using QR code verification too is remaining on paper. Figures available with the Kerala State Council for Science, Technology, and Environment say three cities — Ernakulam, Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode — have 40% of the total registered vehicles in the State. Automobile emission and noise from the three cities are severe in nature and lead to serious air quality deterioration. Faulty engine Experts in the automobile sector say the high emission of black smoke or carbon monoxide is the first indication of a faulty engine, which can be addressed only by timely service. However, it may be an expensive work in the case of older vehicles. Though representatives of various organisations and travellers’ forums have taken up the issue with district-level authorities several times citing health hazards, no action has been taken yet. Tourist taxi operators say they regularly spot a number of such vehicles in the city. “On the Kozhikode-Kannur national highway itself, one can spot the movement of a number of goods carriers with high emission of black smoke. Strangely, all such vehicles manage to reach their destinations without any trouble during their inter-district journey,” says Sanoop, a tourist taxi operator. Meanwhile, MVD officials say the public can easily assist the checking squads by providing the details of such polluting vehicles through the WhatsApp helpline:- 8281786094. They say a rechecking or verification of the already issued PUC certificate from the agencies can be done on noticing genuine complaints. Now, five checking squads are in action covering the national highways as part of a special checking drive and they will be responding quickly to such complaints, they add.

Kochi metro to rely more on solar power|KOCHI|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) is set to source 40% of its power requirements from solar energy, for which it will commission a 2,719-kW capacity solar farm located on the marshy land abutting the metro coach maintenance yard at Muttom on Monday. The new solar panels have been placed in an area of four hectares adjacent to the yard. For over a year, the metro agency has been sourcing another 2,719 kW of power from solar panels kept atop 13 metro stations and at the yard. Plans are afoot to install more solar panels at stations, especially over test tracks. The combined 5,438-kW power will result in the KMRL relying 10% less on power supplied from the KSEB sub stations at Kalamassery and Kaloor. Efforts are under way to enhance the reliance on solar power to 60% by 2020. At present, KMRL produces 5,389 kW electricity from its plant at Muttom and the solar panels erected over 13 metro stations. KMRL also has plans to source power from a solar farm for the fleet of 78 ferries that will be procured for the Water Metro project.

‘Main Bhi Chowkidar’ slogan will be continued in future: MLA|MANGALURU|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The “Main Bhi Chowkidar” campaign will not be restricted just to the Lok Sabha elections but it will be continued in the future too, said Karkala MLA Sunil Kumar here on Sunday. Addressing BJP workers at the party’s election office before a video interaction of Prime Minister Narendra Modi with “chowkidars” from across the country, Mr. Kumar said that the “chowkidars” will work to bring social and education transformation at the booth level. There will also be personal transformation in each “chowkidar”. Mr. Kumar said that Mr. Modi was a “chowkidar” in all fields. In his five-year rule, Mr. Modi had brought the county onto the world stage and it [India] was now a force to reckon with. There can be no comparison of “Chowkidar” Mr. Modi with H.D. Kumaraswamy and Mamata Bannerjee who are accused of favouring those charged with corruption. By getting BJP candidate Nalin Kumar Kateel elected from Dakshina Kannada, people will pave way for Mr. Modi to become Prime Minister for a second term. Following Mr. Kumar’s speech, party activists watched on an LCD screen the two-hour-long telecast of Mr. Modi’s interaction with “chowkidars”.

‘BJP has failed people of Malnad region’|Shivamogga|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|D.K. Shivakumar, Minister for Water Resources, has said that MPs of Bharatiya Janata Party who have represented Shivamogga seat since 2009 have failed to raise the problems faced by the people of Malnad region in the Parliament. Speaking to presspersons here on Sunday, he said in the Lok Sabha election, the voters would teach the BJP a lesson for the failure of its MPs to respond to their woes. Referring to the report of the K. Kasturirangan panel on the conservation of Western Ghats, he said that though the report had created apprehension among the people on displacement and on restrictions imposed on implementation of development works in ecologically sensitive areas, neither B.S. Yeddyurappa, who was elected from Shivamogga seat in 2014, nor B.Y. Raghavendra, who won in 2009 and emerged victorious in the recently-held byelection, have raised questions on the issue in the parliament. Land grants He added that even with regard to introducing amendment to the Forest Rights Act, 2006, to ensure conferring land grants to the applicants in an expedited manner, both Mr. Yeddyurappa and Mr. Raghavendra have maintained silence in the Parliament. Commenting on the problems faced by arecanut growers owing to fluctuations in the price and fungal infections, he said the slew of promises extended by Amit Shah, BJP national president, in Tirthahalli in 2018 on protecting the interests of arecanut growers remained unfulfilled. Addressing a joint meeting of the workers of Congress and JD(S) in Tirthahalli town later, he said that by maintaining better coordination between the cadres of both parties during campaigning, it was possible to wrest Shivamogga parliamentary seat from the BJP. The Congress has ceded Shivamogga seat to JD(S) as part of seat sharing agreement and it was the responsibility of the leaders of both parties to strive for the victory of Madhu Bangarappa, JD(S) candidate. The workers of both the parties should understand that the coalition government was formed to keep divisive forces at bay, he added. Kimmane Rathnakar, former Minister; R.M. Manjunatha Gowda, president, JD(S) district unit; and H.S. Sundaresh, president, Shivamogga District Congress Committee, were present.

Last year’s heavy rains reduce tobacco output in State by 14 million kg|MYSURU|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Tobacco crop in the State, which was badly affected owing to the rains and floods last year, barely crossed 85 million kg against the authorised crop size of 99 million kg for 2018-19, accounting for an estimated loss of Rs. 200 crore to farmers. The conclusion of the annual tobacco auction season in the State last week saw farmers disposing of 14 million kg less than the authorised crop size. The Tobacco Board, which controls the cultivation of the crop and its sale, attributed the decline in the output of the commodity to the heavy rains that lashed the tobacco growing regions in Mysuru durin last July and August. A lot of damage to tobacco crop was noticed in Periyapatna, which borders Kodagu district the worst affected. Out of the 85 million kg sold at the auction platforms, 81 million kg was authorised crop while the remaining 4 million kg was unauthorised. Unauthorised tobacco is that which is cultivated in excess of the crop size sanctioned to each licensed farmer and the tobacco cultivated by an unlicensed farmer. An additional 15% tax is levied on the unauthorised tobacco, besides a penalty of Rs. 2 on every kg. Though the average price of tobacco went up marginally from the Rs. 139.40 per kg last year to Rs. 142.25 per kg this year, the decline in yield has hit the farmers hard, said Javare Gowda, President of Karnataka Virginia Flue Cured (VFC) Tobacco Growers’ Association, urging the Centre to adequately compensate the farmers. About 80% of the tobacco cultivated in Mysuru region, considered to be of superior quality, is exported to foreign countries for cigarette manufacturing. The farmers, however, had to keep their fingers crossed during the auction season in view of the confusing signals from foreign and domestic purchasers. Though the farmers were receiving a good price when the auction season began in September last year, the demand for tobacco reported a sudden slump in December last year with the traders citing “non-confirmation of export orders”. However, the failure of tobacco crop in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh brought the traders back to the auction platforms in Karnataka during February and March this year. “The price for a kg of bright quality tobacco crossed Rs. 180 per kg and reached even Rs. 188 per kg,” Mr Gowda said. Despite the prices looking up towards the end of the auction season, many tobacco farmers had suffered. “They will not be able to clear their loans and will go into debt,” said Mr. Gowda. Meanwhile, the Tobacco Board has fixed a crop size of 100 million kg for 2019-20. The traders had given an indent for purchase of 105 million kg and the Board eventually decided to fix the crop size for 100 million kg.  4 million kg was unauthoried  Fact sheet Authorised tobacco crop size for 2018-19 was 99 million kg 85 million kg of crop sold during auction 4 million kg out of that was unauthorised tobacco  Unauthorised tobacco is that which is cultivated in excess of the crop size sanctioned to each licensed farmer, and the tobacco cultivated by an unlicensed farmer

Don’t support dynastic politics: Hassan MLA|Hassan|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Likening the hold of former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda and his family in the district to the British rule, Hassan MLA Preetham Gowda, on Sunday, appealed to the public to vote for the BJP to free the district from the clutches of the ‘British’ of the present times. Addressing a campaign meeting at Sakleshpur, Mr. Preetham Gowda said if Prajwal Gowda won, the district would be under the control of the Gowda family for 50 more years. “The present election in Hassan is the fight to save democracy. It is similar to the freedom struggle against the British. The Gowda family is like British of Hassan,” he said. The MLA said people should support the BJP to see Narendra Modi as Prime Minister for a second term. BJP supporters Uday Gowda and Narve Somashekhar, who allegedly attempted to lure MLAs of the Congress and the JD(S) as part of BJP’s Operation Lotus exercise, participated in the election campaign meeting at Sakleshpur on Sunday. There were reports that Uday Gowda had attempted to lure H.K. Kumaraswamy, Sakleshpur JD(S) MLA. Chief Minister H.D. Kumarswamy had also alleged that they had a role in Operation Lotus.  Belur BJP candidate A. Manju addressed campaign meetings in Belur and Halebidu on the day. He sought votes in favour of the BJP to put an end to dynastic rule of the Gowda family. “If the JD(S) candidate was defeated, the second line leaders of all parties would get due recognition in the district,” he said.

Railways deny job to labourer despite SC order|Kozhikode|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|E. Suresh Kumar does not know which door to knock at any more. “If they do not heed the order of the Supreme Court and the Prime Minister, then whom should I approach?” he asks. He has been waging a battle for the last more than 28 years with the Indian Railways demanding a job, which the National Human Rights Commission, the Railway Board, and the Central Administrative Tribunal have deemed as rightfully his. Suresh Kumar worked as a casual labourer in the capacity of a Mappila Khalasi under the engineering wing of the Southern Railway during the construction of the railway line between Hassan and Mangaluru in 1978-79. He worked under the Inspector of Works, Sakleshpur, in the same position during 1980-81. Together he worked for the Railways for 962 days. The Supreme Court had ordered the Railways to consider all those who were casual labourers on January 1, 1981 and had completed 360 working days as temporary labourers and to absorb those with the longest service, based on which Suresh Kumar was eligible for the job. However, he was left out of the list even as some of his juniors with shorter service were absorbed. His struggle to be included in the empanelled list started in 1990. Despite memorandums and court orders, the Railway General Manager refused to offer him the job. Speaking to reporters here recently, Suresh Kumar said he, being 59 years old, had only one year of service left, even if he was absorbed now. Moreover, he is from a poor financial background. He said the attitude of railway officials over the years had been nothing but cruel and demanded that he be absorbed into the service and paid compensation with retrospective effect since 1990 in accordance with the Supreme Court order.  Struggle for justice NHRC and CAT had upheld Suresh Kumar’s eligibility for job He has demanded that he be absorbed into service and compensated His struggle to be included in the empanelled list started in 1990

Standard treatment guidelines for cancers|Thiruvananthapuram|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|All cancer care facilities in the State, both private and public sector, will have to mandatorily set up multidisciplinary tumour boards and ensure that patients are provided optimum treatment as per the standard treatment guidelines. Even smaller cancer centres will have to develop, in course, multidisciplinary chemo/tumour boards, including medical, radiation and surgical oncologists, who will together decide the best course of treatment for every patient. The decisions were taken at a meeting of oncologists from 30-odd private and public sector cancer care institutions across the State at the Regional Cancer Centre (RCC) here over the weekend, to aid the State government’s efforts to draw up standard treatment guidelines for common cancers in the State. Final draft “Over 85 oncologists, including the heads of department from various centres, participated in the meeting and we have been able to cover a lot of new ground. We have drawn up guidelines for almost all cancers. The final draft will be drawn up and vetted at a similar meeting to be held next week at Thalassery, which will be submitted to the government,” B. Satheesan, Director of Malabar Cancer Centre, who is coordinating the whole exercise, toldThe Hindu. Though Kerala has a well-established system for diagnosis and treatment of cancer, inequity in access to care and lack of uniformity in treatment strategies have been a major challenge. Within 50 km Equitable access to affordable cancer care is one of the main aims of Kerala Cancer Control Strategy 2017-30, which envisages a network of cancer care facilities across the State, offering a set of defined services and optimum treatment to all cancer patients within 50 km radius of their residence “Uniform treatment guidelines will ensure that a cancer patient will receive a defined optimum standard of care, whichever institution he opts to go. The challenge was to reach a consensus about the guidelines which have to be implemented by cancer care institutions,” Moni Kuriakose, Director of Kochi Cancer Centre, said . 10 cancers The standard guidelines cover at least 10 common cancers in the State, starting with breast cancer, cancer of the cervix, oral cavity, lung, colo-rectal cancers, lymphomas, leukemias and genito-urinary cancers, brain tumours and bone cancers. “We have also decided to review the guidelines every year, alongside the latest evidence. The best part is that once the guidelines are implemented, every cancer care centre in the State will be able to generate its own evidence, which we will bring to the table. I am very optimistic that we will soon usher in a new era in cancer management in Kerala, based on standard guidelines developed from our own clinical evidence,” Dr. Satheesan said.

New fish-based protein snack to hit shelves|KOCHI|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The National Institute of Fisheries Post Harvest Technology and Training (NIFPHATT) here has something unique to offer to people on the lookout for a fish-based protein snack. The institute has launched Fishture, which combines the enjoyment of a snack and the nutritive value of fish. Officials of the institute said the product would hit the shelves in April. It will be available at its outlet opposite Fine Arts Hall close to the lakeside campus of the Cochin University of Science and Technology near Pallimukku, they said. Food technologists at the institute pointed out that children required essential nutrients for growth. But snacks are preferred to high-quality food by them. Unfortunately, many children avoid fish because of its flavour and fear of consuming fish bones. Parents could give Fishture, which is a protein-enriched mixture, as a value-added ready-to-eat snack to their children, they said. The officials said the growth of a child involved muscle/tissue development and brain development. Fish is a unique food having both these nutritive factors combined, that is essential amino acids for tissue growth and essential Omega-3 fatty acids for brain development, they added. Value-added products The institute has been involved in developing value-added products through process and product diversification from all varieties of fish, including low-value, unconventional species and seasonally abundant fishes. It also disseminates upgraded technology through consultancy, training, popularisation of products, and consumer response surveys. Details about Fishture can be had from NIFPHATT.

No let-up in accidents on Ghat Road|Kozhikode|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Even after the widening and renovation of Thamarassery Ghat Road, there is no let up in freak accidents caused by reckless drivers on the route. Poor lane discipline and careless overtaking are causing accidents in the area. Ghat Road Protection Committee members, pointing out that there were about five major accidents in the area last week, say there is not even a single speed detection camera on the key stretch of the national highway. Lack of checking There is no regular checking by the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) and the police on the stretch, they add. They also allege that the police arrive only during accidents on the stretch. The inspection of overloaded vehicles by MVD squads, which was once enforced very strictly to save the beautiful mountain pass, is not taking place now, they say. “The overloaded tipper lorries from crushers in Mukkom and surrounding regions are a safety threat on the route and they create huge traffic snarls because of their slow movement. Very often, the attempt of another vehicle to overtake the trucks after tailgating ends up in head-on collision with vehicles coming from the opposite direction,” says P.K. Sukumaran, general secretary of the Ghat Road Protection Committee. He also points out that trucks returning from Wayanad to Mukkom often violate speed regulations and create a terror for other drivers on the road. Though the widening of hairpin turns, which was a long-pending demand, has already been completed covering all the risky stretches, Ghat Road committee members say reckless driving by some private bus drivers along such hairpin turns double the safety risk of other vehicles. The committee is planning to submit a memorandum to the District Collector on Tuesday demanding the deployment of 24x7 checking squads on the route and installation of speed detection cameras.

BJP will ditch Yeddyurappa after polls, says DKS|Shivamogga|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|D.K. Shivakumar, Minister for Water Resources, said the BJP Central leadership will sideline its State unit president B.S. Yeddyurappa after the Lok Sabha election. “The senior leaders are being eased out by the BJP Central leadership. After the Lok Sabha election, the party will ditch Mr. Yeddyurappa also,” he told presspersons here on Sunday. He said though Mr. Yeddyurappa was elected to Lok Sabha in 2014, he was not made a Union Minister. Expressing regret for the denial of ticket to Tejaswini Ananth Kumar to contest from Bengaluru South Lok Sabha seat, he said that this was an example of the way in which the BJP was treating the families of some leaders. As Ms. Kumar was also involved in social service activities, the party should have provided her an opportunity to contest the election, he said. Regarding the recent raids conducted by I-T officials in Karnataka, he said that the BJP that is in power at the Centre was misusing Central agencies including the I-T Department to fulfil its political ends. Such raids were conducted even during the Assembly election in 2018. He questioned the reason behind not conducting raids on the premises of any BJP leader or businesspersons who support the party.

Man falls into well, dies|KOCHI|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|A man who was cleaning a well at a house near the Kalamassery railway overbridge fell into the well and died on Sunday.

Elections about India’s growth and progress: Smriti Irani|MYSURU|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Union Textiles Minister Smriti Irani said in Kodagu on Sunday that the parliamentary elections were not about the re-election of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but about making a choice for the country’s development. Addressing a rally at Gonikoppal, Ms. Irani said Mr. Modi had achieved in five years what the Congress could not in 55. The BJP leader said that the people of the country were deprived of the fruits of development while Congress leaders, including the Gandhi-Vadra family, prospered under the Congress rule. Referring to the Jan Dhan Yojana, she said there were critics who had slammed the BJP and the PM when he announced that government subsidies would be directly transferred to individual bank accounts, lest they be siphoned off by middlemen. The critics said the poor did not have access to bank accounts, said Ms. Irani, adding that that had been the legacy of 55 years of Congress rule. “There were eight crore fraudulent bank accounts detected and closed as they were siphoning off taxpayers’ money from the government’s treasury. In Karnataka alone, 1.4 crore bank accounts were opened while 30 crore people for the first time had subsidy coming into their accounts across the country,” she said. Corruption and Congress The Minister also said the Congress was synonymous with corruption. Without naming the late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, she said that “a prominent Congress leader” had stated that out of every single rupee released for the poor from Delhi, only 10 paisa reached the beneficiary. “What the Congress did not spell out was where the remaining 90 paisa went, but people of the country know better about who benefited.” She listed a slew of programmes launched by the NDA government and said that under the Ujjwala scheme, LPG cylinders were distributed to seven crore poor families in the country, including 28 lakh from Karnataka. She said the scheme had helped end the scourge of smoke-filled kitchens in rural areas which had affected the health of the women in the countryside. “Contrast this with personal enrichment of Congress leaders even as the people of the country were left behind and deprived of the benefits and fruits of development during the 55 years of [Congress] rule,” Ms. Irani said. The BJP leader invoked the martial traditions prevalent in Kodagu and said that the people of the region sacrifice their life for safeguarding the country, butthey would never have imagined that a day would come when a Congress leader would dub the Chief of Army Staff a “goonda” or seek proof for retaliatory action and “belittle their sacrifices”. Also launching a broadside at the coalition government in the State, Ms. Irani said people have seen the spectacle of the coalition partners fighting it out in the open over petty issues and then closing ranks and coming together when there were Income Tax raids on corrupt contractors.

Development as a springboard to fight elections|THIRUVANANTHAPURAM|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|As the campaign for the Lok Sabha election started in the State in right earnest last week, a report in newspapers urging people in the southern districts to be vigilant as the power line linking the Kudankulam nuclear power plant to Kochi was being charged might not have gained much attention. The much-awaited Edamon-Kochi 400-kV transmission corridor, crucial for hauling Kerala’s share of power from Kudankulam, is all set for commissioning. Though the Tirunelveli-Edamon stretch was completed in 2010, the Edamon-Kochi stretch, so crucial for the State’s power security, has been delayed for one reason or the other. Not many on the campaign front are heard mentioning about the decisive intervention of the State government that fast-tracked the project. Development, apparently, is not meaty enough for campaigners unless there is a seamy side to it. And when development issues and infrastructure initiatives finally bask in the poll limelight, that raises questions. “Although poverty eradication, Make in India, corruption, demonetisation, cross-border terrorism, and national security will dominate the campaign rhetoric, the performance of the State government will also be judged by the electorate,” says activist and former president of the Kerala Sasthra Sahitya Parishad R.V.G. Menon. Though the model code of conduct bars the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government from showcasing its initiatives, campaign managers of the front are not losing the opportunity. The achievements in infrastructure build-up are in sectors having a bearing on the lives of ordinary people, and the LDF leadership seeks to juxtapose them to the pro-big business development strategy of the Centre. “Upgrade of infrastructure in government schools and setting up of modern health-care facilities are there for all to see. Restoring public confidence in government hospitals has benefited 40% of the population. And, how can you ignore migration of around 2.5 lakh students to public schools over three years,” claims a State Planning Board member. But the United Democratic Front seeks to differ. The Opposition front is to come up with a dossier on the development projects initiated under its governments in the past. “We will expose the claims of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and LDF governments on the development front,” says Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee general secretary Thampanoor Ravi. Development of the rail network, the Vizhinjam deepwater seaport, and privatisation of the Thiruvananthapuram airport find mention in the campaign of both fronts as well as the Bharatiya Janata Party owing to the involvement of the Central government in these projects, both as facilitators and promoters. “Infrastructure and development initiatives of the NDA government will be projected in the campaign. We will also take to the people the negative attitude of the State government towards Centrally funded schemes such as health insurance,” says BJP spokesman M.S. Kumar.

The leaders also engaged in dialogue with street vendors outside these parks to gauge their mood and sought their votes for the party. Later, they visited the Central Market area in the city and interacted with labourers, customers and traders. As it was Sunday, the market area was buzzing with activity with people thronging it for shopping. Interacting with women traders and workers, Mr. Rai said he has plans to encourage ornamental fish farming in the constituency by women as well as self-help groups. Ornamental fish farming has become a profitable industry these days, he said. Election office The early-morning vote marathon was followed by the inauguration of the party’s election office at Bendoor. Former Minister B. Ramanath Rai joined the league in inaugurating the office. Bolara Mukhyaprana temple priest Guruprasad Bhat, Rosario Cathedral Parish priest Fr. J.B. Crasta and Rahmania Jumma Masjid Moulvi Abdul Rahman Sahadi lit the lamp to mark the inauguration of the office. Meanwhile, Mr. Shivakumar's campaign on Monday at Belthangady and Puttur, is seen as a move to woo Vokkaliga (Gowda) voters who are present in large numbers in these places. Mr. Shivakumar will address the meeting at the Ambedkar Bhavan complex at 10.30 a.m. in Belthangady and at Darbe Grounds in Puttur at 4 p.m., a communiqué from the District Congress Committee said.

Five seek treatment for heatstroke|KOCHI|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Five persons have sought treatment for sunburn at various hospitals in the district, the District Medical Officer (DMO) has said. They include a 10-year-old who was spending time in a park in the city and a 70-year-old from Kizhakambalam. A woman from Thrikkakara was hospitalised following sunstroke on Friday.

Fee hike at Ponnarimangalam may take a toll on motorists|KOCHI|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The introduction of the revised user fee at the Ponnarimangalam toll plaza on the Container Terminal Road is likely to witness public resistance. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has announced that the revised user fee will come into effect from April 1. Residents and container lorry operators had earlier protested against the user fee. Going by the revised tariff plan, people with non-commercial vehicles living within 20-km radius of the toll plaza can get a monthly pass on payment of Rs. 265. All other cars, jeeps, vans and light motor vehicles will have to pay Rs. 50 as fee for single trip and Rs. 75 if they complete return trip the same day. On a monthly basis, such vehicles have to pay Rs. 1,640 for 50 trips. All commercial vehicles registered in this category will attract additional fee ranging from Rs. 25 to Rs. 160 depending on their classification. The NHAI has also hiked fee for light commercial and light goods vehicles, commercial vehicles with multiple axles and over-sized vehicles.  ‘Unacceptable’ The user fee proposed for people residing in the vicinity of toll plaza was unacceptable, said Mulavukad panchayat president Viji Shajan. The panchayat had earlier demanded that the vehicles of Mulavukad residents and those of people coming to the panchayat be excluded from the ambit of the user fee. The demand was raised at a meeting convened by the District Collector recently, she added. Container Terminal Monitoring Committee convener Charles George has sought the intervention of the Chief Minister in the issue. The NHAI has hiked the user fee at a time when various stakeholders have been demanding a rollback of the earlier tariff. The existing rates will force multi-axle vehicles to shell out around Rs. 2,500 a day. Though there was an offer earlier to provide free parking for vehicles, each vehicle would be charged around Rs. 300 a day as parking fee, he said.

SAVE projects across State planned|Kozhikode|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Education Department is considering implementing SAVE (Student Army for Vivid Environment) in schools across the State. Secretary of Public Education A. Shajahan was in the district on Saturday to discuss the unique educational activities being organised in Kozhikode under the aegis of SAVE and ACT (Association of Creative Teachers). SAVE has been active in schools in Kozhikode district for nearly five years, implementing various projects to ensure that students are directly involved in the upkeep of the environment. Some programmes of SAVE include ‘Zero budget plastic waste management’, ‘Pakshikku kudineer’, ‘Jeevajalam’, ‘Mazhayatra’, and ‘Back to ink pen’. In Zero budget waste management, students manage plastic waste at their homes. They wash, dry, and store plastic waste, which is collected at the schools once in three months and sent for recycling. Mazhayatra is a trip down a hill enjoying the rain and the beauty of the Western Ghats. The students maintain a pitcher full of water near their houses and schools for birds during summer under the Pakshikku kudineer programme. Under Jeevajalam, every school selects a water source and revive it, if needed, under the aegis of the school PTA and local people and protect it thereafter. There is also a project to encourage children to use ink pens and forsake ball point pens. Nalla Vellam Nalla Pathram is a programme that encourages students to forsake plastic water bottles and adopt steel or glass bottles. Besides, there are programmes for setting up medicinal and butterfly gardens at every school, with each class to plant and maintain a tree and maintain a groove at the school with enough land. Some programmes of DIET (District Institute of Education and Training) and Educare project of the Kozhikode District Panchayat are also being considered to be implemented Statewide. Deputy Director of Education E.K. Suresh Kumar, environmentalist T. Shobheendran, and SAVE coordinator Vadayakkandy Narayanan handed over the project report to Mr. Shahjahan. DIET principal D. Padmanabhan and Regional Deputy Director of Higher Secondary Education K. Gokula Krishnan, besides district coordinator of Save Public Education Committee G. Madhu were present.
Caste game trumps local issues|Alappuzha|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Can the United Democratic Front (UDF) score a hat trick of victories or will the Left Democratic Front (LDF) pull off a surprise? The Mavelikara (SC reserved) Lok Sabha constituency cannot be considered a bastion of anyone, but historically it has shown inclination towards the UDF and Congress party. After the constituency came into being in 1962, it has elected Congress candidates or the party supported candidates 10 times in 14 elections. It underwent major delimitation process twice, last time in 2008. The present Lok Sabha segment is spread over three districts of Alappuzha, Kollam and Kottayam covering seven Assembly constituencies between Kuttanad and Pathanapuram. In a bid to retain the seat, the Congress has fielded incumbent Kodikunnil Suresh, MP, who is looking to make it three victories in a row. The LDF, on the other hand hopes to upset the UDF applecart, has given ticket to Chittayam Gopakumar of the Communist Party of India (CPI), sitting MLA representing Adoor Assembly constituency. Making it a triangular contest is the candidature of Thazhava Sahadevan, fielded by the Bharat Dharma Jana Sena (BDJS), an ally of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). In 2009 and 2014, Mr. Suresh defeated his nearest rival R.S. Anil and Chengara Surendran of the CPI by a margin of 48,048 and 32,737 votes respectively.  Deciding factors The development agenda is the dominant poll narrative in the constituency, albeit the Sabarimala issue and last year’s devastating floods are also talking points. However, with various Christian organisations, Nair Service Society (NSS) and Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP) Yogam holding sway over the constituency, the caste and religious equations will be the deciding factor. The Scheduled Caste community is a sizeable vote share at least in one Assembly constituency in the Lok Sabha segment. The Kerala Congress (B), which switched sides to LDF from UDF, will be a factor at least in a couple of places. While, the UDF is seeking votes for the continuation of the development activities, the LDF is alleging a lack of progress in the last 10 years. The LDF also derives strength from occasional surprises the constituency sprang up. In 2004, when C.S. Sujatha of the CPI(M) defeated Congress candidate Ramesh Chennithala by a margin of 7,414 votes. The other three times, the constituency elected a candidate other than the Congress/supported candidates were in 1967, 1980 and 1984. In 2016 Assembly elections, six out of the seven Assembly constituencies sided with the LDF. The UDF could bag only Changanassery.


KWA to pump 5 mld more from today|THIRUVANANTHAPURAM|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|With demand for water soaring during the summer, the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) will begin pumping an additional five million litres a day (mld) from Aruvikkara to the capital city area from Monday. At present, the city region consumes approximately 270 mld. New pumping mains Anticipating an increase in the summer demand, the KWA has installed two new pumping mains for increasing production from Aruvikkara. One of the two new pipelines connected the raw water unit to the purification plant at Chithirakkunnu, Aruvikkara. The second line connected the plant to the reservoir, a KWA official said. The decision to add the new pumping mains were taken at relatively short notice by Additional Chief Secretary (Water Resources) Vishwas Mehta and KWA managing director A. Kowsigan, a KWA official said. “We completed the work in 15 days. The new arrangement will allow us to pump an additional five mld to the city from Monday,” the official said. As part of its summer preparations, the KWA had already initiated a set of measures for ensuring unhindered supply to the capital city. Booster unit This included a booster unit to ensure adequate supply to the reservoir at Vellayambalam. To cater to the emerging demand, KWA plans to commission a new 75-mld plant at Aruvikkara by 2020 and a 100-mld plant at Neyyar by March 2021. At present, the city is fed by a 72-mld plant, a 74-mld plant (Japan International Cooperation Agency-assisted project) and an 86-mld plant at Aruvikkara. There is also a 36-mld treatment plant at Water Works, Vellayambalam. Water in tankers In view of the summer, KWA has started supplying water in tanker in several areas facing drinking water shortage. The government-run water utility has also activated its anti-water theft squads to curb misuse during the summer months.

Chayalode ups ante against quarrying|PATHANAMTHITTA|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Residents of the small hamlet of Chayalode situated in the foothills of the environmentally sensitive Pulipparamala in Enadimangalam grama panchayat in Adoor taluk have decided to boycott the ensuing general elections. The villagers, under the aegis of the Chayalode Janakeeya Samiti (CJS), have started displaying posters at the entrance of their homes, denying entry to politicians engaged in poll campaign, to protest against the alleged indifferent attitude of various parties towards their agitation against the move to start granite quarrying at Pulimalappara.“We have lost faith in politicians who have deceived hapless villagers of Chayalode,” says K.G.Rajan, samiti secretary. Walls of as many as 150 households at Chayalode have sported a poster at their entrance itself, saying a ‘No entry to election campaigners’. Lijin K.Eapen, samiti spokesperson; P.K.Thomas, convener; Ajeesh George, Sheena Rajan, Lissie Eapen, Samuel Mathew, and Samuel Baby, office-bearers, said the villagers have decided to intensify the agitation against the proposed granite quarry at Pulimalappara. Mr. Eapen toldThe Hinduthat, with the onset of summer, Pulimalappara and surrounding areas have been reeling under acute drinking water scarcity. He said there were even attempts by the politician-quarry lobby nexus to create communal problems in the otherwise peaceful village to divert public attention from the core environmental issue. The sad part is that even the grama panchayat too backed the quarry lobby who have managed to obtain various clearances for quarrying through the backdoor, samiti leaders alleged. The janakeeya samiti has already moved the Kerala High Court against the permission granted by the panchayat and the Mining and Geology Department for granite quarrying at Pulimalappara, they said. Cancellation sought The samiti leaders demanded immediate cancellation of various clearances granted for granite quarrying at Pulimalappara.

Key role for SPC in crime prevention: Governor|THIRUVANANTHAPURAM|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Governor P. Sathasivam has emphasised the importance of Student Police Cadet (SPC) project in keeping youngsters away from crime and anti-social activities. Inaugurating the SPC Change Leaders meet, a State-level summer camp, at the Special Armed Police camp at Peroorkada on Sunday, Mr. Sathasivam said there had been an increase in children finding themselves on the wrong side of law in recent times. “Student life is a period when youngsters are misguided into social evils, including intolerance, substance abuse, deviant behaviour and anti-establishment violence. Children should have the courage to say a firm ‘no’ to such temptations. The Student Police Cadets can help other students in fighting such evils,” he said. Future leaders He also exhorted the cadets to strive to become future leaders committed to nation building. He said the idea of leadership involved the willingness to take up responsibilities. “Leadership does not confer authority on people, instead it puts the weight of responsibility and the need for ethical behaviour. As a leader, you are responsible for your success as well as the success of those around you. True leadership qualities can be nurtured only through meaningful social interactions. The training of a Student Police Cadet involves the best social interactions which will empower you to develop your innate capabilities and give you a strong will to act against social evils,” Mr. Sathasivam said. Proud model The Governor added that the project had made Kerala proud by offering a model for other States and even nations to emulate. The Government of India had decided to implement the programme in all States and Union Territories from 2018. The Governor lighted a lamp as a tribute to the soldiers killed in the terror attack in Pulwama. The participants held lit candles to mark the occasion. State Police Chief Loknath Behera presided over the function. He said 649 schools in the State had the SPC project. Efforts were on to extend the programme to all schools in the State.  The camp will conclude on April 7.

Accused in murder attempt case held|THIRUVANANTHAPURAM|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Thiruvananthapuram Rural police have arrested an accused in a murder attempt case after obtaining his extradition from the UAE. The accused, Jishnu Baiju, a habitual offender, was wanted for his role in attempting to murder a fruit seller who resisted his bid to extort money. The victim, Amal Raj of Wayanad, had sustained serious injuries after he was attacked with a knife at Vamanapuram on December 24, 2016. His custody was obtained with the assistance of the Interpol. The Venjaramoodu police recorded his arrest.

Rahul has fled from the real battle: CPI|Kozhikode|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Congress president Rahul Gandhi has run away from the real battle against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in north India by deciding to contest from Wayanad, Communist Party of India (CPI) national secretariat member Binoy Viswam has alleged. The Rajya Sabha MP told the media here on Sunday that the decision exhibited Congress’s “political bankruptcy”. “We, the CPI, or the Left Democratic Front, are not afraid of his entry to the electoral scene.” Mr. Viswam said the Congress had forgotten its role in leading the fight against the RSS-BJP which had been trying to wipe out our constitutional values.

Fishermen anxious about frequent mid-sea accidents|KOCHI|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Saturday morning mid-sea accident in which three fishermen were hurt after their boat was hit by a merchant vessel was the third in just more than six months and fishermen have expressed anxiety over the frequency of such incidents involving merchant vessels. Three fishermen were killed and nine went missing after a merchant vessel and fishing boatOceaniccollided off the Munambam coast in the first week of August last year. In another incident, fibre boatDivinewas hit by a merchant vessel. There were no deaths or serious injuries in the accident. The fishers’ unions have called for immediate government intervention as well as coordination among maritime safety agencies for better cover for fishermen. Shipping channel Kerala Swathanthra Matsya Thozhilali Federation general secretary V.D. Majeendran has demanded that the proposed coastal sea shipping route be avoided and that the fishing grounds of traditional fishermen be protected. Shipping channel should be allowed only through deep sea, he said. Charles George of Matsya Thozhilali Aikya Vedhi said the shipping channel issue should not be confused with the safety of fishermen. The safety agencies and the Joint Operations Centre in Kochi had not been on the side of the fishermen, he alleged. It should be investigated whether merchant ships using the channel close to Kerala coast follow the safety protocol and code of conduct or not, he said. He called for strengthening the monitoring, control and surveillance system even as fishermen were caught between serious fish shortage and dangers at sea.

This keeper of books is all set for a new chapter|KOCHI|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|It was Thomas Kempis, who said, “Everywhere I have sought peace and not found it but in a corner with a book”. His spirit is not dead nor has his tribe decreased. Thousands of book lovers toil on in their given niches, spreading the love of the written word even as the book’s death is foretold in a thousand modern day tales. It was during one such spell of rumours of the death of books that V.G. Ramachandran, Ernakulam Public Library’s senior librarian, began his career as a young man in his late teens. Mr. Ramachandran retired on Sunday as senior librarian after 39 years of service. His colleagues, members of the library and the book-loving public were there in large numbers to felicitate him. “The library gave me a whole new life,” said Mr. Ramachandran on Sunday, visibly moved by the way time had passed since he joined the library in August 1980 after passing Class X. Since then he completed his post-graduate studies in library science. He said he would dedicate his time to reviving libraries in rural areas in Ernakulam district that had great potential for growth. He will focus immediately on the 64 libraries in Kanayannur taluk. His work will certainly prolong, considering that there are over 500 libraries in rural areas in the district. Between his joining service and retiring, the membership in the Ernakulam Public Library has risen from just around 1,000 to over 15,000. The number of books has risen from about 25,000 to two lakh. Mr. Ramachandran remembered that the early 1990s witnessed a rapid fall in readership. “Reading is dead,” said most headlines on the wings of the arrival of computers, he recalled. However, the library staff, led by him, took on the challenge and went out with missionary zeal to convert the public into readers of books. “We visited virtually all homes and offices in Ernakulam to convince people to take up reading,” he said. Between 3,000 and 4,000 new members were added during the campaign, he said. The trend has continued. Around a thousand people visit the Ernakulam Public Library daily and about 500 books are given out each day with the help of new technology that include RFID-enabled book drop and issue facilities. Weekly screening of world cinema classics and various competitions were additional incentives for the members, he said.

Fix priorities: Yechury to Cong.|THIRUVANANTHAPURAM|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Reacting to the Congress’s announcement of Rahul Gandhi as its candidate from the Wayanad constituency, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said the Congress should think about what message it was conveying at a time when the whole country is working towards defeating BJP. “Our priorities are clear. We are fighting this elections to defeat the BJP, increase our strength in the Parliament and ensure an alternative secular government at the Centre. The Congress must decide what its priorities are. In Kerala, the political contest is between the LDF and the UDF. The BJP is not a force to reckon with,” he said, addressing a meet the press programme here on Sunday. Mr. Yechury said the people of Kerala should ask whether Rahul Gandhi is coming to Kerala for symbolism or to represent the people here, as he cannot be an MP from both places. Scene in 2004 He expressed confidence that Keralites would show immense maturity like in the past, especially in 2004. “Before the 2004 elections, when CPI(M) general secretary Harkishan Singh Surjit said that we will form an alternative government, nobody thought it possible. The Kerala electorate voted emphatically to ensure 18 seats for the LDF. The stronger left presence enabled us to put pressure to ensure the passing of policies like MGNREGA, RTI and Forest Rights Act. I am sure this time we will win 20 out of 20 from Kerala,” said Mr. Yechury. On being asked whether Rahul’s candidature will affect the secular alternative alliance, he said the process of forming such an alliance would begin only after the elections. On BJP’s claim that everyone has united against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said the NDA consisted of 32 parties, which is much bigger than the ‘Mahagathbandhan’.

Kanakolsavam to begin on April 5|THIRUVANANTHAPURAM|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Thiruvananthapuram Press Club is organising ‘Kanakolsavam,’ billed as a celebration of knowledge and entertainment, from April 5 to 15 at the Kanakakkunnu Palace grounds.

Failing to rise above a die-hard fan tribute|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|“It seems you watch quite a lot of popular masala movies,” says one of the many conniving characters inLuciferto another, who had just drawn an analogy from popular cinema to explain a political situation. “Yes. I watch them all. It lets you know the public’s taste. I know in advance which scenes they will cheer for,” replies the other one. This could very well be a scene inspired from a pre-shooting discussion between the film’s writer Murali Gopi and director Prithviraj. The film is so jam-packed with such scenes aimed at eliciting cheers from Mohanlal fanboys that it just has little space left for craft and novelty. The story, though set in Kerala, is populated with characters clearly inspired from real-life national political figures, with the writer having the liberty to twist it the way he wants. P.K. Ramdas, the Chief Minister and leader of the IUF party, passes away, leading to questions on succession. Daughter Priyadarshini (Manju Warrier) and son Jatin Das (Tovino) are disinterested, while son-in-law Bobby (Vivek Oberoi), flush with funds from the drug cartel, is trying to wrest control. But Ramdas’s trusted disciple Stephen Nedumpally (Mohanlal) is a thorn in the flesh for him. Grand scale Prithviraj envisions all this in a grand scale, so evident in the staging of the scenes, with many of them populated with mammoth crowds. Then there are the zillion slow motion scenes paying tributes to every minute movement of the star. The many characters and parallel stories all jostle for attention, while Stephen remains the focus all through. Clueless The director has a grip of the proceedings in the initial half, although the compulsion to showcase those punch dialogues and superhero stunts frequently is quite palpable. Some of these are indeed a guilty pleasure. But all the political intrigue takes a back seat in the latter half, as Lucifer sets out for revenge. By the end of it, the director seems pretty clueless, especially in a long drawn out final battle, interspersed with a never-ending, anachronistic “item dance” sequence. Evil and lesser evil The core theme of the story, sprinkled with pointless Biblical allusions, is that politics is a fight between evil and lesser evil. “Idealism is dead,” says one character while another says “Politics is comedy”, taking the same old apolitical highway. Coming amid a hectic election season, the film is no good advertisement for democracy. Rather, it seems a wish list for a flawed, all-powerful, invincible saviour. Luciferis almost a die-hard Mohanlal fan’s fantasy come true, but unfortunately it fails to rise above that. S.R. Praveen

‘BJP will record impressive win’|Thiruvananthapuram|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Congress decision to field Rahul Gandhi from Wayanad smacks of its minority appeasement policy and the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) will field a strong contender against him, says Bharatiya Janata Party State president P.S. Sreedharan Pillai. How do you gauge Mr. Gandhi’s entry to Wayanad? Will it impact other segments? This is a desperate bid by the Congress to evade the threat posed by the NDA and hush up intra-party dissensions. Had Mr. Gandhi been serious in throwing down the gauntlet, especially in Kerala, he should have contested from Thiruvananthapuram or Pathanamthitta. It is a shame that the Congress State leadership that had unilaterally announced their candidate for Wayanad had to beat a retreat. The confusion in announcing the candidature of Mr. Gandhi has exposed the internal dissensions in the party. The BJP will record an impressive win in Kerala and our vote share will go up. Mr. Gandhi’s candidature will not have any impact elsewhere. Is the BJP a force to be reckoned with in Wayanad, especially since Janadhipatya Rashtriya Samithy leader C.K. Janu has quit the NDA? Wayanad is not an alien terrain for the BJP. We have a strong base since the formation of the Jan Sangh and we are confident of proving our worth. The Congress is relying on the dominant minority presence in the Assembly segments in Malappuram. It will not be a cakewalk for Mr. Gandhi or the United Democratic Front. The State NDA too had to weather similar bouts of indecision in finalising candidates, isn’t it? No. Our choice was unanimous. We cleared it without any hitch. I opted out of the race since I have to coordinate electioneering. Reports of confusion and strife in the party are mere propaganda. What are your main campaign planks? The accent of our campaign is on the the continuance of the Modi regime and also on the atrocities meted out to Ayyappa devotees and also to the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh workers by the State government. Do you expect support from NSS and SNDP Yogam? Indeed. Both have historically supported the concept of justice and we are quite sure that they will bless us. Does the BJP expect cross-voting? Yes. The UDF and the Left Democratic Front are known for such poll malpractices, but we are ready to face it. Has the RSS wrested absolute control over the BJP’s election machinery? The RSS is a cultural organisation, but its workers are actively involved in the campaign. If returned to power, will the NDA frame legislation on women’s entry to Sabarimala? We will, only if it is legally tenable. This is a State subject and the State government should take the lead.

Film-shoot tragedy: Family of deceased stages protest|Bengaluru|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Relatives of 29-year-old Sumera and her five-year-old daughter Ahera, who were killed during the shooting of Kannada filmRanamat Mahadeva Kodigehalli village, staged a protest in front of the Bagalur police station on Friday, demanding immediate arrest of those responsible for the fatal blast. “It has been three days since the incident and the police are yet to make any arrests. The film crew had taken neither permission for the shooting nor any precautionary measures. This led to the loss of two lives,” said Tabrez Khan, Sumera’s husband. ‘Negligence’ Munawwar Khan, a relative of the victims, said it was a case of clear negligence on part of the film crew, but so far, no one from the Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce had offered any consolation to the family. The protesters demanded that the police speed up the investigation and said they would continue to protest till arrests were made. However, senior police officers spoke to the protesters and convinced them to end the agitation. They assured them that the probe was on and that arrests would be made soon. Meanwhile, Zainab, 8, who sustained multiple injuries in the accident, is recovering at a private hospital. Ranamis being produced by Kanakapura Srinivas and stars Chiranjeevi Sarja and Chetan. The film crew was shooting a car explosion scene at the Bengaluru Aerospace Park SEZ, Bagalur, on the city’s outskirts on Friday evening. Mr. Tabrez, along with his family, was heading to Soolibele to a relative’s house in a car when he noticed the road blocked because of the shoot. The family members got down to watch the action. Sumera, Ahera, and Zainab stood behind a film mobile van, parked near the spot where the car was set to explode. Multiple compressor cannons had been placed under an SUV. The cannons, when fired, were to propel the car into the air. However, when they were fired, one of the cannons — a 3.5-ft metallic cylinder — flew across the road with high velocity and hit the bystanders, killing Ahera and Sumera. Residents of a nearby village claimed that members of the film unit, instead of attending to the victims, fled from the scene, abandoning everything in a matter of minutes. It was the villagers from Mahadeva Kodigehalli who helped shift the injured Zainab to a hospital. Based on the complaint filed by Mr. Tabrez, the Bagalur police have registered an FIR against Shrinivas R., the producer, R.S. Production, director Samudram V., production manager Kiran, stunt manager Vijayan and his technical team, charging them under Section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and Section 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the IPC and under various sections of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908. Special team formed Kala Krishnaswamy, DCP (North-East) said a special team has been formed to track down the accused, who are on the run. “We have some clues that they might have fled to Hyderabad and Chennai. Efforts are on to track them down,” she said.

Stage of many a proverbial swing|Mohamed Nazeer|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The political substratum in Kannur district is predominantly tinged with red and the Communist party of India (Marxist) nurtures, justifiably, the claim that it is the party’s citadel that cannot be breached. The Kannur Lok Sabha constituency is different though. The history of general elections in the constituency over the past three decades shows to be true the perception that the distance between electoral victory and loss here is not difficult to traverse. As CPI(M) Central committee member P.K. Sreemathy is seeking re-election in the constituency, her 2014 rival K. Sudhakaran, KPCC working president, is in the fray to wrest it from her. He lost the last election by a margin of 6,566 votes. The 43,000-odd margin of votes by which the Congress strongman here had won the seat in 2009 turned out to be not too huge a hurdle for Ms. Sreemathy in 2014. The prestige that the CPI(M) attaches to the constituency is not fully compatible with the poll history of the seat. Since 1984, the Congress had won the seat in six elections and the CPI(M), in three. Hectic pace The campaign road shows of Ms. Sreemathy and Mr. Sudhakaran have already taken the battle for ballots here to a hectic pace. While the LDF camp began the campaign with huge hoardings and posters flaunting developmental achievements, including the Kannur airport and facelift of the Kannur railway station, among others, the UDF camp’s major weapon in the campaign armoury is an appeal against political violence. The murder of Youth Congress (YC) worker S.P. Shuhaib by alleged CPI(M) workers near Mattannur in February 2018 and the recent twin murders of Kripesh and Sarath Lal, YC workers, at Periye in Kasaragod, have lent a poignant touch to the UDF campaign. Though senior BJP leader C.K. Padmanabhan is contesting here, the BJP occupies a distant third position here. The party polled 51,636 votes. The SDPI, which polled 19,000-odd votes in 2014, is also in the fray. If it can make a dent in the votes in IUML strongholds, it can have adverse impact on the UDF’s kitty.  Banking on numbers The LDF calculation is that the Assembly election results in 2016 stands it in good stead. It won four of the seven Assembly segments — Taliparamba, Mattannur, Dharmadam, and Kannur — while the UDF retained Irikkur, Peravur, and Azhikode. The LDF had a total victory margin of over one lakh in the seven segments. But the voting pattern in Lok Sabha election in the constituency invariably deviated from that in Assembly elections.
Switch of YSRCP’s fan in people’s hands: Magunta|ONGOLE|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The switch of fan (the party symbol of the YSR Congress Party) is not in Hyderabad or New Delhi as contended by the ruling TDP, but in the hands of the people of the State, party nominee for Ongole Lok Sabha constituency Magunta Srinivasulu Reddy said. “It is the people who have energised the fan to propel at a greater speed to sweep the polls,” he said while addressing a gathering at an election meeting at Giddalur town in Prakasam district on Sunday. Party chief Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy was also present in the meeting. Mr. Srinivasulu Reddy furthered endeared to the huge gathering by saying, “My admirers wanted me to get down from the cycle (TDP’s symbol) which I had pedalled for five long years without proper recognition.” “Initially, I did not understand, but now I am enjoying the cool breeze of the YSRCP’s fan,” he said.


Rahul’s candidature throws up too many questions|THIRUVANANTHAPURAM|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Following Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s confirmation to contest from Wayanad, the United Democratic Front (UDF) as well as the Congress will have to strain every nerve to proffer a convincing reason in support of his decision to opt for the segment. The Left Democratic Front (LDF) will eventually toss up the soft Hindutva line being pursued by the Congress in north India and the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) has already projected the candidature as a bid to appease the minorities. The LDF has reiterated its resolve not to change its candidate P.P. Suneer, but instead bolster its campaign machinery to take on the challenge posed by Mr. Gandhi’s candidature. Mr. Suneer has completed two rounds of campaigning and has sustained its pace even as the UDF camp remains a confused lot. ‘The principal foe’ The LDF has raised a question about the principal foe that Mr. Gandhi and the Congress are fighting in the current elections and clarified that it is solely committed to unseating the NDA. Despite the best efforts of the national leaders to make it appear that the Congress is targeting the BJP, the CPI(M) and the LDF take it as a straight fight between them and the Congress itself. This may also seriously impact the bid to carve out a secular front against the NDA, sources said. The soft Hindutva line purportedly adopted by the Congress that closely resembles the BJP’s political line on cow slaughter and construction of Ram temple may also be stirred up in the course of the campaign. The accent of the NDA campaign in Wayanad and elsewhere would be on minority appeasement by the Congress. BJP State president P.S. Sreedharan Pillai said that Mr. Gandhi had conceded defeat by moving over to Wayanad, where the BJP did not have a prominent presence. The question why he chose Wayanad after skipping about 450 segments in the country, including Thiruvananthapuram and Pathanamthtita, where the BJP is a force to be reckon with, would be raised during the course of the campaign. BJP options Following the confirmation of Mr. Gandhi’s candidature, the BJP is reported to be toying with the idea of fielding a national leader in Wayanad, but it would ultimately settle for Bharath Dharma Jana Sena leader Thushar Vellappally and have a BJP nominee in Thrissur. Considering the paucity of time, the lot may fall on one of the BJP State general secretaries. The BDJS has agreed to go by the BJP national leadership’s decision and that has made the task easy too.

TDP promises Nagavali river water for Etcherla segment|SRIKAKULAM|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Minister for Energy and Telugu Desam Party State president Kala Venkata Rao on Sunday promised to provide drinking water facility for all the villages in Etcherla constituency by laying pipelines from the Nagavali river. He said that the proposal would be taken up as a top priority to help villages have ample drinking water apart from meeting the needs of industries of Pydibhimavaram industrial zone. Along with TDP candidate for Vizianagaram Lok Sabha seat Pusapati Ashok Gajapathi Raju, he toured in Kosta and other villages of Ranasthalam mandal as part of the election campaign. Thotapalli dividends He said farmers had already benefited from the early completion of the Thotapalli project on the Nagavali river. “Farmers are able to get two crops in a year. There will be a chance for three crops in future as government is keen on optimum utilisation of water resources in the district. We are going to complete distributory network very shortly to provide water for tail-end areas,” he added. Mr.Venkata Rao said that development would continue in Srikakulam and other parts of the State only when TDP was voted to power.

Jagan predicts hung Parliament|ONGOLE/NELLORE|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Predicting a hung Parliament, YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) president Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on Sunday envisaged a pivotal role for his party and the Telangana Rashtra Samiti in the formation of the next government at Centre. He expressed confidence that “the two parties will sweep the polls in the two Telugu-speaking States with the YSRCP bagging 25 and the TRS 17 MP seats each.” In the present political situation no party would be in a position to form the next government on its own, he opined, adding: “we (YSRCP and TRS) will insist on granting SCS to Andhra Pradesh in return for support to a party or parties forming the new government.” The assertion of Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy came a day after TRS working president K.T. Rama Rao stating more and more regional parties, including Trinamool Congress, Biju Janata Dal, Bahujan Samaj Party and the Samajwadi Party joining the Federal Front after the polls. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy, who addressed a series of election rallies in Gudur in Nellore district and Giddalur and Darsi in Prakasam district, accused Chief Minister N.Chandrababu Naidu of mortgaging the State’s interests by not insisting upon the SCS to protect his ‘personal interests’. The TDP government had written to the Centre against setting up of a port at Dugarajapatnam to favour a private player, he alleged. “With the coveted status, every district in the State will be developed into a Hyderabad to ensure jobs for unemployed youth in new industries,” he asserted. Amid loud cheer, Mr. Reddy said: “Babu (CM) should go and Jagan should come (to power).” Jobs for locals The YSRCP on coming to power in the State would enact a legislation to reserve 75% of jobs for the local people and within the quota 50% for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes and Minorities in the very first Assembly session itself and fill at one go over 2.30 lakh vacancies in government departments. “I have seen your sufferings during my padayatra. I have given a listening ear to your woes. I am there to take care of one and all,” he said and promised to bring smiles on the faces of each and every section of people by implementing the host of promises made during the 3,648-km walkathon. Ryots’ woes Referring to an analysis made an Independent organisation based on affidavits submitted by political party leaders which had found Mr. Naidu to be the richest Chief Minister in the country, he said in contrast a study made by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development found farmers in the State having maximum debt when compared to their counterparts elsewhere in the country. Farmers were in deep trouble as the market prices for most crops, including cotton, red gram, and bengal gram were below the minimum support price in the State. “Do we want a government that does not take care of farmers,” he asked and the assembled gathering responded to his question with a resounding ‘no’. Though Prakasam district was entitled to 60 tmcft of assured water from the river Krishna as per the Tribunal award, the Chief Minister had not ensured even 20 tmcft in any of the five years, he alleged, adding that Mr. Naidu for the sake of kickbacks had changed contractor and delayed completion of the Veligonda project even after a majority of the project works had been completed during the late YSR regime itself. Making mention of the alleged poor track record of Mr. Naidu in keeping poll promises in the last five years and in undivided Andhra pradesh in the past, he cautioned the people saying that if by mistake he was voted back to power, anarchy would prevail in the State and people’s lives would become more miserable.

Rahul, Gowda rally seeks to unite cadre|Bengaluru|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Top leaders of the coalition partners — Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Janata Dal (S) supremo H.D. Deve Gowda, and Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy — on Sunday appealed to workers of both the parties to work as one man and ensure victory of the coalition candidates in the Lok Sabha elections. The appeal comes following bickering among leaders and workers of both the parties who have expressed their dissatisfaction over the seat-sharing arrangement between the coalition partners in the State. The leaders, who held a joint poll rally to send out a unity message to the cadre of both the parties to forget their political differences, sought to remind them that their main purpose of coming together was to defeat Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP. In the first-ever joint election rally for both parties in the State, leaders attacked the BJP-led NDA at the Centre over its alleged failure to protect the interests of the poor in the last five years. Mr. Gandhi, in his nearly 15-minute speech before thousands of Congress and Janata Dal(S) workers gathered at the Parivarthana Samavesha, asked workers of both the parties to work for each other’s benefit. “Why have both parties come together? They are together to defeat the BJP,” he said. During his speech, Mr. Gandhi appealed twice to workers of both parties to work for each other’s success. Differences Acknowledging that there were differences between leaders and workers, Mr Kumaraswamy said: “There are differences in two or three constituencies [Hassan, Mandya, and Tumakuru]. But please do not make it big. I appeal to leaders and workers of both the parties [to work together].” Terming the joint election campaign as historic, Mr. Kumaraswamy said that the coalition government had been formed to send a message to the country. Mr. Deve Gowda said that as a regional party, the Janata Dal(S) would stand by the Congress in its fight against the BJP, and that they would go to every constituency to explain the reason why the parties came together. “This joint rally is to send the message again,” he said. ‘Leave the past behind’ A key leader in the coalition politics, chairman of the coalition’s coordination committee and former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah also asked the workers and leaders to forget the past. “Forget whatever happened in the past. It is the country and the State that is important now. We have forgotten all our differences to keep the communal BJP out,” he said. “It is the responsibility of those secular forces who are for democracy, protection of the Constitution and maintaining of unity and integrity of the country to come together. The message to the entire country should go from here,” he added.

Ready to hand over Wayanad seat to BJP, says Thushar|Thrissur|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|With Congress president Rahul Gandhi announcing his decision to contest from Wayanad, the NDA might consider changing its candidate in the constituency. The declaration will come on Sunday evening, BDJS leader and Thrissur NDA candidate Thushar Vellappally has said. “I have discussed the situation with the NDA leadership and BJP president Amit Shah. The decision will be announced by Sunday evening,” he told mediapersons. “If the BJP demands, the BDJS is ready to hand over the seat to it. However, if the BDJS is contesting from there, we will change the candidate,” Mr. Thushar said. A stronger candidate would be put up against Mr. Gandhi, he said. He refused to give a clear answer on whether he would move to Wayanad. But he said he was mentally prepared for any fight.

Kerala Cong. jubilant, LDF sees ‘wrong message’ in Wayanad|Thiruvananthapuram|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Congress workers in Kerala danced, burst firecrackers, and distributed sweets on Sunday to celebrate the news that their national president Rahul Gandhi would contest the Lok Sabha election from the Wayanad constituency. Mr. Gandhi’s candidature made the Left Democratic Front (LDF) see red with Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan stating that it sends a wrong message to secular forces aligned against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).   CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan echoed a similar sentiment. Mr. Gandhi’s arrival appeared to have upended the political calculations of the BJP in Kerala. It has wrested back the Wayanad seat from the Bharath Dharma Jana Sena (BDJS), a coalition partner, whose candidate Paily Vathiattu, had started campaigning last week. BJP State president P.S. Sreedharan Pillai said Mr. Gandhi appeared to be contesting the Lok Sabha on a minority appeasement plank. He hinted that the BJP would field a strong contender amidst speculation that it could be Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman or actor Suresh Gopi. IUML response Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) leader P.K. Kunhalikutty said the UDF was privileged to have the “future Prime Minister of India” in its bastion. The IUML is a dominant presence in the constituency, which has a sizeable Muslim population, an estimated 48%. Christians also form a large chunk of the electorate, and the Congress has held the constituency since its inception in 2008. The Wayanad constituency spans the districts of Wayanad, Malappuram and Kozhikode, and comprises seven Assembly segments. Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president Mullappally Ramachandran said Mr. Gandhi’s presence in Kerala would imbue the polls in Kerala with the fast-paced spirit of 20/20 cricket. “We will win all the 20 seats in Kerala,” he said.

KCR promises new revenue legislation soon|HYDERABAD|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|As a sequel to his recent stand wanting overhaul of Revenue Department to weed out corruption while talking to a farmer over telephone, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on Sunday told an election meetings of TRS in Mahabubnagar and Wanaparthy that the government would shortly enact a new revenue law in the State. He also said the Dharani portal of the government, a one-stop solution for land related issues, would be launched in June or July. Technical experts were already working on commissioning of the portal. Once launched, farmers will not face the problem of corruption in the department. “I will myself stand as the voice of farmers,” he remarked. Mr. Rao promised that he would camp in each district for three days after the Parliament elections. The problems in villages would be discussed at ‘praja darbars’ for finding lasting solutions. He thanked the people of erstwhile Mahabubnagar district, including Wanaparthy, for electing TRS candidates in 13 out of 14 constituencies in the recent Assembly elections. He reminded them that the district was vastly different after the TRS formed the government. Modi daydreaming Targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his speech at a BJP public meeting in Mahabubnagar on Thursday, Mr. Rao said Mr. Modi was daydreaming that the BJP will return to power. He predicted that the BJP-led NDA government will win 150 seats and Congress-led UPA 100 seats. Mr. Rao said even sarpanches would not talk in the tune of Mr. Modi as they were well acquainted with grassroots level requirements in villages. Mr. Modi did not speak a word about what he proposed to unveil for the development of the country in the next five years if the BJP returned to power. He reminded people that the the BJP forfeited deposit in 103 out of 118 constituencies that the party contested in Assembly elections. It will repeat its failure in 14 to 15 constituencies in Parliament elections. The prospect of TRS led federal front playing a key role in government formation at the Centre shook the political corridors in New Delhi. The TRS enjoyed the support of DMK, Prakash Ambedkar-led Bharipa Bahujan Maha Sangh and several other parties in various States.

A myopic move: Pinarayi|Thiruvananthapuram|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said the decision of the Congress to field Rahul Gandhi in Wayanad smacked of political myopia. At a meet-the-press here on Sunday, Mr. Vijayan said Mr. Gandhi's candidature had made it seem suddenly that the secular Left was the principal opponent of the Congress and not the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The Congress, which was supposedly fighting on a plank of secularism, had lost sight of its stated enemy, the Sangh Parivar. If Mr. Gandhi wanted to take the BJP head-on, he should have stuck to Amethi. ‘‘Even a child knows that in Kerala the fight is between the LDF and the UDF. The BJP is a lightweight in Kerala’s electoral politics. It has no presence in Wayanad,’’ he said. Hence, Mr. Gandhi’s electoral battle would be against the LDF primarily. Mr. Vijayan said Mr. Gandhi’s arrival had added no new dimension to the poll campaign in the State. There would be no minority consolidation in favour of the Congress. The Congress and the BJP were on the same page when it came to banning cow slaughter. The people also know that it was under the watch of the Congress that the Sangh Parivar demolished the Babri Masjid. Both parties have pursued the same financial policies that impoverished the poor and enriched the rich. NSS stance hailed He welcomed the Nair Service Society’s (NSS) stated position that it would keep an equidistance from all political parties in the Lok Sabha election. Mr. Vijayan said Sabarimala was not a poll issue. ‘‘People are talking about livelihood issues, the growing gap between the rich and the poor, farmer distress and suicides, mindless privatisation of public sector units, growing unemployment, wage stagnation, and public lynchings in the name of crow protection,’’ he said.

Farmers’ prospects in erstwhile Karimnagar dwindle|KARIMNAGAR|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Prevailing heat wave conditions and depleting groundwater levels have led to standing crops withering away in various parts of the erstwhile Karimnagar district, causing farmers to worry over their prospects. They took up large-scale cultivation of paddy based on the availability of water in SRSP (Sri Rama Sagar Project) and LMD ( Lower Manair Dam) reservoirs. But the government could not provide water to the command areas owing to reduced water levels in the reservoirs in later days. Though the government released the available water, it did not reach the tail-end farmers as it was “pilfered” by farmers in the upper region. Other irrigation sources such as wells and bore-wells were insufficient to protect the standing crops. Though farmers resorted to deepening their wells by spending large sums of money, they failed to get enough water for their entire crop area. Sources said that, as of now, each farmer has lost approximately Rs. 25,000 per acre for cultivating paddy. Rythu Ikya Vedika district president M. Venkat Reddy, who cultivated paddy in eight acres of land at Challur village in Veenavanka mandal, said the crop in his two-and-a-half acres has withered away due to non-availability of water from SRSP canals. He alleged that during the Assembly elections, the State government had released water from the SRSP for irrigation without any need for it. “Had the government released water judiciously during the last kharif, there would not have been any crisis now and the standing crops could have been protected,” he said. Demanding that the officials from the Agriculture Department visit their fields to enumerate the losses and submit a report to the State government for compensation, he urged the government to provide a compensation of Rs. 25,000 per acre to each farmer. Meanwhile, Communist Party of India (CPI) district secretary K. Ramgopal Reddy inspected the crops in Chigurumamidi mandal and interacted with farmers along with a delegation. He urged the government to take measures to enumerate losses and compensate farmers immediately.  Other irrigation sources such as wells and bore-wells were insufficient

Announcement could be a game changer|Thiruvananthapuram|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The entry of Congress president Rahul Gandhi into the fray in Wayanad could be a game changer for the Congress and the United Democratic Front (UDF). Even though the decision took its own time, it has virtually energised the rank and file of the party and neutralised factional tussles. In a minority dominated polity, Mr. Gandhi’s contest is expected to lead to a consolidation of minority votes for the UDF. One of the main problems that the Congress and the UDF have been wrangling for the last several years is the erosion of its Muslim and Christian vote banks. This was evident in the 2014 Lok Sabha election and 2016 Assembly election. The general perception that the Congress did not have a national leadership to take on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had contributed a lot to this shift in voting preference in the State. But over the years, Mr. Gandhi has emerged as a strong opponent of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. UDF leaders believe that Mr. Gandhi’s current profile will have its impact in all the 20 Lok Sabha seats. Along with the imperatives of State politics, the pressures of national politics too appear to have been influenced the choice of Wayanad. Congress leaders believe that Mr. Gandhi’s decision will have a positive impact on the party’s prospects in several south Indian States. It is obvious that Mr. Gandhi has taken the decision to contest ignoring behind-the-scene string pulling by certain forces because of the imperatives of numbers game. The party’s target is to emerge as the single largest party in the event of a hung Parliament. It cannot afford to fall short of the tally required to get the status of Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha as it did last time with a tally of 40 as against the required 55 or 10% of the total seats. A victory in Wayanad and Amethi will help Mr. Gandhi assume a pan-India image and personally stake his claim for the leadership of the national alternative against Mr. Modi, Congress leaders say.

Oust Sharma as law and order observer: TDP|VIJAYAWADA|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Taking a cue from Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee, the Telugu Desam Party has dashed off a letter to the Election Commission of India (ECI), seeking removal of K.K. Sharma as the ‘Law and Order Observer’. ‘Credentials in question’ Releasing a copy of the letter to the media on Sunday, TDP State general secretary Varla Ramaiah said Mr. Sharma was appointed as special police observer for West Bengal. “The West Bengal opposed it on the ground that Mr. Sharma had questionable credentials as he had affiliation with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). The TDP has requested the ECI to withdraw Mr. Sharma and appoint another officer with no political affiliations,” Mr. Varla Ramaiah said. The TDP had submitted a petition objecting the appointment, he added.  Meanwhile, TDP Rajya Sabha member Kanakamedala Ravindra said that ‘Modi-KCR-Jagan were the faces of the same coin’. “The YSRCP chief Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy was claiming that the Kia Motors came to the State owing to the intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. But, the fact is that the project could become a reality due to the sustained efforts of Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu and the brand image of Andhra Pradesh as an investment destination.  A dig at Mohan Babu Further, TDP MLC Buddha Venkanna urged cine actor Manchu Mohan Babu to maintain restraint while commenting on the Chief Minister. “He (Mr. Mohan Babu) has no right to comment on the Pasupu Kumkuma scheme. Mr. Mohan Babu wanted a support and that’s why he joined the YSR Congress Party,” he alleged.

‘Slum-dwellers ignored despite forming 40% of the electorate’|VISAKHAPATNAM|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|There are about 748 slums in the city, with their 9 lakh residents comprising about 40% of the total electorate in the city. Despite this large number, they continue to be a neglected lot, said former bureaucrat E.A.S. Sarma. Mr. Sarma was addressing a meeting titled ‘Our Vote-Our Future’ jointly organised by AUTD, MNSS and the National Election Forum, here on Sunday. The former bureaucrat said that every time there is an election, politicians visit the slums either to woo the slum-dwellers into their fold or to buy their votes, but never bother visiting the slums again once they are elected to power, at least for the next five years. Keeping in mind the forthcoming elections in the State, the slum-dwellers, representing over 20 major slums in the city, released a charter of demands through a ‘People’s Manifesto’ at the meeting. List of demands The manifesto, comprising 42 demands, highlighted various issues such as recognition of slum-dwellers and unorganised sector, relocation of slums within their area of livelihood, and solving issues related to housing, water and drainage. Releasing the manifesto, the slum-dwellers said that every time a candidate visits their slum asking for votes, they will be asked to sign the manifesto, in a show of promise that they would implement the demands listed by the slum-dwellers. “Apart from the 42 demands, we also want that the leaders visit the slums every three months and take stock of the implementation of our demands,” said a slum-dweller from Ambedkar Colony. “Otherwise, we will be forced to exercise the NOTA option,” she said. No housing policy Addressing the slum-dwellers, Pragada Vasu of AUTD said that as per the guidelines, all civic bodies are entitled to spend 40% of every rupee spent on slum development, but this is not being done. Mr. Vasu pointed out that the state has no housing policy for slum-dwellers and in the name of rehabilitating them, they are being moved out of the city limits, miles away from their regular income area. ‘Don’t accept money’ Talking about the sale of votes, Mr. Sarma said, “Many political parties try to lure the voters in the slums by paying them Rs. 1,000 or Rs. 2,000 per vote and a liquor packet.” The former bureaucrat advised slum-dwellers to stay away from such deals, as Rs. 1,000 per vote equalled Rs. 200 per year for the next five years, and less than Rs. 1 for the 365 days in a year.

Expenditure under watch!|KAKINADA|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Media Monitoring Committee in East Godavari district has sent shock waves among a few contestants by including Rs. 19.68 lakh towards expenditure incurred for “paid news.” After scrutinizing about 16,851 clippings, including 15,000 in newspapers, the committee classified 34 from the print media and 32 from the electronic media as “paid news.” It put the total cost at Rs. 19,68,506. “It is being done as per the guidelines issued by the Election Commission of India. These expenses will be added to the individual election expenses of the candidates concerned,” said Kartikeya Misra, district Collector and Returning Officer.

Kanna sends legal notice to Kutumba Rao for his remarks|VIJAYAWADA|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|BJP State president Kanna Lakshminarayana sent a legal notice to AP Planning Board Vice Chairman C. Kutumba Rao seeking unconditional apology for his remarks against him that he would pay Rs. 10 lakh to the BJP State president if he managed to get the deposit in the election. Mr. Rao has entitled to defamation compensation of Rs. 10 crore for his remarks that damaged the reputation and caused mental agony, torture and humiliation, he said in the notice. His counsel V. Srinivasa Raju sent the notice, a copy of it was released to the media on Sunday. The BJP leader said that Mr. Rao’s statements, challenges and offers would amount to betting in elections and violation of the Model Code of Conduct which was prohibited and also punishable. As Mr. Rao was drawing a salary from the state exchequer, he was not supposed to issue political statements and throw open challenges. He should confine himself to responsibilities like assisting the State government in the planning of economic and financial matters of the government. Also, he did not change his attitude even though the poll code was in vogue, which was highly objectionable, the BJP leader said. Mr. Rao did not follow the Election Commission rules, which clearly stipulates that no government servant shall be associated with any political activity. The rules also state that no government servant shall canvass or otherwise interfere or with use his influence in connection with taking part in an election. But, Mr. Rao, in his press conferences on March 27 and 28, had violated the rules with his open offers and claims that the TDP would get more than 125 seats while YSRC Party would not get more than 30 Assemble seats. It sent wrong signals to the voters with regard to the BJP candidates in the State, he pointed out. Claiming that he was entitled to the “damage which he had suffered” since the publication of the news and also word of mouth publicity thereafter, Mr. Lakshminarayana sought an unconditional apology in a week from Mr. Rao. Else, appropriate legal proceedings, both civil and criminal, would be initiated against without any further notice, he added.

Padayatra has endeared Jagan to people: Jayasudha|Vijayawada|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|YSR Congress Party president Y.S.Jagan Mohan Reddy has learnt about the problems of people while he was on his ‘padayatra’ and people too have developed an affection for him and want him to be the next Chief Minister, said actor Jayasudha. Addressing the media at the party’s State office here on Sunday, she said that she was totally convinced that Mr. Jagan would excel as Chief Minister. He took out the ‘padayatra’ to catch the pulse of people and he walked 3,640 km across the State. He was able not only able to catch their pulse but also capture their hearts, she said.  ‘Arogyasri wonderful scheme’ Recalling the ‘padayatra’ taken out by former Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, Ms. Jayasudha said that YSR shared with her how the ‘padayatra’ had totally changed his perspective on the troubles of the poor and that of farmers. The people were in a way obliged to give Mr Jagan a chance to be of service particularly to the poor, she said. While YSR’s Arogyasri was such a wonderful scheme that saved so many lives, the Navaratna’s of Mr Jagan were also full of merit, she said. While all Navaratna’s were important the one which supported poor students to continue their education and the one which was of support to farmers were her favourite. Ms Jayasudha said that she came to realise the key role farmers play in society only recently and now felt thoroughly indebted to them. Ms. Jayaprada said that she came back to politics to serve people. She took a break after her earlier stint as Secunderabad MLA. It was YSR who had brought her into politics, she said.

TDP will meet Congress’ fate, says G.V.L.|VIJAYAWADA|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|BJP national spokesperson G.V.L. Narasimha Rao on Sunday exuded confidence that his party, on its own, would win over 300 seats in the Lok Sabha elections. Addressing the media here, the Rajya Sabha member said this time, the battle of ballot was about Prime Minister Narendra Modi versus a “bunch of failed and disappointed leaders.” Leaders such as Rahul Gandhi, N. Chandrababu Naidu and Mamata Banjerjee were making personal remarks because of the fear of defeat, he said, adding that Mr. Rahul Gandhi now decided to contest from Kerala, where the Congress had poll understanding with the Communist parties because he was unsure about his political future. Mr. Naidu lost credibility among people who were not interested in listening to him any more. That’s precisely why he was bringing leaders from other States to campaign for his party. Demanding that the TDP president should tell people what his party had done in the last five years, Mr. Rao alleged that he was trying to take credit for the centrally-sponsored schemes. He said the TDP would witness in the State what Congress witnessed in the last general elections. ‘Youth our priority’ When it was pointed out that the BJP had ignored senior leaders like L.K. Advani, Mr. Rao asserted that “youth is the priority of BJP, and as far as Mr. Advani’s issue is concerned, it is party’s internal affair.” He said the party had complained to the Election Officer that MP candidates from regional parties in A.P. were spending nearly Rs. 70 crore in violation of the rule book. The party also wanted the poll panel to remove the State Planning Board vice-chairman Kutumba Rao from his post for overstepping the role of a bureaucrat and making political statements against the BJP.

Youth find summer jobs out of election campaigns|VIJAYAWADA|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Soon after completing the final year Intermediate public examinations about two weeks ago, Ganesh (name changed) had decided to take up the part-time job offered by an event management firm. He was supposed to be a member of a troop performing dance, which he enjoys, at parties managed by it. Basic tasks But as the pace of the election campaign picked up, he got wind of candidates hiring youngsters as foot soldiers doing basic tasks like flag bearers, activists and perform other tasks and took up one. A couple of weeks later, he now has ample pocket money which he earned by walking along different candidates in the East and the Central constituencies. Many youngsters who otherwise take up part-time summer jobs during the long holiday are into campaigning for various candidates who pay a decent amount. “I take part in the campaign in the morning and evening and am paid Rs. 400 per day. In addition, we are offered breakfast and dinner,” Ganesh says. “Though it is not a decent office job, in just 10 days I was able to earn an amount equal to what I could have at a usual part-time job in a month. Also, it is a chance to closely observe politicians.” He also roped in his friend who came back home recently after completing his apprenticeship, part of his degree course, in a far off city. Almost all candidates have been hiring youngsters on a daily basis for public meetings and door-to-door campaigns. Youngsters with motorcycles get good pay and fuel but bike rallies are not a daily feature. In one programme attended by Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu in the city, about 5,000 youth took part in such a rally, according to the announcement made by the candidate while appreciating the organisers. Disparity While the youth are paid the highest amount, women are paid the lowest, Rs. 200, depending on various factors like the duration of the programme, distance to be travelled and others. “A majority of the flag bearers do it for pay. In addition, a large number of women and men are being roped in to fill the space at meetings but are paid less,” said a member of election expenditure observer’s flying squad on condition of anonymity.

Degree college, area hospital still elude GD Nellore|CHITTOOR|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The slew of promises made by the candidates in run-up to successive elections to the Gangadhara Nellore Assembly segment, popularly known as GD Nellore, appear to have failed to translated into action if the ground reality is any indication. A closer look at this SC reserved segment paints a gloomy picture when it comes to development. Spread over GD Nellore, Sriranga Raja Puram, Vedurukuppam, Penumuru, Karveti Nagaram and Palasamudram mandals, the constituency does not even have a degree college or an area hospital. The students still depends on the Chittoor or neighbouring Puttur for pursuing intermediate education and beyond. In case of medical emergency, the people here have to rush to either Chittoor or Tirupati. With no assured source of water, farmers in the constituency bank upon the rain. With monsoon paying truant a regular phenomenon, farmers are now resorting to alternate crops as the yield of groundnut and sugarcane crops are plummeting with each passing year. Demographic divide With an electorate of close to 2 lakh, the Assembly segment has 40 % of its total voters belonging to Scheduled Caste (SC) category while less than 2% are Scheduled Tribes (STs) and the rest are the upper castes and Backward Classes (BCs). Poll pundits say that a keen contest between the sitting YSRCP MLA Kalatturu Narayanaswamy and TDP candidate A. Harikrishna, son of former Minister Gummadi Kuthuhalamma, is on the cards this time, though the Jana Sena Party, the BJP and the Congress have fielded their candidates. In 2014 elections, Mr. Narayanaswamy won, with 54.5% of the votes in his favour, while the TDP candidate could manage 41.3% of votes. The YSRCP cadres claim that that it would be a cakewalk for the party this time too. Experts suggest that the upper castes and a majority of the SC pockets are showing a tilt towards the YSRCP, leaving the BCs to sail with the TDP. The YSRCP cadres say that they have undertaken active campaigns in this segment during the last five years, taking the party’s programmes to the village level. Lingering issues On the other hand,having faced defeat in this segment, the TDP cadres have gone into an almost ‘silent mode’ and resurfaced just six months ago. Some TDP activists also admit that GD Nellore was least visited by Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu or other Ministers since 2014 when compared to the other constituencies in Chittoor district. With no substantial development works to hang onto, the TDP cadres are banking on the schemes such as hike in social pensions and the promise of unemployment dole. Voters also allege that the TDP has not taken any tangible measures to address the housing and agrarian issues. Caste factor A few years ago, the attacks on the Dalits at Pachikapallam in Vedurukuppam mandal became a weapon for the YSRCP, which was said to have prompted the victim groups to turn to them, throwing the blame on a section of the upper castes. The village hogged the limelight when participation of the Dalits in the Mahabharatam event and the rituals at a local temple was opposed, triggering a row. Though the district administration could settle the issue amicably, the embers appear to cool down yet. Sitting MLA and YSCP nominee K. Naraynaswamy is confident of his win, subbing it as a ‘foregone conclusion’. “We have been moving with the people of every nook and corner of the segment. We know them and their problems better than anybody else,” he says. Rural infrastructure TDP candidate Harikrishna, who is said to be enjoying a considerable clout not only in the SC pockets, but also in the other areas. He is banking on the goodwill of his mother Gummadi Kuthuhalamma. During his electioneering, he is seen convincing the voters and making promises to address the prime issues. “All sections of the people in this constituency are happy with the welfare schemes introduced by the TDP government, especially the measures initiated to address the issues of farmers and social pension benefeciaries. Focus on rural infrastructure is my priority,” he says.

Naidu has left farmers in the lurch: Sharmila|GUNTUR|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Alleging that the TDP government had left the farmers in the State in the dire straits, YSRCP leader Y.S Sharmila on Sunday said that Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu had never campaigned on his own for any election. “Before 2014 elections, he joined hands with the NDA . And now, he had tied up with the Congress and has begun importing Chief Ministers and former Chief Ministers from other States to campaign for him,” Mr. Sharmila said while addressing meetings at Narsaraopet and Pedakurapadu. Highlighting that the YSRCP had always fought elections on its own, Ms. Sharmila said that Mr. Naidu was propagating that the YSRCP had joined hands with the BJP and the TRS. “It was Mr. Naidu who had a four-year honeymoon with the BJP and explored the possibility of having an alliance with the TRS ,” she said. Unemployment She said the TDP chief was growing richer as the farmers had been suffering. The unemployment has nearly doubled in the the last five years,” Ms. Sharmila alleged. Stating that the YSRCP would support only those parties which would promise Special Category Status (SCS) to the State, she said welfare was the watchword for the party.

‘I bank on my performance alone’|VISAKHAPATNAM|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|TDP candidate for the Araku Lok Sabha constituency and former Union Minister V. Kishore Chandra Deo does not believe in seeking votes or making promises at the time of elections. “I bank on my image and performance as an elected representative and it is up to people whether to vote for me or not,” he says. Stating that the clearances to bauxite mining leases could be put on hold during UPA-II due to pressure mounted by him on the Congress leadership during his stint as Minister for Tribal Welfare and Panchayat Raj, he said he was impressed with the decision of Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu to scrap the GO on leases as soon as the TDP formed the government post-bifurcation. “Apart from the development carried out by Mr. Naidu, his bold decision to cancel the lease agreement signed by APDMC with some companies was one of the main reasons for my decision to join the TDP after resigning from the Congress,” Mr. Deo toldThe Hindu. He said: “I have a long association with the TDP. I was in Congress (S) then and worked as National Front parliamentary party secretary along with late Murasoli Maran of the DMK.” Forest Rights Bill Mr. Deo, who was elected to the Lok Sabha five times and the Rajya Sabha once, said Mr. Naidu had played a key role in continuing the crusade against the NDA government headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. As the Chairman of the Joint Select Committee, he made a strong recommendation for enactment of the Forest Rights Bill during UPA-I. He said in UPA-II, he played a crucial role in the formulation of the Panchayat Extension in Scheduled Areas (PESA) Act and the Forest Rights Act. Mr. Deo said under the Integrated Action Plan for LWE-affected areas, he was instrumental in including Visakhapatnam, East Godavari, Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, Khammam and Adilabad districts as a result of which they received Rs. 30 crore per year for three years. Another contribution, he pointed out, was the sanction of Rs. 1,700 crore to Scheduled Areas under Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana. Araku and Paderu alone were sanctioned Rs. 600 crore.  Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu played a key role in continuing the crusade against the NDA government headed by Narendra Modi V. Kishore Chandra Deo

Pensioners pledge support to Naidu|VIJAYAWADA|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|AP Pensioners Associations’ Federation has extended its support to Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu and has been campaigning in support him. Federation president G. Purna Chandra Rao said the TDP government had the support of four lakh pensioners. “All the promises made by TDP in 2014 have been fulfilled, benefiting all the pensioners,” he said. The government allowed the family of a deceased employee to avail huge financial support in a single payment if his-her kin is ineligible to take up a job through compassionate appointment, he added. “Besides, the government also offered 25% fare concession to pensioners in RTC buses,” he said.

Four-cornered contest on the cards|VISAKHAPATNAM|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Visakhapatnam Lok Sabha constituency, the biggest in the State, has been favourable to non-local candidates in the past. In 2014, a Modi-TDP wave, aided by the endorsement of actor Pawan Kalyan’s newly-formed Jana Sena Party, resulted in an impressive victory for incumbent BJP MP K. Haribabu, who lives here. However, his nearest rival was Y.S. Vijayamma, the then honorary president of YSRCP who hails from Kadapa. The current election promises to be a rare four-cornered fight between the TDP, BJP, YSRCP and the JSP. Though the TDP, YSRCP and JSP have fielded candidates who are relatively new to politics, a strong contest is on the cards as all candidates are prominent in their own way. TDP bets on legacy Stanford-educated M. Sri Bharat seeks to inherit the political legacy of his grandfather M.V.V.S. Murthi, who was elected as MP from Visakhapatnam twice and was a leading TDP leader right from the party’s inception. With an outsider’s perspective on politics, he injects a dose of joie de vivre to the contest in a constituency that is being aggressively promoted as an IT destination and a tourism hub. Senior leaders contesting in all the Assembly constituencies should stand Mr. Bharat in good stead. JSP springs a surprise Jana Sena Party sprang a surprise by announcing the nomination of former CBI Joint Director V.V. Lakshminarayana, a rank outsider to politics in general and the constituency in particular. Mr. Lakshminarayana asserts that he would continue to live in Visakhapatnam even after the election were over. With the issue of corruption in public life taking centre stage, the man who helmed the CBI investigation into allegations of financial wrongdoings against YSRCP president Jaganmohan Reddy adds a new dimension to an already-tense contest. BJP fields familiar face With incumbent MP Mr. Haribabu ‘opting out’ of the race this time, the BJP roped in former Union Minister D. Purandeswari, who had successfully contested in 2009. She is banking on development done during her stint as MP and is campaigning on the back of welfare schemes launched by the Central government, but faces a tough challenge under an anti-BJP onslaught by the TDP. Ms. Purandeswari lists the airport getting international status and night-landing facilities, justice to people displaced by the Visakhapatnam Port and the merger of BHPV-BHEL among her achievements. YSRCP goes local YSRCP, meanwhile, has fielded builder M.V.V. Satyanarayana as its MP nominee. Mr. Satyanarayana, the party’s Lok Sabha coordinator for the past few months and also a film producer, is testing the political waters for the first time, much like his TDP and JSP counterparts. Several Assembly coordinators appointed by YSRCP have been retained as Assembly nominees, giving Mr. Satyanarayana an organisational advantage. Congress faces revolt Congress named its State Women’s Wing president P. Ramani Kumari as LS nominee, much to the disappointment of its trade union wing INTUC. Ms. Ramani Kumari is banking Rahul Gandhi’s assurance on SCS.

Naidu warns public against voting for YSRCP|KAKINADA|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Calling upon the people not to cast their vote to the Opposition YSR Congress Party, Chief Minister and TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu on Sunday alleged that the State would become a hub of anti-social elements if the YSRCP was voted to power in the elections. “Leader of the Opposition Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy is behind the torching of Ratnachal Express train on the sidelines of the Kapu Aikya Garjana public meeting. Do you want to cast your vote for his party?” Mr. Naidu asked the public while addressing a public meeting on the Rajah Grounds at Tuni. Foreseeing a pro-TDP wave all over the State, Mr. Naidu said that it would be difficult for the YSRCP candidates to get their deposits. “I have distributed ‘Pauspu-Kumkuma’ to one crore women and fulfilled all the promises made to the Kapus. Justice has been rendered to the BCs by way of 5% reservations and the farmers are benefitfed from the loan waiver,” he said, exuding confidence that all those sections would cast their vote only to the TDP. Mr. Naidu said that the youngsters were happy with the increased employment opportunities and more and more jobs would be generated in the days to come. “Both the YSRCP and the BJP are trying to hatch a conspiracy against me. But, I have no worries, as I am enjoying your full support. You should teach a lesson to Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, who is trying to involve in our State issues,” he said. Ridicules Jagan on Kia Special Correspondent from Visakhapatnam adds: Mr. Naidu has said that he has no objection to Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy being subservient to Prime Minister Narendra Modi but will not tolerate if the YSRCP chief deceives Andhra Pradesh. Referring to the statements of Mr. Reddy that Mr. Modi was responsible for setting up of Kia Motors at Anantapur, Mr. Naidu said the YSRCP chief was trying to please the Prime Minister in a bid to escape from the CBI cases pending against him. Taking credit for the tremendous growth of the IT sector in Hyderabad, Mr. Naidu said that he had the vision to develop Visakhapatnam, Kakinada, Rajamahendravaram, Eluru on similar lines. A beautiful four-lane beach road could be developed from Itchapuram in Srikakulam district to Tada in Nellore district. “Once the road is developed, the world will come to us. Investments will pour in and employment can be generated,” he said speaking on his vision to develop the State. Referring to the appeal of the YSRCP chief to the voters to give him a chance, Mr. Naidu asked the crowd: “Can we place our future at his feet?” Shall we vote for him to save him from going to jail?”

S.P.Y. Reddy perseveres|Kurnool|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Nandyal MP S.P.Y. Reddy resisted the pressure from Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu and local leaders to withdraw his nomination, making it a three-way contest in the constituency. At a public meeting in Nandyal, Mr. Naidu regretted that Mr. Reddy had left the party and joined the JSP despite offering MLC ticket to one of his family members. “Mr. Reddy’s family would be taken care of,” he said. The MP had won the constituency three consecutive times (twice Congress and once YSRCP), and has a substantial pull in the region. Party district president Somisetty Venkateswarlu toldThe Hinduthat they had tried their best to convince Mr. Reddy. “We should wait and see what happens.” Observers rubbish the TDP argument saying it did not give Mr. Reddy due respect. After winning on YSRCP ticket, he moved over to the TDP. The YSRCP supporters say the party would not be affected in any manner.

Will move HC against EC, says K.A. Paul|VIJAYAWADA|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Praja Santhi Party (PSP) chief K.A. Paul has said that he will move the High Court against the ‘injustice meted out to his party whose election Form A and Form B were stolen and the nominations were filed by unknown candidates supported by the TDP and the YSRCP. Mr. Paul demanded the resignation of Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora and postponement of the elections in A.P. . He alleged that the Election Commission had given helicopter symbol for some independent candidates in the State though the PSP holds the same symbol. He said the PSP filed nominations in 75 Assembly and 10 Parliamentary constituencies and most of them have been rejected . “B-forms (of PSP) given by other candidates have been accepted. All this was done by the Election Commission under the pressure of Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu,” Mr. Paul alleged. He accused Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy of colluding with the Election Commission for withholding PSP’s symbol.

Students demand quality educational institutions, growth in software jobs|VISAKHAPATNAM|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|With the general and Assembly elections round the corner, students from the Visakhapatnam region demand more quality educational institutions and growth in IT jobs. They say they need a government which can bring an end to the culture of going abroad seeking better jobs and wages. More medical colleges, innovation centres and safety of girl students are among a few other demands. Students from various engineering colleges say they want to see renowned IT companies in Vizag similar to the Hitech city in Hyderabad. They say they are forced to migrate to IT cities in other States in search of jobs. ‘Bring in ace companies’ “The State government has been claiming of making Visakhapatnam as IT-hub. Even now, if we seek some good software job with a good package, we need to move to Hyderabad, Chennai or Bengaluru. The next government should create more IT jobs in Vizag by bringing ace companies,” said P Ramya, a B.Tech final year student from a renowned college, Madhurwada. A few students also said several engineering colleges running without providing quality education must be shut down. They say such colleges are spoiling the future of the students who are rendered not competitive enough. “It is a fact the government has failed to provide employment to youngsters. If the politicians do a reality check they would realise that B.Tech, PG and degree students are moving around insurance offices, data-entry BPOs at Assilmetta, Siripuram etc. I have been working as a food delivery boy after finishing B.Tech three years ago,” said Ch. Kiran, working for a renowned online company. M. Vandana, a student from GITAM, said: “Rather than moving to other countries, we should get jobs better than those over here.” Intermediate a tough phase A few students said Intermediate education was the most difficult phase after they opted to study in private colleges. There should be special teams to monitor the education, academic activities in private Intermediate colleges and stop student suicides, stress or academic pressures. Several students also said the new government should take steps to set up innovation centres on campuses where students can come under one roof and discuss their ideas. A separate time table has to be maintained by the colleges and the government should monitor it, said M. Suresh, a student from a renowned private degree college at MVP Colony. Girl students also expressed the need for their safety. “We have seen attacks on girls at several places in the State. The SHE teams have to strengthened and more measures need to be taken,” said M Janaki, a student from the Arts department, Andhra University.

‘A crucial election for State’|VISAKHAPATNAM|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Jana Sena Party president Pawan Kalyan has said that the ruling TDP and the opposition YSRCP will continue to exploit the people of Andhra Pradesh, if the JSP does not exist. Addressing the party workers in the Gajuwaka Assembly constituency from where he is contesting, the actor-turned-politician said on Sunday: “These elections are very crucial for the State.” “There must be a third alternative, otherwise people will not get justice. That is what happening in the Rayalaseema region as the ruling and the opposition parties are colluding and robbing people of their money in 60:40 ratio,” he said. The JSP chief said the same trend would continue if the two-party system continues. “Leaders like Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao say that the vote percentage of the JSP is just 1 %. In such a case, why YSRCP leader Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy is criticising the JSP and why TDP leaders prevented him from visiting Srikakulam on Saturday,” he questioned. Call for clean politics Staff Reporter from Srikakulam adds: Mr. Pawan Kalyan alleged that a few families were dominating the political scene in Srikakulam and they were not allowing others to enter the field. The party allotted tickets to intellectuals and retired officials in the district, he said, adding that it was the right time for the people to vote the JSP for clean politics and fast development of the North Andhra region. Mr. Pawan Kalyan, who addressed public meetings in Palasa and Srikakulam, alleged that all the parties ignored the real issues in the district. “I always respect the people of Srikakulam since they are innocent and hard working. They never raise voice on their issues. That is why, I request the people to vote for the JSP and its representatives will fight for solution to their issues,” he said. Highlighting the party’s manifesto, Mr. Pawan Kalyan promised to transfer Rs. 3,500 per month to the accounts of all white ration card holders instead of supplying essential commodities.

Modi trying to derive mileage out of Pulwama attack: D. Raja|VISAKHAPATNAM|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|CPI national secretary D. Raja has said that the time has come for people to defeat the BJP at the Centre, the TDP in Andhra Pradesh and to elect the JSP, CPI, CPI(M) and BSP combine, which represents the genuine aspirations of them. Addressing the media here on Sunday, Mr. Raja said that ever since Mr. Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister, he has been making systematic efforts to undermine the secular and democratic fabric of India. He alleged that secularism was under attack with mob lynchings and continuing attacks on adivasis and minorities. Disinvestment of PSUs, fall in rupee value, dismantling of the Planning Commission and replacing it with Niti Aayog have all left the economy in a shambles. At a time when the Left parties were fighting for education, healthcare and employment for all, the Niti Aayog was planning to privatise everything. He wondered as to what happened to the promises of two crore jobs and bringing back black money from abroad. Describing the last four plus years as ‘misrule’ and ‘mis-governance’ of the Modi government, he said Mr. Modi’s slogans were nothing but rhetoric to mislead the public. Alleging that Mr. Modi and Mr. Amit Shah were desperate to come back to power, he said they were intimidating the media in the name of national security in a bid to create fear psychosis. He also alleged that Mr. Modi was politicising the Pulwama incident and trying to gain mileage out of the sacrifices made by the armed forces. ‘Mood has changed’ Mr. Raja said that the mood of the people has changed and they were prepared to go against Mr. Modi and the RSS. He appealed to the people to vote for a secular, alternative and democratic force. CPI State secretary K. Ramakrishna, former MLA Maanam Anjaneylu and CPI-JSP nominee for Visakhapatnam West constituency J.V. Satyanarayana Murthy spoke.

‘Naidu has pushed A.P. into debt trap’|VIZIANAGARAM|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Former Minister Botcha Satyanarayana on Sunday alleged that Chief Minister N.Chandrababu Naidu had put Andhra Pradesh in a debt trap and made people’s lives miserable. He said he was voted to power in 2014 elections just because of his previous experience as a Chief Minister. Addressing a media conference here on Sunday, he alleged that people had preferred Mr.Chandrababu Naidu to YSRCP president Y.S.Jagan Mohan Reddy in the previous election but the former had used all his experience to benefit his TDP leaders and cadre at the cost of the State’s development. He alleged that Rs. 6 lakh crore funds were misused and the A.P. government was forced to pay huge interest with debts crossing Rs. 2 lakh crore in the last four and a half years. “Now people are repenting for making him as Chief Minister. Now, they are eager to see Mr.Jagan Mohan Reddy as the Chief Minister and ensure massive victory for YSRCP in all 13 districts, including Vizianagaram,” he said. Mr.Satyanarayana, who is contesting from Cheepurupalli on YSRCP ticket, hoped that the YSRCP’s vote bank would go up 60% this time. “Last time, the vote margin was very slight between YSRCP and TDP. The TDP could get only 6.01 lakh votes extra compared to YSRCP. Now, our party is expected to get comfortable majorities in all the seats,” he added. ‘CM provoked TRS’ Mr.Satyanarayana alleged that the TDP was trying to show Mr.Jagan in poor light by citing ‘false’ cases. “Chief Minister N.Chandrababu Naidu should seek votes on his performance. But he is trying to mislead people by linking YSRCP with TRS and BJP. In fact, his party had an alliance with BJP at the Centre. He himself provoked TRS on various issues. Naturally, TRS reacts sharply. It does not mean that YSRCP has an understanding with TRS,” he said.  ‘Will bag majority seats’ He hoped that the party would win a majority of the 34 Assembly segments in North Andhra and the region would play a key role in ensuring formation of a YSRCP government in Andhra Pradesh. “All our MP candidates of North Andhra region are also expected to win the election with a massive majority. All the elected MPs did nothing to the region in the last five years,” he alleged.

‘Only Cong. can ensure SCS for A.P.’|VIZIANAGARAM|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Congress national president and prime ministerial candidate Rahul Gandhi alone would be able to give the Special Category Status (SCS) and ensure speedy development of the State, said the party candidates who campaigned in the city on Sunday.

Outline of Congress manifesto today|Hyderabad|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|AICC president Rahul Gandhi’s first visit to Telangana on Monday after the election schedule is announced to address three public meetings in three districts will unveil the outline of the party’s manifesto. Mr. Gandhi will start off with a meeting at Zaheerabad followed by a meeting at Wanaparty in the Nagarkurnool constituency and, later in the evening, at Huzurnagar in Nalgonda constituency, where TPCC president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy is trying his luck to get into the Lok Sabha for the first time. Mr. Gandhi will give a full thrust to his pet scheme — Minimum Income Guarantee scheme — at these meetings, according to Congress leaders. TPCC Treasurer Gudur Narayan Reddy said Mr. Gandhi had already unveiled a few major schemes like ‘Nyay’ (Nyuntam Aay Yojna) which aimed to provide Rs. 72,000 annually to poorest of poor families across the country. He said the scheme would benefit more than 50 lakh poor people in Telangana apart from boosting economy in the rural areas. Mr. Gandhi was expected to unveil a roadmap for transformation of the agriculture sector by helping farmers in the right manner, he said. Meanwhile, Congress leaders visited all the three venues to finalise the arrangements where they expect thousands of people to participate. R. C. Khuntia, AICC incharge for Telangana, said Mr. Gandhi did not believe in sending negative vibes but positive thoughts with new schemes that would change the election campaigning mode itself.

Rain relief for scorched State|HYDERABAD|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Several parts of the State received a good amount of showers accompanied by lightning and thunder on Sunday, bringing respite from the prevailing heat conditions. Thundershowers might be witnessed in April and May too, said officials of Hyderabad Meteorological Centre. Director in-charge of India Meteorological Department (Hyderabad) Y.K. Reddy said when ground gets heated up, air becomes light and moves upwards. “Humidity in it condenses leading to formation of clouds. The more the heat difference, the faster air moves up forming cumulonimbus clouds, which leads to thunderstorms. Such changes in weather conditions are common in April and May,” he said. On Sunday, thunderstorms lasted for a few minutes and were followed by heavy rain along with gusty winds. It started to rain from late afternoon in northern parts of the State. The clouds moved to Hyderabad and continued to head towards southern districts. Those out on roads were caught unawares and were seen scurrying for cover. The Meteorological Centre predicted thunder storms with gusty winds and lightning in Karimnagar, Warangal, Rangareddy, Hyderabad, Mahbubnagar, Vikarabad, Nagarkurnool and others districts on Monday. Earlier on Sunday, highest temperature of 42.3 degrees C was recorded in Adilabad, followed by 42.1 degrees C in Nizamabad. Hyderabad recorded 40.9 degrees C.  Thundershowers might be witnessed in April and May too. Y.K. Reddy, Director in-charge of IMD-Hyderabad

Peeping into the past through the ‘property of a gentleman’|HYDERABAD|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|An exhibition of postal stamps, envelopes, documents and photographs of the Nizam era held at New Delhi recently was a journey into the past not only for history lovers and inquisitive minds ready to peep into the bygone era at any given opportunity but also for descendants of the last and seventh Nizam, Mir Osman Ali Khan. The exhibition with the theme of ‘Property of a Gentleman – Stamps from the Nizam of Hyderabad’s Dominions’ was organised jointly by The Gujral Foundation and Guli Art Foundation at Bikaner House from March 9 to 24 with the collection from the Ewari family. The kin of the seventh Nizam, including one of his grandsons Nawab Najaf Ali Khan, who visited the exhibition along with other family members, were all praise for the Ewari family for their prized collection. Mr. Najaf Ali Khan said the collection comprised a selection of stamps originating from the erstwhile Hyderabad State during the Nizam’s rule. “The philately and other collection has a deep personal connect with Hyderabad,” he said, adding that the genesis of the expansive collection was the legacy of Nawab Iqbal Hussain Khan, the Post Master General in the Government of Nawab Mir Osman Ali Khan Bahadur Nizam VII. First adhesive stamp In all, the Ewari collection includes three million stamps from across the world, including the rare Penny Black, the first adhesive postage stamp in the world. It also featured every single stamp in the chronology of the senior most princely state of colonial India, Hyderabad. “The Asaf Jahi rule with Hyderabad as its headquarters issued its own stamps for almost 80 years from 1869 to 1949 till it joined the Indian Union,” Mr. Najaf Ali Khan explained. Against the present day advanced technology in communication, postage stamps were the indispensable remnants of the bygone era. The seemingly insignificant pieces of paper played an essential role as payment to help transfer messages, to facilitate revenue collection, taxation and other fiscal purposes, he noted. Historic value “Thanks to the organisers, who created such an ambience that immediately drew us in and we felt transported to the era of such royalty, it was a mesmerising experience. The dimly-lit huge landscapes of structural marvels of Hyderabad and custom-made lead boxes housing the stamps added to the beauty of the collection. We thank the Ewari family for preserving these priceless and alluring exhibits of historic value,” Mr. Najaf Ali Khan said.  The ambience immediately drew us in and we felt transported to the era of royalty. Nawab Najaf Ali Khan, A grandson of seventh Nizam

No cakewalk for TDP in Polavaram|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Polavaram project has been drawing national attention ever since the Modi government announced it as a national project. The Telugu Desam Party is leaving no stone unturned to showcase it as a model of commitment, development and progress achieved by the State government. Yet the TDP is facing a formidable challenge from the YSRCP in the Polavaram (ST) Assembly constituency for various reasons. The issues of the R&R package and compensation to the families that were displaced are evidently playing spoilsport. The electors are up in arms against the government over “inordinate delay” in extending the compensation to the project victims. As many as 134 villages would be submerged due to the project. The housing schemes launched by the State government for the project displaced families in these villages are yet to be completed. In some cases, the works came to a grinding halt after foundation was constructed. Bickering in TDP camp  The CPI(ML) New Democracy, which has been mobilising the tribal people against the project, has fielded its candidate Dharmula Suresh. Also, the Telugu Desam is facing internal bickering. The party has been forced to change the sitting MLA Mudiyam Srinivasa Rao and nominate B. Srinivasulu. A group opposing the renomination of the sitting MLA staged a protest in front of the Chief Minister‘s residence during the review meetings. Though the party has conceded to the demand to change the candidate, there is lack of coordination and cooperation. At an election preparatory meeting conducted in the constituency, the TDP leaders repeatedly say that every worker has to honour the party supremo decision and work for the success of the contesting candidate. Not much bonhomie was seen when Mr. Srinivasulu arrived at the venue. Voter awareness is high in the constituency. In the 1999 election, the constituency witnessed a keen contest. TDP candidate Vanka Srinivasa Rao won the seat with a wafer-thin majority of 24 votes. NOTA  In the last elections, the TDP candidate secured 15,720 votes more than his nearest rival Tellam Balaraj of YSRCP, who was the sitting MLA then. The YSRCP has chosen Mr. Balraj again. The None of the Above (NOTA) was also high as 1.06% voters preferred NOTA. The constiteuncy witnessed 14 elections, including one by-election since 1955. The Telugu Desam won five times, while the Congress and Congress (I) won seven times. The CPI secured the seat in 1962. The constituency was declared ST constituency in 1967. Mudiyam Lakshmana Rao, TDP candidate, who won the elections in 1983 and 1985, is a relative of the sitting MLA.

SNIPPET?|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST| “To vote is your right, and exercise it judiciously and without fail.” With this as their theme, about 2,000 IIIT students from Nuzvid and Srikakulam campuses took out an awareness walk in Nuzvid on Sunday, appealing to the electorate to exercise their franchise. Sub Collector Swapnil Dinkar flagged off the walk on the campus. Dressed in a special attire, the participants walked through the lanes and bylanes of the town raising slogans on the need to vote. IIIT Nuzvid Director D. Suryachandra Rao and his Srikakulam counterpart Harasreeramulu participated.

Few takers for TSRTC’s electric buses|HYDERABAD|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Nearly a month after its launch, the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC)’s fleet of electric buses seems to have generated a lukewarm response, with the occupancy ratio hovering around 20-25%. The BYD-Olectra fleet of 40 e-buses was launched in the first week of March at the Miyapur–2 Bus Depot. While 20 e-buses will be operated from here, another 20 have been ferrying passengers from the Jubilee Bus Station by means of the Cantonment Depot. “The occupancy is a little low — 20% to 25%. Having said that, more time is required to comment on the popularity or performance of the e-buses. Steps will soon be taken to give more publicity to our initiative of zero emission transportation. As it is, we are trying to give passengers the best commute as each e-bus makes four trips to the airport and reaches the ramp of at the airport,” says a senior TSRTC official.  The official said that along several routes to the airport, the e-buses have either replaced or augmented Volvo and Marcopolo buses. For instance, the JBS to RGIA via Secretariat route now has 10 e-buses which have replaced the six Volvo buses. Similarly, JNTU to RGIA now has 16 e-buses. While there were five Volvo buses and three Marcopolo buses plying on the BHEL to RGIA route, it now has seven Volvo buses and four e-buses. All the six Marcopolo buses have been replaced on the Mahatma Gandhi Bus Station to RGIA route by six new e-buses. Commuters, too, have noted that the e-buses carry few passengers. S.R. Chaitanya, who recently travelled by e-bus, says the TSRTC should make greater efforts to publicise the non-polluting buses and efforts should be made to reduce the fare. “The RTC should publicise the availability of these e-buses in the IT corridor. Further, we can see that some times, the stops for these e-buses are different from regular ones. Concerted efforts must be made to identify stops which are closer to public movement. Also, I believe the fare of these e-buses should not be more than Rs. 200. That way, there will be more takers,” he says.  More time is required to comment on the popularity or performance of e-buses. Steps will soon be taken to give more publicity to zero emission transportation.

Decision on tie-up today, says Dikshit|NEW DELHI|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Delhi Congress president Sheila Dikshit on Sunday said that an official announcement about whether the party will have an alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi would be announced on Monday. She did not divulge any other information as she met scores of people who had come to wish at her residence on her birthday. “You will get to know about it in a few hours, by this evening or by tomorrow [Monday]. There will be an official announcement,” she told reporters outside her residence. Late-night meeting Those monitoring the developments closely were left waiting as there was no official announcement with a senior Congress leaders, however, saying that Congress president Rahul Gandhi was yet to take a decision. Speculation that the Congress had arrived at a decision started after a late-night meeting was held on Saturday at Ms. Dikshit’s residence that was attended by All India Congress Committee in-charge of Delhi P.C. Chacko and senior Congress leader K.C. Venugopal. Both leaders did not comment on the purpose of the meeting but Congress sources say that the meeting was called to discuss the names of candidates for the seven Lok Sabha seats if the Congress fights it out alone. Sources said that alliance talks had hit a roadblock with both parties not agreeing on the seat-sharing formula. The Aam Aadmi Party has already announced its list of seven candidates and the BJP is expected to announce its candidates this week.

Deadline lapses but water still scarce|GATTAPALLI KOLAMGUDA (ADILABAD DIST.)|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|It is difficult even for the glib-talking politicians to convince the aboriginal Kolam people at the remote Gattapalli Kolamguda that water is flowing in the Mission Bhagiratha pipeline seen in their tiny village. “If it is flowing, why are we not getting it,” Kodapa Maruthi, a village elder wondered when someone did try telling him that during a campaign visit lately. The 22 house habitation of the Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group of Kolams in Indervelli mandal of Adilabad district, part of Adilabad (ST) Lok Sabha constituency, is among those that are yet to receive clean and safe drinking water through taps under the Telangana State Drinking Water Grid, or Mission Bhagiratha, though the deadline set by the State Government for completing the work lapsed on Sunday. “Leaders promise to look into our difficulties every time but want us to raise the demand only after we have voted for their candidate,” revealed Kodapa Mutha, of the politicians’ effort to skirt the issue. The Adivasis now drink the muddied water from a couple of open wells which were incompletely dug by an NGO close to their village. “There is no alternative,” Mr. Mutha observed resignedly when asked if there is another safer source of water. Some children in the village have been falling ill since the last few days perhaps due to unclean water which is not boiled before drinking. The health situation could worsen if the cause of illness among children is not found out soon. Officials assert that of the 116 habitations which were targeted for linking to the Mission Bhagiratha supply, as many as 112 are getting water as on the date of end of deadline. “There was water flowing for a little while one day in this pipeline about a month back but that was all we have seen of Mission Bhagiratha water,” recalled Mr. Maruthi. In fact other villages lying on the over 10-km. stretch of road from Indervelli mandal are not receiving Grid water either. “We are mechanically drawing water from the open well,” pointed out Athram Bhagwanth Rao, the patel or village headman of Sakra (K). Almost all remote hilly villages in the agency areas of former united Adilabad, including those that lie on the route to the historic Jodeghat in Kerameri mandal of Kumram Bheem Asifabad district, continue to face drinking water shortage.

AAP’s metro campaign rakes up issue of statehood|New Delhi|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The AAP on Sunday launched a campaign in the national capital under which party members distributed letters from Chief Minster Arvind Kejriwal to Delhi Metro commuters on the issue of full statehood. The campaign was launched at Rajiv Chowk metro station and would soon cover all other metro stations in the city, AAP Delhi convener Gopal Rai said. AAP volunteers will be distributing these letters outside metro stations so that commuters can read them to understand the importance of full statehood for Delhi, the senior leader also said. Mr. Rai claimed that the people of Delhi pay Rs. 1.5 lakh crore as income tax and receive only Rs. 325 crore from the Centre. “Once Delhi becomes a full State, it would get Rs. 60,000 crore, which can be used in so many development projects,” he said. Meanwhile, the Delhi unit of the Congress on Saturday lodged a complaint with the Chief Electoral Officer against Chief Minister and AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal, accusing him of misusing his office by sending letters to voters and violating the poll code. The ruling AAP in the city is fighting the Lok Sabha election on the agenda of granting full statehood to Delhi. The election to the seven Lok Sabha seats in the national capital will be held on May 12.

Ours is organic alliance, not mahamilawat: Owaisi|HYDERABAD|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|MIM president Asaduddin Owaisi took a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said the TRS-MIM alliance is not ‘mahamilawat’, but completely organic. Mr. Owaisi was addressing a public meeting at Ahmednagar in Secunderabad parliamentary constituency on Sunday where he was joined by TRS candidate from Secunderabad, Talasani Sai Kiran Yadav, and TRS MLC M.S. Prabhakar Rao. “This is a Dalit leader. Our brother here is OBC, a Yadav. All three oppressed are standing together: asherwani,a Dalit and Yadav. This Modi says ismahamilawat.No, Mr. Modi. This is organic,” he said as he was campaigned for Mr. Yadav.

Driving home the road safety message|Hyderabad|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|A bike rally to promote road safety and use of helmet was flagged off by Additional Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Anil Kumar here on Sunday. The rally was carried out by ‘Royal Wanderlust’, a group of enthusiastic Royal Enfield riders, who joined hands with the Hyderabad traffic police for the cause. The bullet riders were trained at Traffic Training Institute, Goshamahal, on creating traffic awareness among citizens. Before flagging off the rally, Mr. Kumar interacted with over 40 bullet riders and reiterated the use of helmet by both riders and pillion riders. He also presented commendation certificates to them. The bike rally passed through Ranigunj, Tank Bund, Khairatabad, Punjagutta, Banjara Hills, Jubilee Hills Checkpost, Filmnagar, Tolichowki, Masab Tank, and returned back to Peoples’ Plaza.

Why Arvind Kejriwal failed to strike a chord|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu brought in his ‘friend’ Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal all the way from the national capital to the district recently for election campaigning. Mr. Kejriwal, along with Mr. Naidu, took part in about four public meetings and rallies in and around the city. But his presence appeared to have created a little impact on the people due to the language problem. There was no designated translator. He spoke at all the meetings in Hindi, lambasting PM Narendra Modi and endorsing Mr. Naidu. What caught the attention of the crowd when he spoke was the names Mr. Naidu, YSRCP chief Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and PM Narendra Modi. Lack of sufficient time also forced him to conclude his speeches in a few minutes.  During poll campaigns, almost all the party leaders are announcing unlimited sops to woo the voters. The contestants are promising some scheme or the other to women, children, the aged and the unemployed. Some leaders are promising free medical aid, some free education and a contestant free financial aid for marriages. However, voters are wondering why the contestants are not referring to the unfulfilled promises such as construction of the Capital, the Special Category Status and others.  Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu, known for his long-winded speeches, evidently disappointed the electors in the Vijayawada (West) Assembly constituency. His election convoy whizzed past the Panja Centre in less than a minute at 7.30 pm though the people were waiting there from 5 p.m., the scheduled time for the public meeting. As the party election songs were heard from vehicles fitted with high decibel loudspeakers, the people poured in within no time. But to their dismay, Mr. Naidu, who was wearing a karakul hat, greeted them from the top of the vehicle. The public meeting turned out to be a mere roadshow as he was scheduled to address two more. It is one of the Assembly segments in the district with a sizeable population of Muslim minorities. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal was also supposed to address the gathering at the Panja Centre.   Swift arrangements are on to shift men and material to different destinations across the country. In Krishna district, in addition to the RTC buses, nearly 200 vehicles including big and small cars, cabs, closed-body goods vehicles and‘prachara rathas’are pressed into service. They criss-cross roads to reach their destinations on March 10, but residents of Edurumondi and Edurulanka in Avanigadda Assembly segment will receive the men and material in two boats and a punt, sent along with life jackets as the villages do not have road connectivity, says a transport official, leaving one wondering why such neglect in a State aspiring to grab international attention.

‘Lack of timely loan facility a barrier for MSMEs’|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Lack of timely disbursal of term loans and working capital, delay in payments by customers are the major bottlenecks for the growth of MSMEs, speakers at a seminar organised by the Vikrama Simhapuri University on Sunday said. Mr. Y. Vidhyasagar, MD, Cefel Herbal Private Limited observed that 60% of MSMEs had to shut down within a few years of their establishment and only 15% to 20% of the MSMEs thrived.  “Universities and engineering colleges must include practical issues faced by the MSMEs in the academic curriculum,” A.P.K. Reddy, national president of Federation for Small and Medium Enterprises (FSME) suggested. He promised to impart training upon 100 university students to enable them to take up pilot industrial projects and subsequently to place them in the Sri City and Krishnapatnam Port.

‘Congress leadership entered into deals with KCR’|HYDERABAD|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be addressing a public meeting at Lal Bahadur Stadium in the city at 5.30 p.m. on Monday, his second in Telangana in this election season after the first meeting held at Mahabubnagar on Friday. Top BJP leaders of the State, including party president K. Laxman, Bandaru Dattatreya, and G. Kishan Reddy, would share the dais with him. “Tomorrow’s meeting will once again assert the strength of our party in TS to serve as alternative to TRS. The main fight is between us and TRS with Congress nowhere in the picture. We are sure to do well and increase our vote share,” claimed Mr. Laxman, after visiting the meeting venue to check the preparations being made on Sunday. The BJP leader claimed that the Congress leader “had entered into deals” with the TRS leadership to “protect their business interests” and this was making several long-standing leaders of the party quit and join the BJP. Senior Congress leader P. Sudhakar Reddy and G. Vijayarama Rao, former TRS legislature party leader, would join the party in the presence of Mr. Modi, he said. Mr. Laxman demanded that the proposed third front or Federal Front spell out their Prime Ministerial candidate. Questioning KCR’s take on surgical strikes, former Union Minister Bandaru Dattatreya charged that KCR had never attended a Cabinet meeting and had not replied to a single question in Parliament as Union Minister; so there was no way he could be aware of such actions even if taken by the then Government. The party Telangana unit leadership announced that national president Amit Shah would address public meetings at Karimnagar and Warangal on April 4 while Home Minister Rajnath Singh would participate in a meeting at Peddapalli.

Main parties field only six women for LS polls|HYDERABAD|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|It is elections time and the concern is back. The issue of women’s low political representation surfaces again. The main political parties in Telangana have fielded only five women in the ensuing 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Altogether, out of the 443 candidates finally in the fray, only 21 are women — accounting for not even 5% even though female voters constitute close to 50% of the 2.96 crore electorate in the State. Of the six women fielded by the main political parties — Congress, BJP and the Telangana Rashtra Samithi — four candidates have political lineage. The ruling TRS fielded two women — Kalvakuntla Kavitha, sitting MP and daughter of Chief Minister K.Chandrasekhar Rao, for Nizamabad Lok Sabha seat and Maloth Kavitha, daughter of MLA Redya Nayak, from Mahbubabad Lok Sabha constituency. The BJP too fielded two women candidates — D.K.Aruna, three time Congress MLA and former minister who hails from a politically influential family in Mahbubnagar district. Her father, brother, husband and brother-in-law had served as MLAs. The other candidate is Bangaru Shruthi, daughter of late BJP president Bangaru Laxman from Nagarkurnool (SC) Constituency.  Independents The lone woman candidate fielded by the grand old Congress party is former MP Renuka Choudhary, from Khammam Parliamentary constituency. Wife of an industrialist, Renuka Choudhary was a greenhorn when she entered politics and got elected as Telugu Desam corporator and soon chosen by late N.T.Rama Rao in recognition of her calibre as Rajya Sabha candidate. CPI (M), though a national party fielded candidates in only two Lok Sabha constituencies and one of them is a woman Mallu Laxmi contesting from Nalgonda seat. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections too, the number of women nominees fielded by main political parties was dismal. While Congress and BJP did not field any woman candidates, TRS fielded only one — Kalvakuntha Kavitha from Nizamabad. Overall 12 women candidates filed nominations, including four Independents, two each from AAP and Pyramid Party of India, BSP-I among others. This time 21 women candidates, including six from the main political parties and eight Independents, are in the fray. Nizamabad MP Kalwakuntla Kavitha admitted though the youngest State of Telangana emerged as a model State for its innovative policies, Odisha and West Bengal stole a march over others in giving significant allocation of tickets to women.  Other states Four time Odisha Chief Minister became the first Chief Minister to reserve 33% of Lok Sabha seats for women candidates from the Biju Janata Dal for the ensuing parliamentary election. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee of Trinamool Congress too announced 41% of seats to women in the State. In the recently held Assembly elections, TRS fielded just four women for 119 seats in Telangana Assembly, amounting to just 3%, and three of them won. Congress fielded 11 women candidates and three of them won. There are only six women legislators in the Telangana Assembly after 2018 Assembly elections, a drop from nine women legislators in the first Assembly of the new Telangana State.
Won’t tolerate attempts to deceive A.P., says Naidu|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu on Sunday said that he had no objection to YSRCP president Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy toeing the line of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but warned that he would not tolerate any attempt by Mr. Reddy to deceive the people of Andhra Pradesh. The CM, who participated in a roadshow at Payakaraopeta in the district on Sunday, was visibly buoyed by the huge turnout at the roadshow. Referring to the statements of Mr. Reddy that Mr. Modi was responsible for the setting up of Kia Motors in Anantapur, Mr. Naidu said that the YSRCP chief was trying to appease Mr. Modi in a bid to wriggle out of the CBI cases pending against him. Massive beach road Taking credit for the tremendous growth of the IT sector in Hyderabad, Mr. Naidu said that he had a vision in mind for the development of Visakhapatnam, Kakinada, Rajahmundry, and Eluru on similar lines. A four-lane beach road could be developed from Itchapuram in Srikakulam district to Tada in Nellore district, he said. “Once the road is developed, the world will come to us. Investments will pour in and employment can be generated,” he said, speaking on his vision to develop the State. Referring to the YSRCP chief’s appeal to voters to give him a chance, Mr. Naidu asked the crowd, “Can we place our future at his feet? Shall we vote for him to save him from going to jail?” Slew of schemes He said that Rs. 5 lakh would be given under NTR Vaidya Seva for availing of medical treatment. He agreed to the demand for sanctioning of a degree college at Nakkapalli and a junior college at S. Rayavaram and provision of jobs to fishermen, who were displaced by the Naval Alternate Operating Base (NAOB) at Rambilli. He said that Rs. 9,300 crore arrears pending from 43 lakh housing beneficiaries would be waived after the TDP comes to power again. He recalled that when Mr. Reddy had said setting up Kapu Corporation was not possible, he not only established it but also gave funds for it. He said that Mr. Modi could not threaten the States with IT or ED raids. Mr. Naidu alleged that Mr. Modi was creating obstacles in the development of AP by not releasing the promised funds. The CM said that Mr. Modi had deceived AP by failing to implement the assurances given in the AP Reorganisation Act. He elaborated on the various welfare schemes like provision of bicycles to girl students, loan waiver, NTR housing and provision of Rs. 9,000 crore to DWCRA units.

‘TRS leaders not letting Cong campaign’|WARANGAL URBAN DT.|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|TRS leaders were putting pressure on officials to deny permission to the Congress for their campaign vehicles and public meetings in the district, alleged party candidate Dommati Sambaiah, MLA Gandra Venkataramana Reddy and a few others on Sunday. The Congress candidate had applied for vehicle permissions on March 26 and till date, they were not cleared by the election officials. Similarly, police were being instructed by the TRS leaders not to give permission to Congress public meetings. “After having mobilised many people at Thorrur, police denied us permission. We had to send them away without holding a meeting,” Mr. Reddy said. The ruling party leaders were behaving in an unbecoming manner, which no other party leaders ever did in the past. It was not proper to pressurise officials to act in a biased manner favouring only the ruling party, they alleged. “Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao should feel ashamed for denying permission to Opposition leaders to hold campaign meetings before the Lok Sabha elections. Congress never resorted to such cheap tricks. Mr. KCR does not even allow the media to raise questions or reveal the real situation. He considers himself more than Napolean and Hitler and people know what happened to them,” Mr. Venkataramana Reddy said. The Congress leaders also said that the TRS had no moral right to seek votes from people of Warangal as they did not deliver a single promise.

TS tops in e-learning training of field staff|HYDERABAD|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|For the second successive year, Telangana has been ranked first in e-learning training programme of Department of Personal and Training (DoPT) of the Government India.

Senior Congress leader not to campaign in Nizamabad|NIZAMABAD|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Congress received yet another jolt in the district with the announcement of former minister and party in-charge for Parliamentary elections P. Sudarshan Reddy stepping down from the post. He sent a letter to that extent to the AICC president Rahul Gandhi on Saturday morning. The last ditch efforts made by party candidate and former MP Madhu Goud Yashki to convince Mr. Reddy did not yield positive result. Talking toThe HinduMr. Sudarshan Reddy said that he was reluctant to take part in the party campaign on behalf of the nominee when a slew of farmers filed nominations in protest against the failures of governments in ensuring remunerative price to turmeric and red jowar and other crops. “Farmers are in dire straits and their demand is genuine and their agony can be understood. They filed nominations collecting money from farming community. Hence, I cannot participate in campaign against them in the areas where they belong to. However, I will continue in Congress and canvas in Bodhan, my native Assembly constituency,” he explained. Meanwhile, it is said that Sudarshan Reddy is not happy with the party leadership in the State as it endorsed Madhu Yashki candidature when he proposed the names of Raheem Shaifi and one NRI Tirupathi Reddy.

Former MLC Arkala Narsa Reddy who joined the Congress along with A. Revanth Reddy from TDP quit the party a few days ago. This is a dent to the party and close on the heels of his decision Mr. Sudarshan Reddy, who is only the major source of energy for the party in the district after a major exodus to TRS gave a shock.

‘Dropped candidates’ shed buckets of tears|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Elections bring with them a variety of emotional scenes in public domain originating from leaders who are either adversely or favourably affected. Take for instance, the scenes in the background of dropping of TRS MPs Sitaram Naik and Ponguleti Srinivas Reddy. Mr. Naik broke down at a public meet while his family turned equally emotional when a team of TRS leaders went to their house in Warangal. Meanwhile, on his first visit to Khammam after he was denied party ticket, Khammam MP Srinivas Reddy was flanked by his supporters who wept bitterly. Mr. Reddy himself became emotional and tried to console them. On the other hand, another aspirant for ticket G.Vivekanand vent his spleen on TRS president K. Chandrasekhar Rao for not selecting him from Peddapalli. The selection of candidates was not without scenes showing some of them being upbeat. Ms. Renuka Chowdary who had earlier driven a tractor in an election rally, sat in the driver’s seat in an autorickshaw in Khammam.  TRS leaders are resorting to traditional methods of beating the heat during the election campaign in Adilabad. Since the district generally records a high temperature in summers, which makes electioneering all the more an uphill task and risk lives, the TRS leaders in campaign mode are distributing onions to the cadre. They insist that onions would act as a good therapy against sunstroke. The party workers were also supplied butter milk.   With the campaign for the forthcoming elections peaking, the authorities are focussed on tracking the activities of parties and their contestants through social media. Faced with restrictions on the election expenditure, candidates, these days, are relying more on the social media for campaigning as it is found to be effective medium for reaching out large number of people in their respective constituencies. Given the potential this mode of campaign has in influencing the electors, the election authority has kept a watch on the proceedings in social media deploying experts at State and district levels. “Monitoring the social media continues to be a difficult task. But the word that we are monitoring the content will act as deterrent,” a senior election official said.   Those who have been following political developments in Telangana in the context of defections to the ruling TRS from other parties, mainly Congress, one common dialogue heard from them is that they are doing so only for the sake of development of their constituencies. On the other hand, TRS president and Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has repeatedly made it clear that the government has not discriminated against constituencies represented by other parties in the matter of development as he believes the development of entire Telangana is his objective. Those who have been switching their loyalties to the ruling party have also been talking about “getting attracted by the development and welfare initiatives of KCR. However, the irony is that a few ‘defectors’ have even moved courts and tribunals against the initiatives in the past. (N. RAHUL, M. RAJEEV & B. CHANDRASHEKHAR)

Backing women who dream big|Hyderabad|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|An international start-up corridor, specifically designed for women, was inaugurated in the city on Sunday. Located in the financial district of Gachibowli, its launch saw around 180 women entrepreneurs from 24 countries taking part in the event. The biggest delegation was led by Ahlam Yousif Janahi, the president of Bahrain Business Women’s Society. “The International Women Start-up Corridor (IWSC) is expected to help aspiring women entrepreneurs to systematically reach a platform to transfer knowledge on various aspects,” said Asif Iqbal, the President of Indian Economic Trade Organisation (IETO), who was present at the inauguration. The start-up corridor would work in collaboration with Bahrain, a partner country, and the Bahrain Business Women’s Society. “With 45 high net worth investors and businesses, the IWSC will be a focal point of exchange,” said Dr. Iqbal, adding that the stable government in Telangana was the main driving factor for these international investors to think of investing here. “With the government’s progressive approach towards new businesses, Hyderabad is the most appropriate city to have the corridor for women start-ups” said Dr. Iqbal. “My goal is to build bilateral relations between the women in India and those in Arab,” said Vijaya Saraswati, director of IWSC Hyderabad centre. Discussing challenges Some of the countries whose women would be a part of the IWSC are Japan, Indonesia, Morocco, Bahrain, Oman, Sri Lanka, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Bangladesh, Nepal, Djibouti and Russia.

Water woes: villagers to boycott elections|KAMAREDDY|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Enraged at the continued negligence of successive governments to their demand of supplying safe drinking water residents of Tadihipparga in Madnur mandal, on Maharastra border, passed a unanimous resolution to boycott elections unless their problem is resolved within a week. The resolution passed in a meeting presided by sarpanch Prakash Pochiram Gaikwad and laterdandora(tom tom) was conducted in the village inhabited by over 1,800 people. They handed over the memorandum to an official at mandal office. P. P. Gaikwad, who retired as deputy executive engineer in Maharashtra, was elected unanimously as sarpanch. The sarpanch appealed to elected representatives to sanction Rs. 25 lakh to solve the chronic problem, but to no avail. “Our Sarpanch met the Member of Parliament and local MLA thrice on the issue,” his close associate Balu Shinde said. “There are some 100 wells fitted with pumpsets but the water is not drinkable, it has high salt and fluoride content. The residents are forced to fetch water on bicycles, two wheelers, bullock carts and tractors from a borewell in Sonala village, two kilometers from Tadihipparga. Earlier, they used to bring water from small pits on the Lendi stream bed. But, now the stream has gone bone dry,” he added. “We don’t want to vote for any political party unless and until the chronic water problem in our village is completely solved. We have been facing this for the last four decades. Elected representatives come and go via our village but they never bothered to mitigate our problem,” laments Tulasi Bai Dandewad.

Bhondsi attack victims say neighbours keeping distance|GURUGRAM|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|“Can you see thetiranga(tricolour) fluttering on top of that three-storey house? That’s their house,” said a motorcyclist, pointing towards a building painted in gold, with glass facade. The house stands out amidst the single-storey structures of Bhoop Singh Nagar in the Bhondsi area off Gurgaon— the home of the Muslim family attacked by a group of men on Holi. “We put up the Indian flag when we build this house around two years ago. It has been there since then. We are proud Indians,” asserts Mohammad Sajid, lying on a bed with his right hand in a cast and injuries on his left leg and back. To his right sits Mohammad Abid, 23, leaning against the wall near the window. His left leg is in a cast and he wears a cervical collar after the brutal assault earlier this month. Mr. Sajid, 44, recalls that he and his elder brother Mohammad Jamshed, 57, had come to Gurugram from Baghpat in Uttar Pradesh in search of livelihood around 15 years ago. While he set up a workshop to repair cooking gas stoves in Ghasola village, Mr. Jamshed started a furniture shop in neighbouring Badshahpur. Soon their three other brothers also migrated to Gurugram. “We never faced discrimination because of our religion. It happened to us for the first time,” says Mr. Jamshed of the Holi attack. However, he refuses to speculate on whether the brutal attack on his family, which has left six of them severely injured, had anything to do with the growing atmosphere of religious intolerance in the country. “We are businessmen. We know little about politics. We cannot say why it happened. But it all started after the two men on a motorcycle hurled religious slurs at us without a reason and told us to go to Pakistan. We were playing cricket away from the main road. It was all unprovoked,” claims Mohmmad Dilshad, the complainant in the case. His left arm was also fractured in the attack. But more than the attack, it is the registration of FIR against the two members of his family that has left them shocked, says Mr. Dilshad. “We were beaten up. We are the victims in the case. But now we are made the accused,” he says. ‘Scared to go to work’ “Though we have met the Commissioner of Police and he has assured security and justice, we are sceptical after the registration of the case against us,” says Mr. Jamshed, adding that they are too scared to venture out and return to work. “Our shops are closed since the attack took place. Despite round-the-clock police presence, we have seen people loitering around suspiciously adding to our fear,” he says. The shards of the broken glass scattered at the entrance, and inside, the house bear testimony to the savage attack. “We had come over to our uncle Sajid’s house since the shop was closed on Holi. We all were inside with the entrance open when the assailants barged in, the house armed with sticks and iron rods. A few of them remained outside and hurled stones and bricks on the glass façade,” Mr. Dilshad says. Shocked by the sudden attack, family members, including women and children, ran frantically seeking shelter. Some of them locked themselves on the terrace on the first floor and rest on the second floor. Dilshad, who was on the first floor terrace, recalled how the assailants first tried to break open the iron door, but they could not. “They then pulled out the window grill to barge inside,” he says. One of the boys ran outside amid the commotion and rushed to the neighbours seeking help, but none dared to intervene. Mr. Jamshed says that though it has been more than ten days after the attack, the neighbours have not inquired about their well-being. Though the attack took place in broad daylight around 5 p.m. and the assailants were at the spot for more than an hour, none of the neighbours, watching from the roof-tops of their houses, came to their rescue. “They fear that it could happen to them as well,” says Mr. Jamshed. No Muslim family has come forward to help either. Though the family has, for the time, shelved plans to shift following assurances from the police, Mr. Sajid is not sure of the future.  We are businessmen. We know little about politics. We cannot say why it [assault] happened... It was all unprovoked Mohmmad Dilshad complainant in the case

TS-RERA enhances penalty to Rs. 3 lakh|HYDERABAD|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Telangana State Real Estate Regulatory Authority (TS-RERA) has once again decided to give one more opportunity to the real estate project developers for registering their respective ventures by charging an enhanced Rs. 3 lakh as penalty, if done by April 30. This process of registering of projects has been kept open for which permission was taken between January 1, 2017, and August 31, 2018, from competent authorities — municipal or urban development authorities — across the State, informed TS-RERA chairman Rajeshwar Tiwari in an official release here. It is mandatory on the part of the promoter to make application for registration of ongoing projects within a period of three months from the date of commencement of Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016. And, as per the Telangana state Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Rules, 2017, projects approved on or after January 1, 2017, are to be registered with TS-RERA. From August 31 last year, TS-RERA has been issuing timelines for registration of projects online with the first deadline being November 30, 2018. Ever since, it has been extending the deadlines and also increasing penal amounts.

Seven-year-old hit by truck while playing cricket, dies|NEW DELHI|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|A seven-year-old boy, who was trying to catch a ball during a cricket match that was being played close to a busy road near Ramlila Ground in central Delhi on Saturday evening, died after being hit by a tempo, the police said on Sunday. The police said that they have arrested the tempo driver. ‘Was chasing ball’ The incident took place around 4.15 p.m. when the boy, identified as Mohammad Talig, who lived in Khwaja Meer Dard Colony with his family, was playing cricket with his friends near Shakur Ki Dandi, they said. Eyewitnesses told the police that the boy, while chasing the ball, had come on the main road in front of Zakir Hussain College where he was hit by the speeding tempo.  ‘Thrown 10 feet away’ “Locals said that the impact of the collision was such that the boy was thrown at least ten feet away. He sustained severe injuries in the neck and head,” said a police officer.  The tempo driver, identified as Omprakash Yadav (30), took the child to Lok Nayak Hospital with the help of passers-by where the doctors pronounced the child dead, the police added. The police said that the locals called them up and handed over the driver to them. An FIR was registered based on the statement of one Parvez, who hails from Amroha in Uttar Pradesh and lives in the same neighbourhood as Talig. Parvez claimed to have witnessed the accident. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central) M.S. Randhava said, based on the statement, they have registered a case under charges of rash driving and causing death due to negligence against the driver. Examining CCTV footage “We will find out if the driver was under the influence of alcohol when the incident took place. We are also examining CCTV camera footage of the area to establish the sequence of events,” he also said. The police further said that Talig is survived by his mother and two brothers, adding that his father had left the house around five years ago.

Kant Enclave houses to be pulled down today|FARIDABAD|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Thirteen houses at Kant Enclave, a 400-acre township housing bungalows of retired Army officers, former bureaucrats and senior advocates, are scheduled to be demolished on April 1. The demolition is being carried out in adherence to the Supreme Court order in September last year. A senior Department of Town and Country Planning Official toldThe Hinduthat the houses scheduled to be demolished were vacated in adherence to March 31 deadline of the Supreme Court and the demolition would be carried out on Monday morning. Undertaking given “There are a total of 42 structures built on 44 plots in the township. Of these 24 people had given undertaking in the Supreme Court to vacate their premises by July 31. Later, seven more gave the similar undertaking. The remaining 13 houses will now be demolished. We hope to complete the demolition in a single day,” said the official. The top court had on September 11, 2018, ordered demolition of houses built illegally in Kant Enclave, which lies in the protected forests of the Aravalis, noting that ecological damage done by developers of the colony to the ancient hills was irreversible. The court had earlier fixed December 31, 2018 deadline for the demolition, but later extended it till March 31 this year for the residents to vacate their premises. Bulldozers arrive The sources at the Kant Enclave said that two bulldozers had arrived at the township on Sunday evening and four more were on the way. The demolition will be carried out by a joint team of Department of Town and Country Planning, Municipal Corporation of Faridabad and Sub-Divisional Magistrate (Badkhal) under the supervision of the Deputy Commissioner. Deputy Commissioner Atul Kumar had on March 29 called the meeting of the affected residents at his office and told them to vacate their premises in adherence to the court order. Vishisht Seva Medal awardee Brigadier (retd.) M.B. Anand, who has been spearheading the legal battle in the matter, said that it would probably be the first instance in the country when the houses in an authorised colony would be demolished.

‘Upset with makers of series on Nirbhaya case’|New Delhi|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|While Netflix seriesDelhi Crimehas got rave reviews for its sensitive portrayal of the Nirbhaya gangrape case, Inspector Anil Sharma is upset with the makers and is planning to take the legal route against them for the depiction of a character based on him. Mr. Sharma was the SHO of the Vasant Vihar police station where the case was registered in 2012 which had led to an outrage across the nation. The police officer said he regularly met the victim when she was admitted in a hospital in the national capital and spent time with her. He said he had not missed a single hearing in the case and is still in touch with the victim’s family. Director apologised Mr. Sharma, who hasn’t watched the series yet, claimed its director Richie Mehta has apologised to him, but he felt that the character’s portrayal has hurt him. Mr. Mehta had earlier said the show dramatises the incident and includes back stories of the police personnel, the condition of the force, their power struggle with the bureaucracy and managing the scoop-hungry media. The series depicts the Vasant Vihar SHO’s character as an officer who is not trusted by his seniors and tries to shirk work, even when the team is racing against time to nab the culprits. Later in the series, the character, christened Vinod, becomes more responsible and even makes a suggestion to the Deputy Commissioner of Police to go in for orthodontics technique, which was used for the first time in any case and helped nail the accused. The technique matched the bite marks on the victim’s body with the teeth marks of the accused using dental casts. The police officer said he is planning to initiate legal proceedings against the makers of the series. Mr. Sharma, currently posted as the SHO of the Lodhi Colony police station, said that he had faced three inquiry commissions in the case and none of them found any laxity on the part of the police station. “They, in fact, praised us. Even the courts praised the police’s efforts. The series has maligned my reputation and I am considering whether I can go to court against them,” he said. Mr. Sharma said he is upset and even though the director, Richie Mehta, has apologised to him, he is not pacified.  The series has maligned my reputation and I am considering whether I can go to court against them  Anil Sharma Inspector

‘ Abortion a right few women are aware of’|NEW DELHI|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Only one in 10 abortions in Delhi are reported, say gynaecologists, with the official figures on termination of pregnancies hovering between 49,000 and 56,000 in last six year (2013 to December 2018), as disclosed by the Delhi Health Department in an RTI reply. “This doesn’t even come close to the actual figures that are rarely disclosed and kept extremely confidential,” said gynaecologist Dr. Puneet Bedi. While the official figures itself, according to doctors, are just an indication of the trend in the sector, what is more worrying is the fact that only 42 maternal deaths related to abortions have been reported and recorded between 2013 and 2018, all of them in government hospitals expect two. The missing data “There is no data available from private hospitals about maternal deaths related to abortions except two in 2016-17. The data clearly hides more than it reveals,” said RTI activist Rajhans Bansal who sought the figures on abortions and related maternal deaths. “Abortion in India is legalised and governed under the ambit of Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, wherein a woman can opt to medically terminate her pregnancy with the approval of one or two registered medical practitioners up to 20 weeks of gestation,” said Dr. Rita Bakshi, gynaecologist-obstetrician and chairperson, International Fertility Centre. She said it is unfortunate that till date a large majority of women, even in urban India, are unaware of their rights regarding abortion and continue to resort to unsafe and medically non-substantiated methods of abortions which at times prove fatal. “As a matter of fact, unsafe abortions currently account for one of the leading causes of maternal mortality in our country,” said the doctor.  Induced abortions Dr. Archana Dhawan Bajaj, gynaecologist and IVF expert, Nurture IVF Centre, said an induced abortion is always a planned action which mostly takes place in a situation when the continuation of pregnancy carries risk to the life of the expecting woman or it can bring upon serious threat to her physical or mental health. Also in cases where the child is upon a substantial risk of being born seriously handicapped with physical or mental abnormalities, induced abortion is an option. “Often unexpected pregnancy due to failure of contraceptives also leads to induced abortion,” she added. “Earlier a significant number of abortions were carried out based on the gender of the baby [female foeticide], but in recent years people are opting for induced abortions mostly due to health concerns. The most common age group to go for abortions is also changing gradually from teenage girls to women in their late 30s and 40s.”  Miscarriage risk Women over the age of 35 are at high risk of suffering miscarriages. According to doctors, miscarriage in early pregnancy (less than eight weeks) is most commonly because of genetic abnormalities in the embryo, hormonal imbalance or some other medical problems with the mother. Miscarriage in later pregnancy is because of uterine abnormalities and autoimmune diseases in the mother. Dr. Sonia Naik, head of unit, obstetrics and gynaecology, Max Super Speciality Hospital, said: “Abortions are commonly seen in pregnant women who are 35 years and above because of increased genetic abnormalities in the embryo.” She added that termination of pregnancy related to female unborn child happens in the early second trimester. “These are women who come asking for termination of pregnancy or take pills sold over the counter [easily available in our country] for abortion,” she added. In metro cities like Delhi, women of reproductive age may seek abortions due to various reasons such as failure of contraceptives leading to unplanned pregnancies, medical complications that are likely to cause harm to the mother and the unborn baby, and being worried about various socio-financial implications (many couples do not wish to have a second child or feel that having a baby may interfere with their professional careers). For unmarried girls or married women below 21 years of age, abortions are sometimes seen as a way out to shove off age-inappropriate, untimely responsibilities. Dr. Rita Bakshi said that even though gender detection of feotus is illegal in India, sex-selective abortions continue to be a persistent problem, especially in rural towns and suburbs. “However, it is important to mention that only less than one-tenth of the total abortions happening in India are estimated to be sex-selective, while a vast majority of abortions take place during the first trimester [when it is practically impossible to determine the gender of the baby]. Female foeticide is a major social issue and a sensitive topic which needs to be seen and handled from a wider lens instead of only blaming abortions for it, which usually contribute to a very minor proportion of this large social problem,” said Dr. Bakshi.   Abortion in India is legalised and governed under the ambit of Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, wherein a woman can opt to medically terminate her pregnancy with the approval of one or two registered medical practitioners up to 20 weeks of gestation Dr. Rita Bakshi Gynaecologist-obstetrician, and chairperson of International Fertility Centre  There is no data available from private hospitals about maternal deaths related to abortions except two in 2016-17.

Dadri lynching accused seen at BJP rally|Noida|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The accused in the Dadri lynching case were seen sitting in the front row of a BJP rally addressed by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in Bishahra village of Dadri on Sunday. Mr. Adityanath was campaigning for Union Minister and BJP candidate Mahesh Sharma who is contesting from Gautam Buddh Nagar in Uttar Pradesh. On September 28, 2015, 50-year-old Mohammad Akhlaq was lynched in Bishahra village near Dadri for allegedly eating beef during Eid and storing it for later consumption. ‘Falsely implicated’ Vishal Singh, one of the prime accused in the case, who was seen sitting in the front row with other accused in the case, said they had been falsely implicated in the case. He also said “nothing will happen now,” since they are out on bail, he smiled. In the chargesheet filed by the police, Vishal Singh was accused of making an announcement from a local temple that Akhlaq had consumed beef and was storing it in his house. All 17 accused in the case are out on bail. Addressing a rally at a ground in Bishahra village, Mr. Adityanath said everyone now knew what happened in Bishahra. “How shamelessly the Samajwadi government suppressed the emotions of the villagers. I can proudly say that after the BJP formed the government in UP, we immediately ordered shutdown of all unauthorised slaughterhouses in the State.” He said Bishahra actually never happened. “People in western Uttar Pradesh are living a peaceful life under the BJP rule because impossible is now possible because of [Narendra] Modi,” he said. Promises more jobs Mr. Adityanath appealed to Bishahra people to vote for Mr. Sharma because being a Union Minister of State for Tourism and Culture, he had developed temples all over the country and helped to establish Hindu culture. “After the Jewar airport gets operational, western Uttar Pradesh will get one lakh jobs,” he said. “After 2007 Samjhauta Express blast, the Congress had come up with a term ‘Hindu Terrorism’. I want to ask from where has this word come from and how can you defame the Hindu community that is well-known for brotherhood, peace. Now it is upon you [voters] to choose the Congress that support terrorism or Narendra Modi, who is wiping terrorism from India,” said Mr Adityanath. First visit by a CM He said the Congress ruled the country for the maximum years post-Independence. The Samajwadi and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) ruled Uttar Pradesh several times but they focused on ‘development’ of their family members. But after Narendra Modi took over on May 26, 2014, as PM, the “political dynamics changed for ever”. Bishahra is a Rajput-dominated village with around 3,000 votes. It was first time when any Chief Minister visited the village after lynching incident.  How shamelessly the Samajwadi government suppressed the emotions of the villagers. I can proudly say that after the BJP formed the government in Uttar Pradesh, we immediately ordered shutdown of all unauthorised slaughterhouses in the State Yogi Adityanath Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister

Cong trying to weaken Oppn parties fighting BJP, says AAP|NEW DELHI|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Aam Aadmi Party on Sunday alleged that the Congress was trying to weaken the Opposition parties that were coming together to fight the threat to the nation posed by the “dictatorial regime of Prime Minister Narendra Modi”. “In Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and several other States, where the Opposition is strong, the Congress is fielding candidates to divide votes,” alleged Delhi AAP convener Gopal Rai. Contradictory actions He added that in Delhi and Haryana, the Congress had taken three months to decide on an alliance but was yet to take a call. Mr. Rai said that the actions of the Congress party were contradictory to its publicly stated strategy that it was fighting to get rid of the BJP government. Mr. Rai said that by announcing that Congress president Rahul Gandhi was going to contest from the Wayanad parliamentary constituency in Kerala, where the Left Front is strong and the BJP has no presence, the Congress was giving mixed signals. “Instead of concentrating on States where there is a direct BJP-Congress fight, the Congress is attacking regions which have presence of strong anti-BJP forces. Even in Delhi, the Congress has been in a state of confusion since the last three months and is unable to decide whether it wants to defeat BJP or not,” Mr. Rai said. He added that anti-BJP parties were unable to understand what the Congress wanted to achieve by trying to divide the Opposition votes. ‘Needs to come clean’ “The Congress needs to come clean whether it is under some pressure of the Central government to split anti-BJP votes and if it was serious about removing a dictatorial regime,” Mr. Rai said. He added that AAP and the Congress may have many differences in Delhi, but the matter at hand was a national issue where anti-BJP parties were working to ensure that Mr. Modi did not come back to power.  Instead of concentrating on States where there is a direct BJP-Congress fight, the Congress is attacking regions which have presence of strong anti-BJP forces  Gopal Rai Delhi AAP convener

Ponguleti Sudhakar Reddy quits Congress to join BJP|Hyderabad|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|A day after completing his six-year term as the member of the Telangana Legislative Council, Congress leader Ponguleti Sudhakar Reddy resigned from the party and decided to join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Mr. Reddy sent his resignation to AICC president Rahul Gandhi and later met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi expressing his desire to join the party. Mr. Reddy had a long stint with the Congress and worked as the president of the National Students Union of India (NSUI) and Andhra Pradesh Youth Congress for a long time. He was rewarded for his service with national level posts like AICC secretary and later nominated as the Member of Legislative Council in Telangana. In the recent Assembly elections he was keen on contesting but could not be nominated due to some seats going to the Grand Alliance in his native Khammam disrtict. He was also an aspirant for the Khammam Lok Sabha seat but the party decided to field former Union minister Renuka Chowdary. Mr. Reddy is likely to join the BJP at the public meeting to be addressed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Hyderabad on Monday.  Move faulted TPCC treasurer Gudur Narayan Reddy strongly condemned Mr. Sudhakhar Reddy’s criticism on the Congress party and its leadership in his resignation letter released to the media. “Sudhakar Reddy was given several opportunities by the Congress party although he never won an election in his lifetime. He had served as an MLC till March 29. However, just two days after the expiry of his term, he resigned from the party while levelling baseless allegations against the leadership. This shows his opportunistic approach and greed for power,” he said. Mr. Reddy said he is apparently trying to please Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao by criticising the Congress party during the peak of election campaign. He said that the exit of some selfish and opportunist leaders would not harm the Congress party.

Restructuring landfills: Bhalswa follows Okhla|NEW DELHI|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Having brought down the height of the Okhla landfill from 50 metres to about 38 metres and having stabilised the structure through a year-long ‘remediation’ process that started in March 2018, a similar project is now being undertaken at the Bhalswa landfill by the North Delhi Municipal Corporation. The collapse of a portion of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation’s Ghazipur landfill in September 2017, which led to the death of two people, had shifted the focus on managing landfills to ensure safety. While the South Delhi Municipal Corporation, which runs the Okhla landfill, received external proposals to deal with the landfill, the work was finally undertaken through departmental means, especially given that it was a lot cheaper, said executive engineer for the project Taufell Ahmed. He has now been roped into working on the Bhalswa landfill, along with Civil Engineering Professor at IIT Delhi, Manoj Datta, who is overseeing both projects. The drill In the first stage, the garbage undergoes re-profiling. “The process involves excavation, cutting, channelising, aeration, spreading, levelling/dressing, compaction and sorting of fluffy material such as plastic or clothes,” an SDMC project report on the Okhla landfill reads. This involves the use of earth moving machines which tear the garbage down and turn it over multiple times. This allows the garbage, which is stuck in packed anaerobic conditions, to be aired out thus speeding up the decomposition proces. The garbage is also spread over vacant land near the site to help the decomposition. This is in turn pressed together, or compacted depending on the structural requirement. The dry bulk density of the compacted waste is 1.5 metric tonne per cubic metre, the report states. Finally, the garbage once in place, is topped with a layer of silt or some form of construction and demolition waste. The stabilisation work itself begins with construction of 15-16 (average) metre-widekachharoad, including a three-metre openkachhadrain at the bottom of the landfill, according to the report. The road helps in movement of the machines involved and for airing out the garbage and the drains help divert rainwater. This is done to reduce the amount of leachate generated which is the sludge that forms when water passes through garbage and dissolves soluble. The first slope is 10-metres high and spread over a 27-metre long incline, in the ratio of 2.5:1, determined by the engineers to ensure stability. At the top of this slope, a six-metre widekachhaberm or a flat levelling is constructed along with anotherkachhadrain. Similarly, three slopes of dumped material, of the same size have been constructed from top to bottom. And to trap rainwater,kachhadrains have been constructed at the bottom of each slope. The final structure resembles a hill, with convex or roundish slopes so as to increase surface run off during rains, along with flat relief at two intervals wherekachhadrains collect the water. Research report Tests of the stabilised dump, carried out by Shri Ram Institute of Industrial research revealed that after stabilisation, the garbage consists of 93.72% of sand, earth, soil, bricks, concrete etc, 1.97% organic matter, 3.77% plastic and 0.54 glass and metals, the report states. The test also noted that the process reduced the height of the Okhla landfill by 30%. The report further reads, following a site visit by a Supreme Court appointed committee in December last year, environmentalist Almitra H Patel, who is part of the committee, suggested that grass be planted where work of slope stabilisation has been completed so as to hold the earth and eliminate chances of slippage. Ms. Patel also suggested that as and when additional land is made available to the SDMC, the “biomining” of the entire dump be carried out, according to the report. A total of 5,700 square metres is to be planted with grass. While this step was expected to be completed by the end of March, the engineer in-charge Mr. Ahmed, said that the work is likely to be completed by June. In its attempt to manage the landfill, other processes such as trapping of leachate that leaks from garbage and treating it and installation of pipes to extract trapped methane are also involved. However, so far, Mr. Ahmed said that very low methane content is found in the garbage. The undertaking at Bhalswa, spread over 52 acres with a height of 62 metres, will be the first step on the same line. Meanwhile, the North Corporation has also invited a tender for scientific capping of the landfill. However, commissioner Varsha Joshi has said that it will take place only after all possible volume reduction and biodegradation happens.

NGT directs UP pollution board to look into ‘pollution’ by paper mill|NEW DELHI|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Following a plea seeking action against alleged pollution caused by a paper mill in Uttar Pradesh’s Shahjahanpur, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the State pollution control board to carry out an inspection. Directing the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board to furnish an action taken report on the same, a Bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel noted that the UPPCB was unable to carry out inspections earlier owing to the ongoing Kumbh festival. “Report [dated January 25] has been received. Consent to operate under relevant rules expired on December 21, 2018, but the unit was lying closed on account of directions during Kumbh festival. After re-opening, further inspection will be carried out,” the Bench noted. The Bench further added, “The report does not show whether valid permission for extraction of groundwater has been taken by the unit. The UPPCB may now carry out such inspection and verify whether there is any bypass for discharge of effluents in any waterbody.” The directions came while the NGT was hearing a plea that sought “remedial action” against alleged pollution caused by K.R. Paper Mills in Shahjahanpur.

‘Cong. didn’t follow selection process’|Mumbai|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The State Congress has not followed the due procedure to select candidates for the Lok Sabha polls, a senior party leader has said. As per the procedure, aspirants apply to the State party unit and the shortlisted names are forwarded to the central leadership after the candidates are interviewed, he said. “But, this process was not followed in the selection of candidates this time,” the leader said on condition of anonymity. He said that around 40% of the candidates given tickets this time are those who switched over to the Congress from other parties in the last one year. Suresh Dhanorkar, who is the Congress candidate from Chandrapur, was a Shiv Sena MLA till recently, while Nana Patole, who has been fielded from Nagpur, joined the party last year. Similarly, Subhash Zambad, the candidate from Aurangabad, was earlier with the NCP, while Kishore Gajbhiye, the nominee from Ramtek, switched over from the BSP, he said. A team of Congress observers led by party general secretary (organisation) K.C. Venugopal met Maharashtra Congress leaders on Saturday, as the State unit is plagued by discontent and defections. While Abdul Sattar has raised a banner of revolt in Aurangabad, senior Congress leader A.R. Antulay’s son Naveed joined the Shiv Sena a few days ago. Senior leader Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil’s son Sujay Vikhe-Patil joined the BJP earlier this month, he said. The leader also said that if Praveen Gaikwad, who joined the Congress on Saturday, is fielded from Pune, then Brahmins, Dalits and OBC voters may shift from the party.

J&J told to pay damages, but hip implant victims sceptical|Mumbai|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Central Drug Standards Control Organisation (CDSCO) has ordered pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson (J&J) to pay Rs. 74.5 lakh as compensation to a Mumbai-based woman who was fitted with a faulty hip implant. Patients who have been at the forefront of the fight against the company over the faulty implants, however, are apprehensive if it will ever pay the damages. The CDSCO has given 30 days’ time to Johnson & Johnson to pay the amount and submit the patient’s acknowledgement to them by the first week of April. “It has to be seen if J&J would abide by the Central Expert Committee (that decided the compensation amount) order and pay the Mumbai-based patient,” said Bengaluru-based Rajagopal Viswanathan, who was fitted with J&J’s faulty implant in both hips in 2007. He underwent a revision surgery in his left hip in 2008. In December 2018, J&J filed a petition in Delhi High Court challenging the CDSCO’s measures for compensation. The High Court did not interfere in the matter as the Supreme Court was already looking into a public interest litigation on the faulty implants. “The company went to the Supreme Court to seek a clarification. On March 29, the apex court has allowed the High Court to decide on the petition,” Mr. Viswanathan said. He said that many patients have contested the formula on which the compensation is based. The metal-on-metal Articular Surface Replacement (ASR) hip implant manufactured by J&J’s subsidiary DePuy Orthopaedics was recalled worldwide in 2010 following reports that it was leaching metal and causing severe pain, fluid accumulation, and metal poisoning. In India, nearly 4,700 surgeries were carried out using the faulty hip joint. Malini Aisola of the All India Drug Action Network (AIDAN) said J&J has paid out huge amounts to compensate victims abroad. “But in India, the company is putting all its energies into escaping the liability and denying the compensation,” said Ms. Aisola, who thinks the Indian patients are the worst affected because they came to know about the fault in the implants very late. “Thousands of patients have not yet been identified. It is a greater injustice that Indian patients will suffer by being denied the compensation,” she said. Mumbai-based patient Vijay Vojhala, who was implanted with the faulty artificial hip in 2008 and had to undergo a revision surgery thereafter, said the government should take action against the company. “Patients like me have suffered for more than a decade. What about the culpability of the company that continues to conceal facts? Thousands of patients are still missing from the database. The company initially did its best to restrict compensation to a tiny fraction of patients and now is trying to nullify the entire process,” said Mr. Vojhala, who feels that if J&J intended to pay the compensation, it would have done it by now.

Aaditya to tour State to interact with the youth|Mumbai|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Yuva Sena leader Aaditya Thackeray on Sunday announced the schedule for his initiative ‘Aaditya Samvad’, a platform to reach out to the youth ahead of the Lok Sabha elections. He will hold interactive sessions in Nashik, Aurangabad, Kolhapur, Maval and Mumbai. The Sena leader had held a session in Thane in March called ‘Yuva to Yuva’, where he interacted with people and took questions on various issues. After the event, he decided to hold similar sessions across the State. “We realised Aadityajihas a connect with the young and old alike. Senior citizens like him because he is Balasaheb [Thackeray]’s grandson, while youngsters like him as they feel he is one of them, someone who speaks their language, understands their life, their issues. We want them to talk to him directly,” Rahul Kanal, a Yuva Sena functionary, said. The Sena is banking on the fact that there is no youth leader in Maharashtra, and wants to tap into the large vote bank. Mr. Thackeray will be hold a session in Aurangabad on April 2, in Nashik on April 7, in Kolhapur on April 13, in Mumbai on April 21 and in Maval on April 24.

Goel attacks Kejriwal govt for ignoring drug addiction issue|New Delhi|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Leader of Opposition Vijay Goel of the BJP lashed out at the Arvind Kejriwal government for not paying attention to the issue of drug addiction in Delhi during its tenure, at ‘padyatra against drugs’ on Sunday. He said it would be a major issue during the upcoming polls as well as next Assembly elections. Mr. Goel was speaking at the Jawahar camp JJ colony in Kirti Nagar where he took out a rally with party workers and residents of the area. In a statement, he condemned intoxication in all forms and expressed concerns over increasing consumption of drugs in the Capital, for which he held the Delhi government responsible. He said that Mr. Kejriwal was worried about the critical situation of drug abuse in Punjab, but had remained silent on the growing influence of drugs in the city in the last four years. Drug addicts in slums Claiming that between 50-60% of youth in Delhi’s slums are drug addicts, Mr. Goel said it was an administrative failure on the part of the Delhi government that addictive drugs were readily available in schools, colleges, and JJ bastis. He also said that the de-addiction programmes that the Kejriwal government runs have failed to find a solution to this problem.

Man gets 3 years’ rigorous imprisonment for molesting woman|Thane|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|   A Thane court has awarded three years’ rigorous imprisonment to Prakash Andhere, 47, for molesting a Dalit woman.

Two owners of blaze-hit Bangladesh tower arrested|Dhaka|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Police in Bangladesh said on Sunday that they had arrested the owners of an office tower in Dhaka that caught fire earlier this week, killing 26 people and renewing the country’s debate over lax safety standards. The latest deadly blaze to hit Bangladesh’s congested capital tore through the 22-storey FR Tower on Thursday, leaving some of the hundreds trapped inside screaming for help as horrified onlookers massed outside. Police said they had detained two men, S.M.H.I. Faruque and Tasvir Ul Islam — who is district leader of the Opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) — in the capital, after filing charges against them for criminal negligence.  Police said they were also looking for the owner of the construction firm which built the tower in the 1990s.

Mahajan calls on Uddhav over Aaditya’s ‘missing photo’ row|Mumbai|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|A day after the Shiv Sena’s youth wing went up in arms against Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Poonam Mahajan, Ms. Mahajan met Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday to resolve the issue. Yuva Sena members had declared on Saturday that they would not campaign for Ms. Mahajan as she had not included a picture of their leader Aaditya Thackeray on her political banner. The Sena chief went to Gandhinagar on Saturday to support BJP President Amit Shah, who filed his Lok Sabha nomination papers from the constituency. The pictures of the two of them, and other senior NDA leaders hugging each other raised eyebrows as the alliance partners had been bickering until a few months ago. Saturday’s visit sent a message to party workers that the animosity was over. But there was a hiccup in Mumbai over the weekend, after a banner on the stage where Ms. Mahajan addressed a joint office bearers’ meeting featured the pictures of senior BJP and Sena leaders, but not Mr. Aaditya. Yuva Sena claimed the same had happened on some pamphlets too. “We brought it to the notice of the authorities concerned, but got no response. Both parties have agreed upon a protocol where the picture of senior-most leaders will be displayed on all election material. From Shiv Sena, the protocol is to use pictures of Balasaheb, Uddhavjiand Aadityaji. They should follow the protocol and not take us for granted,” a Yuva Sena functionary said. “We will not campaign for [Ms. Mahajan] until she addresses the issue with the party high command and we get clear instructions,” Sena corporator Amey Ghole said. However, Ms. Mahajan changed the posters to include Mr. Aaditya soon after. On Sunday, she tweeted that she had gone to Mr. Thackeray’s residence Matoshree to seek his blessings ahead of the elections. “The affection between both families is assuring,” she tweeted. Ms. Mahajan did not respond to calls. “The matter has been resolved. We will now campaign for her as per protocol,” Yuva Sena functionary Rahul Kanal said.

Embrace the Essentialist outlook|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|In addition to your usual college course load, you join the debate, drama and quizzing societies. As you are an active member in each one, your days are packed. Though you are already stretching yourself thin, you decide to do a part-time internship at a local startup, after college hours, three days a week. As you hadn’t expected to get the internship when you applied, you now feel compelled to take up the offer. But, as you are loath to forsake any activity, you find yourself on a very tight rope. And, sure enough, you begin to slip up. First, you are late in submitting your record work. Then, unlike your usual stellar accomplishments, your marks on tests are below average. To add to your woes, the head of the quizzing society pulls you up for missing two meetings in a row. When you take part in a debate, your performance is lacklustre. Just when the work at the startup gets interesting, you contract a nasty flu. Being forced to rest in bed gives you a much-needed respite to assess your situation objectively. Prioritise You have taken up an insurmountable load that it is simply not possible to do justice to your commitments. Business consultant and author, Greg McKeown, advocates the less is better principle, and urges you to become what he calls an ‘Essentialist’. He says that if want to succeed, you have to “give yourself permission to stop trying to do it all” so that you “can you make your highest contribution towards the things that really matter.” In other words, you need to evaluate how you are investing your time and energy, and prioritise things that are most significant. By opting to do what is essential and weeding out the rest, you can make a more meaningful contribution. In order to embrace an Essentialist outlook, let go of the notion that can do it all if you simply work harder. If you keep pushing yourself by taking on more, soon enough you will reach breaking point. Besides your work getting slipshod, you will also compromise your health. Instead of aiming to do more, pick and choose what you take on. Given that there is limited time, make judicious choices on how you want to spend your day. To make the most prudent selection, first, be open to all available possibilities. But before committing to an activity or duty, ask yourself if these tasks inspire you. Do they tap your talents or fulfil a need within you? Don’t feel guilty when you eliminate extraneous activities. McKeown exhorts us to switch from the “undisciplined pursuit of more to the disciplined pursuit of less.” Ironically, success can compel you to assume more responsibilities as you feel confident of handling more tasks. But as you assume more duties without necessarily assessing your impact, your efforts may get diluted and you may grow increasingly distracted. McKeown refers to this as the “paradox of success.” So, even when the going is good, be discerning of the choices you make. And, this involves learning to say ‘No’, firmly but politely, to activities or commitments that detract from your most salient goals. Eminent management guru, Peter Drucker, once said in an interview, “People are effective because they say ‘no,’ because they say, ‘this isn’t for me.’” Take stock of your progress and periodically review your objectives, which may change in subtle or profound ways. Being in touch with yourself will help distinguish essential from superfluous goals.

Trekkers take books to tribal students|Pune|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Students of nearly 200 primary schools in the far-flung tribal areas of Sahyadri hill ranges in Maharashtra are getting into the habit of reading books, thanks to an initiative by a group of trekkers from Pune. The Marathidesha Foundation, through its movement ‘Shivsahyadri Granthdindi’, is setting up libraries with books on history, environment, animals, forts and stories of well-known scientists, authors, sportsmen and freedom fighters in these schools. Damodar Magdum, a member of the foundation, said that during their treks and fort conservation-related activities, they realised that the schools in the Sahyadri ranges were facing a resource crunch. “We thus planned to donate books that can be used for extracurricular reading,” he said. Several trekkers and fort lovers are now coming forward and contributing to the cause, he said. “As of now, we have set up over 200 libraries,” Mr. Magdum claimed, adding that they aim to take this to 2,000. The group makes sure that students read books in their spare time. “We ask schools to designate one day as ‘reading day’ and also ask students to write to us about the book they read,” he said. Savlaram Pote, a teacher at a primary school near Shivneri fort, said they received over 150 Marathi books from the foundation and students were enjoying reading them in their recess or other free time. “The students are reading books, explaining what they understood from it and also writing letters to the foundation members,” he said.

Candidates’ image may play a big role in high-profile Nagpur|Nagpur|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari, during his campaign, tells voters that he never lets social or political equations come in the way of Nagpur’s development and stresses against voting based on caste, religion, or community. Apart from being idealistic, the speech exposes reasons to worry for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Nagpur and the changed social equations. In 2014, amid the Modi wave and call for change, Nagpur — the headquarters of the BJP’s parent organisation, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) — voted out Congress’s Vilas Muttemwar after 20 years by a margin of around 2.85 lakh votes. Mr. Gadkari won the election with a promise to bring development and employment to the city. His clean slate won him votes even in Muslim and Dalit pockets. Not only was the Congress candidate old, and ran a lacklustre campaign, but also the infighting within the party made him a sitting duck. This time, the Congress has picked former BJP MP of Bhandara-Gondiya, Nana Patole, who resigned from his post in 2017. Mr. Patole portrays himself as an individual, who even took on Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the sake of his ideals and his past shows he could be the giant-killer in the Lok Sabha elections. Kunbi candidate Mr. Patole belongs to the Kunbi community, the largest in terms of numbers in the constituency. Kunbi, Halba, Dalit and Muslims form the majority of voters in the constituency. A Kunbi mega conference was held in Nagpur two months ago in a bid to unite all castes and sub-castes within Kunbis. “The Congress for the first time in two decades has fielded a Kunbi candidate. Mr. Patole’s clean image, aggression is being appreciated, and Kunbis are voluntarily holding rallies for him,” Kamlesh Wankhede, senior journalist with Marathi newspaperLokmat, said. ST status to Halbas Halbas are angry with the BJP for not fulfilling the promise of extending Scheduled Tribe status to the community. Halbas and Kunbis were with the BJP in the 2014 general polls. Around 32 Dalit organisations recently held a closed-door meet and decided to vote for the Congress to defeat the BJP. “Muslims too will vote one way to the Congress,” Mr. Wankhede said. The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) has given ticket to Mohammad Jamal, restricting its chances to cut in to Dalit vote bank. For the BJP, despite changing social equations, Mr. Gadkari’s image remains the biggest asset. The party while campaigning on the development plank, is organising small, close-door community meetings. With six MLAs in the city and all owing allegiance to Mr. Gadkari, the party is fielding State ministers and leaders from neighbouring constituencies to ensure victory at any cost. Concern for BJP Issue of unemployment and discontent within traders remain the major reason to worry for the BJP. As per Mr. Gadkari’s claim, he initiated works worth Rs. 70,000 crore in Nagpur city alone, but the number of youths given jobs stand at 25,000 when the promise was of 50,000. According to political observer Jaideep Hardikar, the anti-BJP forces are silently working on ground. “One can witness that forces which are ideologically against the BJP are helping the Congress this time. Communities, traders too are silently working. There is no Congress leader to lead but these forces are doing their work,” he said.

Murky swamp|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The drama of government-formation and Cabinet shuffle amid shifts in political allegiance in Goa serves as a reminder of the dark shadows of manoeuvre and intrigue that lurk within Indian democracy. Goa politics has for long been an arena of overnight desertion and defection. But the death of Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar earlier last month, and the midnight swearing-in of Pramod Sawant, came against the backdrop of the ruling BJP’s aggressively expansionary phase. In this post-2014 phase, the BJP has been unabashed about targeting its allies, as its partner in Goa, the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party, found out last week. Two of the MGP’s three MLAs in the Assembly joined the BJP. One of them, Manohar Ajgaonkar, was appointed Deputy Chief Minister hours later, replacing Sudin Dhavalikar, the third MGP lawmaker. The breakaway faction constituted a two-thirds majority in the MGP legislature party, which just might safeguard the manoeuvre from the anti-defection provisions of the law. The split of the MGP and the merger of the splinter group with the BJP were all carried out in the dead of night, with Speaker Michael Lobo working his office through odd hours as if it were a national emergency. In the 2017 Assembly election, the Congress had emerged as the single largest party with 17 seats in the 40-member House, and the BJP had 13 seats. Through a series of manipulative acts that raised questions of political propriety, the BJP managed to form the government. To lead the rickety coalition with the MGP and the Goa Forward Party, the BJP brought Parrikar to the State. His death triggered the current round of jostling for power. The BJP sought to lure MLAs from supporting parties to reduce their collective bargaining power even as the new government was being formed. The MGP was trying to pre-empt the BJP bid by suspending one lawmaker to foreclose the option of a split in the legislature party, when the BJP struck first. The episode has underscored Goa’s disrepute as a theatre of absurdities of Indian democracy. There is speculation that the BJP is now targeting MLAs of the GFP and even the Congress. The BJP and the Congress have 14 MLAs each. The GFP lawmakers boycotted the swearing-in of Mr. Ajgaonkar, who has hopped from the Congress to the BJP to the MGP and back to the BJP. Some BJP leaders have rightly warned that such machinations will undermine the party’s credibility. GFP leader Vijai Sardesai has sought clarity from the Chief Minister on his political plans. It is clear that the current government or any other combination will not inspire trust and confidence in the people. If Goa is not to witness a sequence of party-hopping in search of ministerial berths and loaves of office, a fresh election might be the only answer.

Suspended constable dies in custody|GUWAHATI|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|A Manipur Police constable, suspended in connection with the escape of an extremist leader, has allegedly died in custody during questioning. Constable S.M. Manjur Ahmed was one of 10 police and medical personnel suspended after Thokchom Nando Singh of the outlawed Kangleipak Communist Party escaped while undergoing treatment at the Jawaharlal Nehru Institute of Medical Sciences in Imphal on March 25. Singh was arrested more than a decade ago for the kidnapping and murder of Lungnila Elizabeth, the eight-year-old daughter of former Minister Francis Ngajokpa in November 2003. “The constable was found dead in custody,” a police officer said, adding that they were trying to ascertain the reason for his death.

Knowledge Quiz|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Q1BBC had a current affairs programme called “Panorama” since 1953, that is still going strong with a prime-time slot. In 1957, their programme consisted of a Swiss family harvesting a popular food item from their family tree. After the programme aired, the BBC received several calls asking for advice on growing their own tree to produce ______. The BBC told them to ‘place a sprig of ______ in tomato sauce and hope for the best.’ At the time, this dish was uncommon in the U.K., and was considered an exotic luxury. So, Britons were unaware of how it was made and from whence it came. This was BBC’s first ever April Fool’s joke, that was made 66 years ago today. What was this exotic food item that Britons thought they could grow? Q2The segment ‘Flight of the _______’ was featured in the opera “The Tale of Tsar Saltan”, written by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. Its composition is intended to evoke the seemingly chaotic and changing flying pattern of a _______. Despite the segment not being an area of focus in the opera, it gained fame because of its usage in pop culture. What is the segment named, given that it closes out an act where a character is turned into an insect, so he can fly away? Q3This university is an international and research-intensive institution located near Rajgir in India. It was set up to emulate the earlier version of the institution, widely considered the greatest of all ancient monasteries, and as the world’s first residential institution that stood for over 800 years. The initial version was likely ransacked and destroyed by the Mamluk dynasty. What is its name, that’s attributed to the abundance of lotus stalks in the area, and would come to mean ‘giver of lotus stalks?’ Q4This genetic hybrid of a female horse (mare) and a male donkey offers the best of both animals. It is less obstinate and more intelligent than a donkey, while it is more patient, hardy, and long-lived than horses. Often referred to as a beast of burden, this animal is mostly used for carrying loads. It was notably used in the Anglo-Afghan wars to carry ammo. Which ‘fantastic beast’ is this? Q5It was invented accidentally by Joseph Priestley in 1767, when he discovered a method to infuse water with carbon dioxide. It is known as sparkling water or carbonated water in many regions. However, in America and non-Commonwealth regions, a different term is used. It comes from the fact that a German town, renowned for its mineral springs holds a genericised trademark for this naturally carbonated water. What is it called? Q6This word comes from Etienne de _______, a French finance minister, who in 1759, was forced to impose severe economic restrictions, and cost-cutting measures upon the French people. Therefore, the word initially meant ‘to do or make something very cheaply.’ Before the advent of photography, this method was the cheapest way of recording a person’s image. It was usually done on a white background, and the person’s likeness would be portrayed by opaque, dark, black ink. (pictured) What is this method/word called?

Six die as vehicle falls into gorge|Jammu|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Six persons, including four members of a family, were killed and a woman critically injured on Sunday when a vehicle plunged into a deep gorge in Jammu and Kashmir’s Rajouri district, police said. The accident occurred at Ujhan-Dhandkote in Darhal area around 12.30 a.m. when the driver of the vehicle, which was on its way to Sabzi village, lost control while negotiating a curve, a police officer said. He said locals launched a rescue operation immediately and were joined by police parties and a team of doctors and paramedics. Four persons were found dead, while three others were rescued in a critical condition, the officer said, adding that two of the injured succumbed later.

Going back to the salt pans of Mumbai|Mumbai|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|It’s 89 years since the famous salt satyagraha led by Mahatma Gandhi, who marched 241 miles to Dandi along with 80 people to break the salt law imposed by the British. In Mumbai, a group of enthusiasts recently relived a part of history by participating in a salt pan walk at Wadala organised by the Asiatic Society of Mumbai. “Mumbai was always known for its salt pans. From Shivaji Maharaj to the British, everyone had interest in this region because of its salt pans,” Vinayak Parab, a member of the Mumbai Research Centre of the Asiatic Society, who led the walk, said. Mr. Parab has been researching salt pans for the past six years. The city’s salt pans are spread from Wadala to Mahul, Kanjurmarg to Vikhroli and Goregaon to Bhayander. On the eastern side, the British had built a narrow-gauge railway between Mahul and Wadala and from Vikhroli towards Thane to collect and transport salt. Remains of these tracks are visible in some places. During Gandhi’s salt satyagraha in 1930, many locations in Mumbai witnessed the civil disobedience movement, but the satyagraha at Wadala salt pan was the most prominent. Thousands of satyagrahis would gather at the Wadala salt pans and often face brutal lathi charge. “Salt has a very rich history. It was the first commodity that was traded. It plays an important role in our body. The words salary and soldier have originated from salt. But today, we never look at salt with such importance,” he said. In ancient Rome, soldiers were given money to buy salt, which was expensive but essential, and sometimes even paid in salt. Salt pans, Mr. Parab said, play a significant role in the ecology of the city and an entire culture has evolved around it. “Salt pans have different species of birds and insects thriving on them. They have an enormous water-holding capacity that helps in flood control. The communities that work on salt pans have their own songs revolving around them,” said Mr. Parab. There is a lack of awareness about salt pans, he said. With the government’s plan to use the salt pans for affordable housing projects, they now face a threat of extinction. “I knew about how important salt pans were but there were so many new aspects that were unknown to me. For example, I had no idea that Shivaji Maharaj had fought a battle with the Portuguese to control the salt pans here,” Omkar Salunkhe, a history teacher from Wilson College, who participated in the walk, said. Dr. Shehernaz Nalwalla, a managing committee member of the Asiatic Society of Mumbai, said that every nugget of information was new to her. “We consume salt every day but we take it for granted. The walk exposed many new dimensions of salt to us,” she
Gallacher wins; Rashid, Chikka 10th|GURUGRAM|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|After collecting a rare quadruple-bogey on the seventh hole in the afternoon, Stephen Gallacher could not have expected to lay his hands on the winner’s trophy of the $1.75 million India Open golf on Sunday. Notwithstanding the 44-year-old Scot’s strong finish — he had three birdies on the last four holes — he also owed much of the top-prize of $291,660 to the quadruple bogey that hit long-time leader Julian Suri on the 14th hole, when leading by three shots at 10-under. As it turned out, Gallacher’s one-under 71 gave him a winning aggregate of nine-under 279 while Suri’s final-round 77 could give him only a share of the fourth spot at 282, worth $80,846! Kawamura runner-up On a day when the DLF Golf and Country Club almost had its revenge on the front-runners, Japan’s Masahiro Kawamura finished runner-up, a stroke ahead of Spain’s Jorge Campillo, who sparkled with a 67. The Indian challenge faded after S. Chikkarangappa’s early double-bogey. Rashid Khan did well to catch up with Chikkarangappa at 284 in the joint 10th spot. The story of the final day was the fortuitous run of Gallacher, joint leader on the opening day. The seasoned campaigner, who won back-to-back Dubai Desert Classic titles in 2014 and was part of the Ryder Cup that year, produced two superb approach shots on the 17th and 18th to stay out of Kawamura’s reach. “When you’re 44 you’re in the sort of twilight, so it’s a big win for me. It was good to finish it out the way I did it, three-under for the last four is a great way to finish,” said the champion. “It was great to have Jack (my son) on the bag and Mother’s Day (back home in Scotland) as well makes it even more special.” Talking about the horrendous quadruple bogey, he said: “I was pretty calm after that hole (the seventh), there’s nothing really much you can do. To see that I was only five back gave me a wee bit of encouragement.” The scores: 279: Stephen Gallacher (Sco) (67, 74, 67, 71); 280: Masahiro Kawamura (Jpn) (69, 70, 68, 73); 281: Jorge Campillo (Esp) (70, 73, 71, 67); 282: Christian Bezuidenhout (RSA) (68, 76, 70, 68), Julian Suri (USA) (67, 67, 71, 77). Indians: 284: Rashid Khan (72, 70, 72, 70), S. Chikkarangappa (74, 70, 66, 74); 288: Shubhankar Sharma (69, 73, 71, 75); 291: Gaganjeet Bhullar (72, 74, 74, 71); 292: S.S.P. Chawrasia (74, 72, 71, 75); 293: Ajeetesh Sandhu (74, 71, 73, 75); 301: Rahil Gangjee (70, 74, 77, 80), Gaurav Pratap Singh (73, 73, 73, 82).


Cong. a true national party: Shatrughan|New Delhi|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Actor-politician Shatrughan Sinha, who has announced that he is quitting the BJP, on Sunday said he decided to go with the Congress as it was a national party in the true sense and family friend Lalu Prasad also advised him to do so. He said leaders such as Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee, Samajwadi Party supremo Akhilesh Yadav and Aam Aadmi Party national convener Arvind Kejriwal, among others, wanted him to join their respective parties, but he had made it clear that whatever be the situation, the constituency he would be contesting in the Lok Sabha poll would be Patna Sahib.

Seeking the next frontier|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Last Wednesday, on March 27, India carried out an anti-satellite (ASAT) test using an interceptor missile (as a kinetic kill vehicle) to neutralise a target satellite (possibly the Microsat-R launched in January this year) in a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) at an altitude of around 300 km. While India is the fourth country (after the U.S., Russia/USSR and China) to acquire this capability, Prime Minister Narendra Modi became the first leader to have announced the successful test in a national address. In contrast, China had quietly carried out its first successful hit-to-kill intercept in January 2007 till international reports about the consequent increase in space debris forced Beijing to acknowledge the test. France and Israel are believed to possess the capability. India’s test has not violated any norm as there is no international treaty prohibiting the testing or the development of ASATs. Keeping watch, keeping pace After the Indian test, a senior U.S. Air Force Space Command official, Lt. Gen. David D. Thompson, appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee (Strategic Forces Subcommittee) and said that based on public information, the U.S. had expected a test, and that a base in Colorado had tracked it. U.S. systems are monitoring between 250-270 objects of space debris that were created following the test. The U.S. will notify satellite operators in case a threat to any is assessed. He added that the debris did not pose a threat to the International Space Station, which orbits at an altitude of around 350 km.  An ASAT capability is normally a part of a Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) programme. While a BMD targets an incoming ballistic missile, an ASAT interceptor targets a hostile satellite. Since a satellite moves in a precise orbit which is tracked, it gives greater time for target acquisition though satellites in higher orbits pose greater challenges for the kill vehicle. Faced with Pakistan’s growing missile capability in the 1990s (Pakistan acquired the M-9 and the M-11 missiles from China and the No-dong from North Korea), India embarked on its BMD programme in 1999. A modified Prithvi was to be developed as the intercept missile. Work on a long-range tracking radar (Swordfish) that could track incoming ballistic missiles to enable target acquisition was also taken up. Testing began nearly 15 years ago followed by the integration of the various systems, including the active RF seekers, fibreoptic gyros and directional warheads. In 2011, an incoming Prithvi missile was destroyed by the interceptor missile over the Bay of Bengal at an altitude of around 16 km. Another half a dozen tests have been carried out since 2011, gradually expanding the parameters of the system to enable taking on targets at higher altitudes. Both the U.S. and USSR began to develop ASAT systems as a part and parcel of their anti-ballistic missile programmes. During the 1980s, both countries concluded their kinetic kill interceptor testing. Instead, they began to focus on co-orbital anti-satellite systems and directed energy (laser) systems which could neutralise a satellite without fragmenting it and generating space debris. With developments in offensive cyber capabilities, a promising new area is to disrupt communication links between the satellite and ground control by damaging the transponders or the power source. After the 2007 test, China too has carried out subsequent ASAT development along these lines. A crowded space Since the Sputnik was launched in 1957, more than 8,000 satellites/manmade orbiting objects have been launched, of which about 5,000 remain in orbit; more than half are non-functional. Currently, more than 50 countries own/operate the nearly 2,000 functional satellites in orbit. The U.S. accounts for more than 800 of these, followed by China (approximately 280), Russia (approximately 150). India has an estimated 50 satellites. Of these 2,000 satellites, over 300 are dedicated military satellites. Once again, the U.S. has the biggest share here, with nearly 140, followed by Russia with nearly 90 and China with nearly 40. India has two dedicated satellites, one each for the Indian Navy and the Indian Air Force. Indian defence forces also use the civilian government owned satellites extensively for communications, remote sensing, and location accuracy and meteorology. Growing amounts of space debris pose a real risk to satellites and spacecraft, as the Oscar-winning filmGravitydemonstrated. There are over 20,000 objects of debris which are the size of golf balls while those of smaller size run into hundreds of thousands, totalling nearly 6,000 tonnes. The U.S. Department of Defense routinely tracks approximately 23,000 man-made objects achieving orbit to ensure safety of its space-based assets. One of the reasons that the international community protested strongly about the 2007 Chinese test was that it added nearly 3,000 pieces of debris as the test was done at a higher altitude (800 km), from where it would take decades to dissipate. The debris created by the Indian test, which was undertaken at a low altitude, is expected to dissipate much faster. Patchy international control The salience of space in defence is evident from the fact that all three countries — the U.S., Russia and China — have set up ‘Space Commands’. This has given rise to demands to prevent the militarisation of space so that it is preserved “as the common heritage of mankind”. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty followed by the 1979 Moon Treaty laid the foundations of the legal regime for space beginning with the rule of law, refraining from appropriating territory, non-placement of any weapons of mass destruction in space, and prohibition of military activities on the moon and other celestial bodies. However, these treaties were negotiated when the technology was still in a nascent stage. Satellite registration was introduced in the 1970s though compliance has been patchy. The U.S. has been adamantly opposed to negotiating any legally binding instrument to prevent ‘militarisation of space’, questioning the very meaning of the term, given that space as a medium is increasingly used for military applications. In 2008, Russia and China had proposed a draft to kick off negotiations on the Treaty on the Prevention of the Placement of Weapons in Outer Space and of the Threat or Use of Force Against Outer Space Objects. It was rejected by the West, and not merely because it is such a mouthful of a title. The European Union, mindful of U.S. allergy to any negotiations on this issue, began to develop an international code of conduct based on transparency and confidence-building measures. The UN General Assembly has called for a declaration of political commitment by all countries that they shall not be the first to place weapons in space. This initiative too has floundered as norm building cannot take place in a political vacuum. At present, the U.S. is the dominant presence in space, which reflects its technological lead as well its dependence on space-based assets. It therefore perceives any negotiations as a constraint on its technological lead. While countries have developed and tested ASATs, they are not known to have stockpiled ASAT weapons. Effective use of an ASAT also requires space situational awareness capability, which works best if it is a cooperative effort. India’s successful ASAT test is therefore a technology marker. Further development of interceptor technology and long-range tracking radars is necessary for a robust BMD and the Defence Research and Development Organisation also needs to move on to newer technologies to enhance its ASAT capability in the coming years.

Spider research yet to pick up pace in India, say experts|Mumbai|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The recent discovery of a new species of jumping spiders in Aarey Colony has had arachnologists — specialists in spiders and related animals — and wildlife experts call for a greater focus on studying spiders in India. While the last major research was conducted between the 1990s and 2000s by Dr. Manju Siliwal, a senior arachnologist who specialises in mygalomorphs, experts believe a lot of diversities of spiders are yet to be discovered in the country. In a study published on Saturday by Russian peer-reviewed journalArthropoda Selecta, a team-led by arachnologists Rajesh Sanap, Dr. John Caleb and biologist Anuradha Joglekar announced that they had discovered a new species of jumping spiders in the city’s Aarey Milk Colony. Named after additional principal chief conservator of forest, Sunil Limaye, Jerzego sunillimaye was found for the first time in 2016. In the research that spanned over the next three years, researchers were able to understand the natural history of this species and explore interesting aspects that were not documented before. “We were able to explore different habitats such as grasslands, rocky and forested patches to find out the habitat these tiny spiders preferred. Several males and females of various life stages were observed throughout the years, specifically in the monsoon, when the females were observed guarding their egg sacs, while males were seen wandering under the rocks,” Mr. Sanap said. While other species of jumping spiders such as the Langelurillus Onyx, Langelurillus Lacteus — both described in 2017 — and Piranthus decorus — recorded for the first time in 122 years in the area — have inhabited the Aarey Colony, more studies pertaining to their complete biology, habits and interactions with other species are yet to be carried out. While there are 4,800 species of spiders in the world, India alone accounts for 1,800 spider species. While the research in other parts of the world such as Thailand, Germany, Canada and the United States has been steady, experts said it is yet to pick up pace in India. “Spiders are important creatures as they are pest-controllers. They are like the tigers of the microhabitat world. Pulling them out could cause ecological imbalance,” Mr. Sanap said. According to Dr. John Caleb, a Chennai-based arachnologist, who has been researching spiders for the last 10 years, species of spiders other than wolf, crab, orb-weaver and ground spiders have not received enough attention in India. “Fewer number of arachnologists in India is also a problem. While the research on spiders was catalysed by Dr. B.K. Tikader, considered the father of Indian arachnology, it has subsided over the years,” Dr. Caleb said. Dr. Manju Siliwal, he said, started working on the ancient group of spiders called the mygalomorphs, and published an updated checklist of Indian spiders in 2005. “Currently, there are not many researchers taking interest in spiders. This is primarily because of lesser encouragement to pursue spiders and study their nitty-gritty,” he said. ‘Taxonomic study tough’ Dhruv Prajati, another arachnologist from Ahmedabad, said understanding the taxonomy — the morphological features — is tough in India. “Without taxonomic studies, one cannot arrive at a proper conclusion till experts are consulted. Besides that, a lot of specimens collected in India are deposited in museums abroad. While describing new species, we have to draw comparisons with what has already been described, by seeing type specimens, which is hard. Most characters used in the 19th century have been revised and updated over the years and without specimens, identification of species being observed becomes difficult. Efforts to improve and enrich the collection of specimens of spiders in India has just begun,” Dr. Caleb said. Considered dangerous Mr. Sanap added the data sharing and awareness about spiders in the country was minimal. “People consider crawling beings as dangerous and some have phobias too. There are also certain baseless myths attached to spiders. One needs to understand that while studying any arthropod, animal or other being, one needs to respect their space,” he said.

Stars set to land in Berhampur|BERHAMPUR|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Berhampur parliamentary constituency in Odisha that is going to the polls on April 11 is set to witness campaigning by political heavyweights of different parties over the next few days.

From fruits to utensils, 198 symbols for Independents|Mumbai|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Independent candidates contesting the Lok Sabha polls in Maharashtra will have 198 symbols to choose from, up from 87 in the 2014 general elections. These symbols, comprising items of daily use, are distributed to Lok Sabha and Assembly candidates as per the Election Symbols (Reservation and Distribution) Order 1968 in a prescribed format, an official release said. Symbols of national and State-level political parties are reserved. As per the release, the 198 symbols include various fruits, vegetables, kitchen articles and utensils, electronic items like computer, laptop and pen drive, farm implements, sand timer, gramophone, typewriter, toothpaste and toothbrush, footwear, socks, helmets etc. Agriculture-related symbols on the list include sugarcane farmer, coconut garden, diesel pump, a farmer driving a tractor, tiller, wells and so on. Vehicles like the rickshaw, truck, helicopter and ship are also part of the list of symbols available for Independent candidates and so are items like bat, ball, football and chess board. Musical instruments like the harmonium, sitar, and violin round off the list.

The dark side of grand narratives|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|“The impossible is now possible” is Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s slogan for the 2019 elections. His supporters believe his vision and leadership have resulted in a new resolve for the country. They believe we now have a ‘New India’. Two incidents last week provided glimpses of this resolve — the testing of an anti-satellite (ASAT) missile on March 27 and the detention by the police of development economist Jean Dreze in Jharkhand the next day. If the first was yet another tentative claim of India’s superpower status, the second was instructive of the indisputable intolerance of the state. Mr. Dreze is a voice of India’s weakest, and the police stopped him from campaigning on the right to food in a place where three out of 100 children die before their first birthday. Since September 2017, activists have catalogued 18 deaths linked to the collapse of social security schemes in the BJP-ruled State. The missile test and the arrest are linked; in the drumbeats of hyper-nationalism, the whimpers of the weak are a dissonant note. Timid or not? One school of strategists has always lamented that India is a ‘soft state’ reluctant to use power to achieve its goals. Hindutva strategists have linked this alleged softness of the Indian state to the ‘timidity’ of Hindus, as well as ‘appeasement’ of Muslims and Christians by the Congress. Over the last five years under Mr. Modi, India has ostensibly shed its timidity. Union Minister Arun Jaitley said after India’s airstrikes in Pakistan: “I remember when the U.S. Navy SEAL had taken Osama bin Laden from Abbottabad... Today it is possible [for India also to conduct such operations].” In a recent speech, Mr. Modi said about terrorists, “We will enter their homes and eliminate them.” In his first campaign speech, on March 28, Mr. Modi said “terrorists and their supporters across the border” wanted him to lose. BJP president Amit Shah said on the same day: “Only two countries in the world avenged their soldiers’ deaths earlier: the U.S. and Israel. Now, India is the third.” India, which is synonymous with Mr. Modi in the narrative, is decisive, capable and willing not merely to achieve its domestic goals, but also to coerce other countries to fall in line. Hindutva’s geographical core is in north, central and western India, and its social core consists of upper caste Hindus and the emergent middle class. Hindutva tried to reach out to the periphery by entering into alliances under Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who became its first Prime Minister. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) during the Vajpayee years roped in ethnic parties in the south and lower caste parties in the north by suspending its three most controversial objectives: abrogation of Article 370 that grants special status to Jammu and Kashmir, the uniform civil code, and construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya at the spot where a Hindutva mob demolished the Babri Masjid in 1992. With its support in the core consolidated and expanding, Hindutva 2.0 under Mr. Modi went for the jugular in the periphery. This approach has been demonstrated the starkest in Jammu and Kashmir. In 2014, as Prime Minister, Mr. Modi campaigned relentlessly against the two regional parties in the State, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the National Conference. After the elections, the BJP and the PDP formed a coalition government, but far from brightening the prospects of a political solution in the State, it has been downhill since then. The Modi government reversed all the gains made in the State towards normalcy. The BJP-PDP partnership did not temper the hyper-nationalism of the former as many hoped; it delegitimised the PDP before its supporters, weakening New Delhi’s link with the Valley further. The BJP is part of the government in seven of the eight north-eastern States now, by forming social coalitions of its own, such as in Tripura, or by forming alliances with regional parties, such as in Manipur. The BJP is soft-pedalling its cow protection agenda in the Northeast, but its goal of full cultural integration of the region with the mainland, or with the Hindi-Hindu nationalism of the Sangh Parivar, is never hidden. Trimming society Hindutva has a grand vision for India, and even the entire world, if one were to go by Mr. Modi’s speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2018. Mr. Modi’s pursuit of that grand narrative of ‘India as a leading power’ is happening even as the perils of several grand strategies that came before are playing out. The U.S. and Israel, the models that Hindutva proponents want to emulate, continue to pay a heavy price. The U.S.’s project to remake the rest of the world as its clones has come a cropper, but not before huge costs were paid in terms of lives and resources. Beijing is pursuing its own grand vision of reshaping the world. For all such pursuits of grand ambitions, which appeal to the core of any society, aggregation and diversion of national resources from the weakest in the periphery are essential. Trying to trim any society to fit into a straitjacket, unidimensional notion of greatness generates agony and hardship as it requires massive use of force. Authoritarian societies achieve it easier, as in China. When a democracy does this, it drifts away from its ethos and turns authoritarian, as has happened in the U.S. and Israel. “How can we talk about being free in this country when we have to leave each day in fear of gun violence in schools... and even from law enforcement?” African-American Senator Cory Booker, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, said on the same day that India declared parity with the U.S. in anti-satellite warfare. He will surely be accused of talking the language of America’s enemies by the hyper-nationalists in the country. Subordination of particular aspirations, and even human rights, to a nationalist grand narrative was not impossible before Mr. Modi. Testing ASAT was also not impossible. The Indian state is not designed to be, and has not behaved, soft by any standards, as Gyan Prakash depicts in his recent book,Emergency Chronicles: Indira Gandhi and Democracy’s Turning Point. India’s dealings with insurgencies of various kinds have been brutal, and the elimination of Sikh separatism during Congress rule is a case in point. At the same time, the Congress system had a mechanism to deal with the aspirations of the social and geographical peripheries of the nation. There were restraints to global adventurism and peace was sought with insurgents, sometimes successfully. In Hindutva 2.0’s grand vision, the periphery is only a theatre to demonstrate strength before the core. The weakest amongst us will pay for this — as slain soldiers, petty criminals shot dead by the police, starvation victims and hapless undertrials. Their voices will be muffled. The search for greatness could numb our soul. varghese.g@thehindu.co.in

Options aplenty|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|I am a class XII humanities student, who is in the process of writing my board exams in English, Hindi, political science, geography, history, and physical education. I don’t know what I want to do after class XII, as I do not know my field of interest. I am a good listener, I can give good advice, and love reading. Other than that, I don’t know what I want to do. Please guide me about the different fields which are unique. - Divya Shrivastava Dear Divya, I hope you have completed your board exams and finally have some time to breathe and keenly think about your field of interests. Since you are a good listener and can give sound advice and love to read, do you want to consider psychology or law? Both are pretty unique and have brilliant scope. English literature is also a good option. What do you really enjoy? Would you want to teach? Do you see yourself being a therapist, or someone in the advertising world, an event manager? Or do you want to specialise in mass communication, work with a leading business house, or be a journalist? Please meet an equipped career counsellor to help you narrow your search with your interest and skill sets. I am 21 years old and have completed my B.E. in EEE. I got a job through college placements, but wasn’t interested in the software job. My passion was always helping people, so I opted for teaching. During B.E, I took tuitions for school students. Presently, I am working as a math faculty in a private institution, but I want to do something to improve people’s life and for my country. I am the only earning member in my middle-class family. How can I improve my career? - Subha Sri Dear Subha Sri, What else in addition to teaching would you like to do, in order to make a difference? Please shortlist specific areas of interest and skill sets that you would you want to develop (whilst working). Many reputed universities offer online courses, specialised programmes through distant education in social work, public health and administration, counselling psychology and master’s in many disciplines like math, for example. Alternatively, there are also organisations (like Teach For India) that are supportive of young adults and that you can join part-time till you find your calling. You could also join the Indian Army, Navy, or Air Force with your B.E credits, as a direct entry. Think of where you see yourself in the next few years and what makes you wake up effortlessly to be charged and ready for a bright new day; you will find your answer. I am currently pursuing my third year in B.A.(Hons.) English, from Delhi University. I am least interested in pursuing M.A. in literature and am considering an MBA in international business or HR. Is there any scope for me? I have studied science in higher secondary. What should I do? - Tina Shah Dear Tina, MBA in international business is a great choice as you can pursue a career as an international trade specialist, an economist, or specialise in marketing and sales or business development or supply chain, become a risk management director, or even run your own business, eventually. An MBA in human resource management, on the other hand, can equip you with the knowledge and skills that you need to deal with high stress situations and develop talent within an organisation. HR is, by far, the most important department of any organisation. Everything from hiring to firing, and in between, is taken care of by HR. HRM extends great potential for employee and company schemes, recruiting, increasing employee benefits, reworking effective policies, appraisals, designing and engaging in training and development, enhancing job stability and improving overall job satisfaction of the office employees. I am 15 years old and am currently studying in class X. I am passionate about astrophysics, and want to pursue a career in the same. Could you tell me about colleges offering courses in astrophysics (for example, B.Sc Astrophysics), in India, and what are the exams through which I must attempt, in order to get admission to such colleges? - Arjun Sijai Dear Arjun, I am assuming that you are passionate about physics, space, and understanding the physical world. First, you have to complete your 10+2 exam in the science stream, and do exceptionally well in math and physics. After 10+2, you will need to take mandatory entrance exams to make it to the college of your choice. You could do a B.Sc or BS-MS in physics and then complete your Ph.D. in astrophysics from IISc, IISERs, which are good institutes for a degree in physics, and of course, the IITs (engineering physics is a course offered by only a few IITs). You could also do B.E in EEE, ETC, or a course in engineering physics across the IITs, BITS Pilani, IISER Mohali, IIST, or other prominent institutes. All these institutions will give you a good headstart. The rest depends on your discipline and consistency. Disclaimer: This column is not a substitute for long-term therapy.

A systematic way of maximising returns on investment|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|What is a SIP? A Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) is a way to invest in mutual funds wherein a fixed sum of money is put into a mutual fund scheme at a specified date every month. It is considered to be investor-friendly and an efficient manner of investing in the capital markets as one can start investing with small monthly contributions instead of first building a huge investment corpus. It is a hassle-free manner of investment as well since one can issue standing instructions to the bank for a specified amount to be transferred to the fund house/distributor every month at a pre-determined date. How can one start a SIP? There are two ways of starting an SIP. One can use the direct way of investing though the fund house or go through a distributor. For direct plans, an investor can go to the website of the fund house for the scheme in which the SIP has to be started. All the fund houses have a link on their portals for investors who want to start an SIP. Typically, only the Permanent Account Number (PAN) and/or Aadhaar is needed to open an account. Thereafter, one can select the scheme, SIP amount, starting date and duration of SIP. If one opts for a distributor, then the same process can be done online on the distributor’s portal. Is it better to start direct SIPs or go through a distributor? The returns for those investing directly will always be marginally better than for those investing through distributors as direct plan investors do not need to pay distributor commission. And since SIPs are typically long-term investments, the difference in the total corpus, at times, could be substantial. However, going through a distributor has its advantages as well as one can get access to investment advice, help in fund selection and a consolidated view of the holdings through an app. On the other hand, if an investor wants to start 4-5 SIPs with different fund houses, then a direct approach would mean going to each of the fund house websites and opening a folio and keying in the details to start the SIP. However, there are some fintech start-ups that offer direct SIP options on their platform. Is a demat account necessary for starting a SIP? No. One does not need a demat account to start a SIP. As mentioned earlier, one can just start a SIP by opening an account — folio in industry parlance — through the fund house or the distributor. In fact, this is also one of the reasons for the increasing popularity of SIPs as one need not open a demat account through a stock broker. What are the benefits of a SIP? Timing the market is the most difficult thing when it comes to equity investment. SIPs, in a way, address this issue. SIPs capture every rise and fall of the market and hence, an investor need not worry about the level of the market. Also, there are sector-specific funds — pharma, banks, technology, etc. — and also those based on the size of the companies — such as large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap funds — that allow the investor to have a diversified portfolio rather than concentrate risk in a few companies.

What is missing in the 2019 election coverage|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|When the Election Commission (EC) announced that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address to the nation on Mission Shakti did not violate the Model Code of Conduct (MCC), it raised questions. The EC was forced to examine the issue following a formal complaint from the CPI(M) regarding the address. The EC arrived at the decision on the basis of a report submitted by a committee of officers. The committee found that the address was not live, and stated that Doordarshan’s source for the telecast was Asian News International. What the EC failed to explain is how this detail meant that the address did not violate the MCC. Autonomy of EC under a cloud When T.N. Seshan was the Chief Election Commissioner, the EC exercised its powers freely. Rules were not only implemented but were widely seen as being implemented. However, in the campaign to the 2019 general election, the autonomy of the constitutional body seems to be under a cloud. When the BJP displayed hoardings with Indian Air Force Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman’s photograph on them, the EC merely asked political parties to “desist from displaying photographs of defence personnel”. People do not expect the EC to behave weakly. The idea of having a strong leader and weak institutions is not endorsed by many in India. The India Digital News Report, published by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, revealed the many elements that are impacting journalism and the way people access news. Two findings stood out. The first is that fear lurks among Internet users in India, and there is trust in institutions to fix this system in which misinformation thrives. The survey covered English-speaking Indians. Nearly 55% of the respondents said that speaking their mind could get them into trouble with the authorities. Fifty per cent said they tend to “think carefully while expressing [their] political views openly on the Internet because this could make work colleagues or other acquaintances think differently” about them. The study says the levels of concern in India are comparable to those found in Brazil and Turkey. It pointed out that these high levels of concern could be based in part on recent events in India. Since 2012, at least 17 people have been arrested for posting material that was considered offensive or threatening to a politician. People who spoke out against Prime Minister Modi, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath were arrested. In December 2018, a journalist was jailed under the National Security Act for criticising the BJP and the Manipur Chief Minister. The second crucial finding is that 64% of the respondents, compared to just 41% in the U.S., felt that the government has a role in acting against disinformation. To better understand disinformation problems in India, the study asked its English-language Internet users about their exposure to, and concern over, different types of potentially problematic content that previous research for the Reuters Institute identified as examples of what the public associates with fake news and disinformation. The study revealed that people do not conflate issues and find ‘poor journalism’ to be hurting as much as disinformation. The categories include false news narrowly defined (stories that are completely made up for political or commercial reasons), and also hyperpartisan political content, whether from politicians, pundits, or publishers (stories in which facts are spun or twisted to push a particular agenda), poor journalism (stories that respondents consider marred by factual mistakes, inaccuracies, etc.), and more. Failure of the media A closer reading of both the Reuters study of the digital news space and Indian newspapers shows an obvious failure in Indian journalism. It has not examined the slow transformation of the EC from the T.N. Seshan model to the pre-1990s system. From issues relating to the allocation of symbols to smaller parties to the conduct of by-elections in a State like Tamil Nadu where nearly 10% of the Legislative Assembly is unrepresented, the media’s coverage of the election body is too gentle. readerseditor@thehindu.co.in

Pune LS seat: the Pawar factor in Pravin Gaikwad’s induction|Pune|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The ‘invisible hand’ of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar in Maratha community leader Pravin Gaikwad’s induction into the Congress has triggered resentment among the Pune Congress leadership, which itself is plagued with factionalism. Mr. Gaikwad’s entry on Saturday has put him in the forefront of the ticket race of the Pune Lok Sabha constituency. Mr. Gaikwad’s adhesion with the Congress, along with that of another community leader Shantaram Kunjir, is expected to help shore up support for the party from Marathas. Mr. Gaikwad, the district head of the social arm of the pro-Maratha Sambhaji Brigade and the secretary of the ‘Shetkari Kamgar Sanghatana’, had met Mr. Pawar a number of times in the past month. However, in a bid to downplay the NCP supremo’s ‘influence’ in the decision-making of a seat, which is traditionally a Congress bastion, the Pune NCP leadership refuted speculation that Mr. Pawar had ‘recommended’ Mr. Gaikwad’s name to the Congress. “While the Pune seat has traditionally remained with the Congress, the NCP, too, has a formidable vote share in the city,” Mr. Gaikwad had recently said. He further said that in order to defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), it is important that the Congress, the NCP, and Raj Thackeray’s Maharashtra Navnirman Sena as well as other like-minded outfits come together. “Even if Mr. Pawar has had talks with the Congress to suggest a suitable candidate for the Pune seat, I do not see anything wrong in this. The Congress has never fielded a strong Maratha candidate since 1992. It needs the right candidate to help it garner votes beyond its three lakh vote share in the city,” Mr. Gaikwad said. Earlier this week, Mr. Gaikwad announced his ‘withdrawal’ from the nomination race, claiming that the Congress had slighted dedicated activists like him while rolling out the red carpet for Bollywood actor Urmila Matondkar and giving her a ticket. This led the party to promptly induct Mr. Gaikwad, Mr. Kunjir, and their supporters at a formal ceremony in Mumbai in the presence of a visibly upset Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee chief Ashok Chavan. According to a party insider, Mr. Chavan is not too happy with Mr. Gaikwad’s induction, as he views him as Mr. Pawar’s ‘candidate’ forced upon the Congress owing to a lack of local alternatives. “Mr. Chavan had held a meeting of Pune Congress leaders in Diwali last year, who were aspirants for the Pune LS seat, exhorting them to sort their differences and unite lest Mr. Pawar began recommending his candidates. However, it proved inconclusive as the city’s Congress leaders have not succeeded in overcoming their differences,” he said. According to a political observer, yet another meeting to quell factionalism within the Pune Congress unit, presided over by Prithviraj Chavan and Harshawardhan Jadhav, yielded no result as well. “While the NCP may vehemently deny it, but Mr. Pawar’s weight in Mr. Gaikwad induction into the Congress and hopes for securing a ticket is evident. It remains to be seen whether the Congress grants him a ticket or sticks with its loyalists in Pune,” the observer said. Meanwhile, with no announcement of the Congress’ candidate for the Pune LS seat, the city Congress unit officially commenced its poll campaign on Sunday from Kasba Ganpati Temple.

Yahya Khan installs himself as Pak. President|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|General Yahya Khan assumed the office of President of Pakistan to-day [March 31], six days after taking over powers from Field Marshal Ayub Khan, it was officially announced in Rawalpindi. The Pakistan Government issued a statement saying that Gen. Yahya Khan was assuming the Presidency until a new Constitution was framed in Pakistan, which has been under martial law since Mr. Ayub Khan stepped down as President. The 52-year-old Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army who became the Chief Martial Law Administrator last Tuesday [March 25], as violence mounted in Pakistan, becomes the third President of the county. A tough veteran infantry officer of World War II, Gen. Yahya Khan succeeded President Ayub who himself took over from President Mirza in a bloodless coup in 1956.

Outdated financial advice parents should avoid giving|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Several of the 50-year-plus investors I know are eager to initiate their millennial children into investing as soon as possible. In their eagerness, they help their children with the ‘first steps.’ Sadly, those steps often constrain or cripple the millennial’s financial journey. It is terribly hard for me to tell the earnest parent how he (it’s mostly the father) has given advice that is not only outdated but simply wrong in today’s environment for two reasons: one, the millennials lead a very different working and personal life from their parents and therefore, have different financial needs. Two, the range of financial products and options available today are dramatically different from what their parents had when they started their careers. I seldom get to tell them this but here’s a list of such advice and why they should not be repeated. Buy an insurance policy With an average Indian, no investment journey begins without a policy and policy usually means LIC Pension Policy unless stated otherwise. A pension policy where one would get a handsome Rs. 8,000 per month after 25 years. Now, what exactly will the child do with just Rs. 8,000 a month, 25-35 years hence, even under a low inflation scenario? Even assuming it will just add to the rest of his income sources, what is the return? It may sum up to some measly returns of perhaps 4-5.5%! It is a different story entirely if you advise him to buy a pension policy soon after retirement. But tucking away his early earning years’ savings now in low earning products? That’s sad. The insurance policy a millennial needs may be very different. A term policy, if and when they have dependants, yes. And there may be others. For example, an insurance that helps sail through job loss or on diagnosis of major medical illness and so on. Let your children figure out what they need before you tie them down by gifting their first premium for their pension policy. ‘Relationship with bank’ If parents approved of any relationship of their millennial kids, it must be with their bank ‘relationship manager (RM).’ Investing in products suggested by the RM is important from the father’s perspective because one needs to be in the good books of the RM. For what exactly? Unlike those days, the millennial is unlikely to visit a branch for the rest of his/her life. There will be no occasion requesting for cheque clearance or asking for change in denominations of 10s and 50s; nor is a higher education loan dependent on how much you invested through the RM. Your millennials do not have to blindly listen to the RM’s advice. It could mean tying oneself to products one didn’t know had a lock-in, products that would incur high costs if exited early or that are sold as high dividend products, not knowing the risks involved. Anywhere between Rs. 1.5-2.5 lakh per annum of a young earner’s income is locked into investment products that are of little relevance to his/her financial goals. Let your millennials explore their journey and find out what suits them. They could go the traditional way to seek an adviser offline or through online channels or be a do-it-yourself investor by spending time on the web. But let them not invest for relationship’s sake. Buy a house right away “Real estate prices only go up, so I asked my son not to delay purchasing a house,” said an investor known to me. After all, the logic goes, the son has no commitments and can well pay his equated monthly instalment (EMI) and finish them early. But let’s get a few facts right: one, if you plan to leave your house to your children (most of you will), they are not going to be homeless. Second, you have no idea in which State or country your children are going to settle in. Third, if your children pay an EMI now, that will leave little surplus by way of savings for the next 15-20 years. Exactly what are they supposed to do for the rest of their life’s goals and aspirations? Fourth, EMI is not equal to rent, please! You could have a spacious 1,500 sq. ft house and pay a rent of one-third (or less) the cost of its EMI. Purchasing a house before settling into a career, before marriage or even before having kids (there is an ‘if’ component to all these in the millennial age) is not a good idea. And please remember, many millennials give up their jobs just after a few years to do their heart’s calling — be a stand-up comedian, travel and photography or be an observer of people. Call it crazy or deep, the fact is they may not even work like you did for the next 15-20 years after they take up a job. Let them decide what debt they want to take up. And please, don’t even think you are being a bad parent by not advising them. You will still have enough to advice on their spending habits (a new mobile every year!) and their not removing their headphone the whole time you’re talking to them!

Kartarpur focus|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|When India and Pakistan announced in November they would operationalise a corridor from Dera Baba Nanak in Punjab to Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara in Pakistan’s Punjab, it was hailed as a step forward in an otherwise fraught relationship. Prime Minister Narendra Modi appeared to share the optimism when he likened the initiative’s potential to the fall of the Berlin Wall. What has followed, however, is round upon round of wrangling between the two governments over every detail: from the number of pilgrims to be accommodated, to the security restrictions, to the documentation and mode of transport to be used by pilgrims. At the base of the differences is the deep distrust between the two governments, a chasm that has deepened in the aftermath of the Pulwama attack and the Balakot strike. Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s administration feels it should be given more credit for having cleared the Kartarpur proposal, something Indian Sikh pilgrims have demanded for decades, ever since the Radcliffe Line left their sacred shrine on the other side of the border in 1947. For its part, New Delhi refuses to acknowledge Pakistan’s overture, and has made it clear the corridor will have no connection with furthering bilateral talks on other issues. Meanwhile, security agencies have voiced concerns about a possible attempt by Pakistan’s military establishment to use the corridor to fuel separatist Khalistani sentiment. The Modi government’s decision now to postpone the next round of technical talks, which were scheduled for April 2, is driven mainly by those concerns, in particular the inclusion of some known Khalistan activists in a gurdwara committee that would interact with pilgrims from India. Last week, the Ministry of External Affairs summoned Pakistan’s Deputy High Commissioner and sought clarifications on the “controversial elements” on the committee, and said the next meeting would only be held after it receives Pakistan’s response. While none of the government’s concerns is unwarranted, it could not have been unprepared when it embarked on the corridor proposal. Pakistan’s support to separatist Sikh groups goes back several decades, and India must work to secure its border from the threat even as it opens the gates for thousands of pilgrims to travel to Pakistan. National security must get priority. But for this, there must be an effort by all stakeholders in India — the Centre, the State government and the leadership of the BJP, the Akalis and the Congress — to resist scoring political points against one another. Modalities and technical issues, such as on the numbers, eligibility and identity proof required for the trip to Kartarpur Sahib, should be ironed out by both governments. Putting off meetings is hardly a constructive solution, given the proposed opening by November to mark the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak.

Asian-origin gang funded al-Qaeda through tax fraud|London|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|A British-Asian gang of fraudsters may have been involved in misusing billions of pounds of British taxpayers’ money to fund terrorist networks in Pakistan and Afghanistan, claims a U.K. media investigation based on police and intelligence files. The gang is alleged to have sent 1% of its gains from its elaborate tax fraud to al-Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan, where it fundedmadrasas, training camps and other terrorist activities, according to the leaked files seen byThe Sunday Times. An estimated £80 million is believed to have been funnelled out by the fraudsters as part of an elaborate VAT and benefits fraud against the U.K.’s revenue department over the past two decades, with further gains made through mortgage and credit card fraud. Secret intelligence held by MI5 states that some of the money reached the Pakistani compound that housed the Al-Qaeda mastermind Osama bin Laden.

Saudis hacked Bezos’s phone: official|Seattle|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Jeff Bezos’ security consultant accused the Saudi government of gaining unauthorised access to the Amazon CEO’s phone, as part of an effort to harm the world’s richest man. In an opinion article inThe Daily Beaston Saturday, Gavin de Becker, Mr. Bezos’s security chief, alleged that the Saudis wanted to hurt Mr. Bezos because he ownsThe Washington Post. The Posthas aggressively reported on the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, one of its columnists, who was killed in October in Turkey. U.S. officials have concluded that Khashoggi, who was critical of Saudi leaders, was killed on the orders of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Mr. De Becker said he had turned over his findings about the Saudis and their role against Mr. Bezos to law enforcement. “Our investigators and several experts concluded with high confidence that the Saudis had access to Bezos’ phone, and gained private information,” Mr. De Becker wrote. The claims about the Saudis are difficult to verify and raise many questions. Throughout his article, the security consultant was vague on details. He did not reveal direct evidence of his accusations and wrote that he would not speak again publicly on the issue.  News on divorce The unusual set of circumstances began in January, when Mr. Bezos announced that he and his wife, MacKenzie Bezos, were divorcing. The next day,The National Enquirerpublished an exposé revealing that Mr. Bezos was romantically involved with Lauren Sanchez, a former Los Angeles TV anchor. Then in February, Mr. Bezos published a post on Medium accusing the parent ofThe Enquirer, American Media Inc., of “extortion and blackmail”. Mr. Bezos said AMI had threatened to publish graphic photographs of him, including a “below-the-belt selfie”, if he did not publicly affirm thatThe Enquirer’s reporting on his affair was not motivated by political concerns. He said AMI, which has had ties to the Saudis, was “apoplectic” aboutThe Post’s reporting on the Saudis. Earlier this month,The New York Timesreported that two people with direct knowledge ofThe Enquirer’s reporting said that everything the tabloid received on Mr. Bezos’s came from a single source.The Wall Street Journallater reported that AMI had paid Ms. Sanchez’s brother, Michael Sanchez, $2,00,000 for the texts. Riyadh’s involvement But Mr. De Becker on Saturday said the effort against Mr. Bezos went beyond Michael Sanchez and also involved the Saudis. Mr. De Becker pointed to an article published Saturday byThe New York Postin which Michael Sanchez saidThe Enquirer“had seen text exchanges between the secret couple” before he was in touch with the tabloid on the matter. He did not say whether the Saudis provided any of Mr. Bezos’s personal information from the phone to AMI. Mr. De Becker said his investigation included interviews with cybersecurity experts and “people who personally know the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.”

32-yr-old Indian dentist killed in road accident in US|Washington|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|  Dr. Arshad Mohammed, 32, an Indian dentist pursuing an advanced medical course in the U.S., was among two persons killed in a road accident in Chicago, police said.

Some soup, with a dash of health|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|What came as an idea in 1998 to use naturally available herbs and plants to cure his mother’s rheumatoid arthritis has now taken roots in the form of cafes selling ‘food as medicine and medicine as food.’ G. Maran of Sivakasi, who claims that regular intake of sprouted cereals andmudakkathan(balloon vine) soup obviated the need for knee replacement for his mother, started theThaai Vazhi Iyarkkai Unavagamwith a meagre investment of Rs. 50,000 to sell three varieties of soup. Today, he offers 25 varieties of soups and juices to more than 300 customers every day. Inspired by his model, similar cafes have sprung up at 43 places in Tamil Nadu and Bengaluru. Explaining his model, Mr. Maran says that his idea is to sell ‘positive food’ to health and beauty-conscious people, using authentic plants supplied by small farmers. He started selling sproutedurad dhalin packets, travelling all over Sivakasi on a bicycle. Later, a two-wheeler helped him in multiplying sale. Today, about 7,000 packets of sprouts are sold all over the town. “My target is the lower middle and working class people who cannot afford costly medicines and treatment. Awareness of traditional medicinal food is much more now, thanks to the Internet,” he says. At all naturopathy classes he attended and institutes he visited, Mr. Maran had been told to bring down the medical expenses of a family. Hence, the maximum cost of an item at the cafe is Rs. 25. He follows time-tested, traditional methods to add value to ordinary herbs and vegetables. For example, the aloe vera juice offered at the cafe, a hot seller, is called ‘Sivakasi Jigarthanda.’ The curry leaf juice, made with coconut milk is a hit among girl students as they believe that it prevents hair loss. Small farmers of the rain-fed area bring plants found in the wild and cultivated by them to the cafe. “I pay them more than what they normally get in the market. One kg ofaavaram poo(cassia auriculata) fetches Rs. 90 in the market but I pay them Rs. 200,” he says. On Sundays, farmers bring organically grown greens and vegetables for display and sale to the cafe. This sale, calledThaalanmai Uzhavar Santhai(Benevolent Farmers’ Market), happens between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. Stakeholders benefit Mr. Maran says that this model is beneficial to all stakeholders. While the farmer gets a higher price, the entrepreneur realises a handsome profit through traditional value-addition and consumers get real value for their money. He is of the view that this model, which entails low investment, is ideal for small farmers and jobless educated youth in small towns. It also provides employment to women. In Sivakasi, women thrown out of employment from fireworks units, make soups and juices at his outlet. He says,”My dream is to encourage young entrepreneurs to start one such cafe in every street.”

The arrogance of the ignorant|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|When the tsunami hit the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in 2004, thousands perished. However, some of the oldest Adivasi tribes, the Jarawas and the Onges, lost nobody. These communities followed animals to the highlands well before the waves hit. Formal education was of little survival value in a context where you needed swift instincts. When Western drug and pharma corporations send their scouts to remote regions in India to look for herbs to patent, the scouts do not consult top Indian doctors or scientists first. They smuggle their way into jungles inhabited by Adivasis where, in a moment of weakness, an elderly woman adept in the healing arts may divulge a secret or two. Later, the companies might test the herb in their labs and find that the woman’s claims were correct. This has long been the staple of biopiracy. That those forests inhabited by Adivasis are some of the best conserved in the subcontinent is a long-standing fact contrary to the understanding of supposedly educated Indians. What is invaluable is what is often described as ‘indigenous knowledge’ — as though the knowledge gained over centuries of lived experience is of somehow lower valency than the literacy acquired in a school, or perhaps of no value at all. Relationship with nature Sadly, the articulate arrogance of ‘New India’ is such that it is unable to see any virtue in the lives of Adivasis and other forest-dwellers who have lived in and by the forests since times immemorial. Ensconced as it is in the air-conditioned offices of metropolitan India, duly estranged from any living ecology of the earth, while fully predatory on it, it sees people who live in and by the jungles as ‘underdeveloped’ criminals who are among those responsible for the thinning of the forests. This appears to be the view held by petitioners, including retired forest officers and conservation NGOs, in a lawsuit filed in the Supreme Court in 2008. They seem to believe that humans are not a part of nature and can never coexist with it. It is far from their imagination to distinguish between Adivasis who know something about living sensibly with nature and the rest of us, who do not. That even the courts would fall to such abysmal levels of understanding has become a defining feature of the reforms era. On February 13, the Supreme Court ruled that over 1.12 million households from 17 States, who have had their claims rejected under the Forest Rights Act (FRA) 2006, are to be evicted by the State governments before July 27. It is not clear what fraction of these are individual claims and what fraction are community claims. Nor are all of these Adivasi households. Some might fall under the ‘other traditional forest-dwellers’ category. Critically, the Central government failed to send its attorney to the court. Ironically, the FRA contains no legal provision for the eviction of rejected claimants. In the face of loud protests from around the country, the court issued a stay order (till July 10) on its ruling. This suits the political goals of the incumbent BJP as it prepares for the polls. Many States are yet to give their details to the courts. Once they do, the number of households to be evicted may rise. Close to 8-10% of the Adivasi population may be asked to vacate their traditional homes and abandon their livelihoods. Has the court contemplated the gravity of the implications? Where are these people supposed to live and make a living? What justice is there in acting in such an inhumane manner? It betrays ignorance. The judges know that we live in an ecologically imperilled time when metropolitan India has much to answer for its corporate-consumer excesses. And yet, it is among the weakest and the wisest that they choose to attack. The world’s largest refinery is coming up in the Konkan, uprooting 17 villages, over half a million cashew trees and over a million mango trees. Thousands of acres of Himalayan forests and over a hundred villages will be submerged by one of the world’s tallest dams coming up in Pancheshwar in Uttarakhand. Are the conservationist petitioners and courts doing anything to stop any of this? They show little courage when it comes to tackling the land mafias, builder-developers, realtors, constructors and miners, but their conscience is ablaze over conserving Adivasis in the jungles. A dying civilisation This is the arrogance of ignorant India and it shall not abdicate till it has laid to rest the last hopes of what was ‘a wounded civilisation’, and is now a dying one. For, let us be clear about one thing: freeing the forests of their traditional inhabitants is almost certain to expose their erstwhile habitats in short order to the speedy, organised depredations of the forces of what has come to be seen by the elites as ‘development’. If remote habitats are emptied of Adivasis, there may be nobody to forewarn us when ecologically perilous tipping points are crossed in the future. To make matters worse, worrying amendments that have been proposed to the Indian Forest Act, 1927, which further strengthen the stranglehold of forest officials over India’s jungles and its inhabitants, have now been made public. Perhaps some day, when their decisions affect them, the folly of their pronouncements will dawn upon those who preside on the fates of millions today. But it shall be too late then. Before July, the safe-keepers of justice might wish to ponder Gandhi’s words: “A time is coming when those, who are in the mad rush today of multiplying their wants, vainly thinking that they add to the real substance, real knowledge of the world, will retrace their steps and say: ‘What have we done?’” Aseem Shrivastava is a Delhi-based writer and teaches Ecosophy at Ashoka University; Abhinav Gupta is an independent researcher who has worked on forest issues and the FRA

Warehouse of knowledge|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|What is the meaning of ‘not my first rodeo’? (N Bhanu, Hyderabad) First, let us deal with the pronunciation of ‘rodeo’. The ‘rod’ is pronounced like the word ‘road’ and the ‘eo’; sounds like the ‘io’ in ‘radio’. One way of pronouncing the word is ‘ROAD-i-yo’ — with the stress on the first syllable. A rodeo is an event in which people, usually cowboys, get a chance to display their various skills - riding a bull or a horse, wrestling a cow, roping a calf, etc. The people who take part in these rodeos are usually highly skilled and experienced. Therefore, when someone tells you something and you respond by saying, “This is not my first rodeo” or “This ain’t my first rodeo”, what you are suggesting is that this is not the first time you are doing something. You are experienced, and therefore, the other individual need not worry because you know what it is you are doing. The expression is mostly used in informal contexts in American English. Sunil is not at all worried about tomorrow’s presentation. He’s made many before. This is not his first rodeo. Don’t worry. Hema is not going to be nervous. This ain’t her first rodeo. She’s been in several finals before this. What is the difference between ‘godown’ and ‘warehouse’? (K Manjula, Trichy) In terms of meaning, very little. Both words can refer to a relatively large building that can be used to store materials of different kinds. Native speakers of English also use the word ‘warehouse’ to refer to any large store, retail or wholesale, which sells a product at a low price. Although the two words are listed in most dictionaries, all of them suggest that ‘godown’ is mostly limited to eastern Asia; it is most frequently used in India. Some dictionaries define it as ‘Indian English for warehouse’. ‘Godown’ is seldom used in native varieties of English; in fact, most native speakers may not even be aware of its existence. Unlike ‘godown’, the word ‘warehouse’ can be used as a verb as well. Atul’s company specialises in building warehouses/godowns. The students went to a discount electronic warehouse to buy their computer. If you ask me, it makes more sense to warehouse our entire inventory in one place. How is the word ‘behemoth’ pronounced? (Rajesh Trivedi, Jaipur) This rather formal word consists of three syllables. The first ‘e’ sounds like the ‘i’ in ‘sit’, ‘bit’ and ‘kit’; the second sounds like the ‘ee’ in ‘bees’, ‘sees’; and ‘knees’. The final syllable is pronounced like the word ‘moth’. The word is pronounced ‘bi-HEE-moth’ with the stress on the second syllable. According to scholars, the word comes from the Hebrew ‘b’hemah’ meaning ‘beast’. People believe ‘behemoth’ was first used to refer to the hippopotamus. When the word was borrowed into English, it was used to refer to any large animal. With the passage of time, however, the word began to be used with anything that was enormous in size and very powerful. For example, it is very common nowadays to refer to a huge organisation as a behemoth. It’s about time that the auto industry stopped manufacturing such gas guzzling behemoths. If the two companies merge, it’ll result in a behemoth that most industrialists will fear. ******** “Never approach a bull from the front, a horse from the rear or a fool from any direction.”Unknown The author teaches at the English and Foreign Languages University, Hyderabad. upendrankye@gmail.com

‘Date fixed to execute drug offenders’|Colombo|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|President Maithripala Sirisena on Sunday said he had fixed a date to execute convicted drug traffickers, reiterating his earlier announcement on restoring the death penalty in Sri Lanka. He was speaking at an event on drug prevention, attended by religious heads representing different faiths, and underscored his resolve to eradicate the problem of illegal drug trafficking, braving “any challenge” that might come his way, a press statement issued by the President’s Media Division said. “A schedule is ready,” he said. Amid what officials call “a heightening drug menace”, President Sirisena announced in February that the death penalty would be restored to combat the problem. Sri Lanka has a four decade-long moratorium on capital punishment and his controversial decision lifting that has drawn considerable criticism from international rights watchdogs and local civil society. Further, authorities advertised for the job of a hangman and received over 100 applications, according to a Reuters report early March. According to media reports, at least 25 people have been convicted for drug trafficking. Meanwhile, the Police Special Task force has said it was dismantling the underground network, making a series of arrests and seizing huge quantities of heroin and other narcotics frequently.

Maldives court lifts freeze on Yameen’s bank accounts|Male|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|A Maldivian court on Sunday ordered the authorities to lift a freeze on former President Abdulla Yameen’s bank accounts holding about $6.5 million but said a money laundering case against him would proceed. The High Court overturned the Criminal Court’s earlier decision to freeze the eight accounts over allegations that Mr. Yameen had received illicit payments just before he lost his re-election bid in September. Mr. Yameen was arrested last month on a charge of trying to bribe witnesses in his money laundering trial, but was released from custody on Thursday. The move came ahead of April 6 parliamentary elections contested by his Progressive Party of Maldives. Authorities believe millions of dollars allegedly siphoned off by Mr. Yameen could be stashed abroad, and have said that talks are under way with foreign entities to repatriate any cash found. Mr. Yameen’s chief lawyer and former Justice Minister Azima Shakoor is also facing charges of embezzlement and helping her boss to launder money.

Corporator killed over water dispute|Mumbai|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Shiv Sena corporator Amardeep Rode was hacked to death on Sunday morning allegedly by two of his friends following a scuffle over water in Parbhani district, the police said. “Rode, a corporator with the Parbhani Municipal Corporation, had intervened after some women complained about getting less water from a public tap in the area,” an official said. “A pit had been dug near the water tap to draw out excess quantities and Rode objected to this. His friend Ravi Gaikwad is reported to have dug the pit and Rode went to ask him about it. An altercation ensued during which Rode tried to attack Gaikwad with an axe,” the official said. Rode’s friend Kiran Dake tried to stop him from escalating the argument but the former attacked him as well, he said. “Mr. Gaikwad overpowered Rode and hit him with the axe. Mr. Gaikwad and Mr. Dake then assaulted Rode with stones and sticks, killing him instantly. The two have surrendered to the police,” he said. A case of murder has been registered at Mondha police station.

Biden denies allegations of misconduct|Washington|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Former Vice-President Joe Biden insisted on Sunday that he had never acted inappropriately towards women as a growing row about a kiss on the campaign trail cast a shadow over his expected run for the White House. Mr. Biden is the clear favorite to win the Democrat nomination to take on Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election even though he has yet to declare his candidacy. But several of his rivals have now weighed in on the allegations from a former State lawmaker who has recalled being “mortified” when he had planted a “big, slow kiss” on the back of her head on the sidelines of a rally five years ago. “In my many years on the campaign trail and in public life, I have offered countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support and comfort. And not once — never — did I believe I acted inappropriately,” Mr. Biden said in his statement. “If it is suggested that I did so, I will listen respectfully. But it was never my intention.

‘Our role will be to find new business models that can make water much more accessible’|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Grundfos A/S, the world’s biggest pump manufacturer in terms of value and volume, is aiming to be a major catalyst in sustainability by solving water challenges and climate change issues. In an interview withThe Hindu,Mads Nipper, CEO & global president, Grundfos, said the Danish company, by supplying energy efficient pumps, can help reduce 50% of energy consumed by water pumps globally.Edited excerpts: What do you see as potential threats to environment and what can Grundfos do about it? I personally believe that the world’s two biggest potential risks right now are climate change and water challenges. And even we are not a huge company, we are only $4 billion. It is fascinating to think how we have good chances to be one of the world’s most important companies in addressing water and climate change challenges. 10% of the world’s electricity is consumed by pumps and that can be reduced to half with the existing technology. Many other water problems that people are facing are solvable. The technical solutions are here. My dream is that Grundfos becomes a catalyst for other companies to structurally start addressing those challenges. We are a water and energy efficient company that happens to be the biggest pump manufacturer of the world. How challenging are climate change and water scarcity and as a company, how are you addressing it? As per the global risk report by the World Economic Forum, six out of the 10 greatest risks faced by humanity are directly related to climate change and water. These are the biggest risks humanity faces. There, of course, will be wind turbines and solar panels creating substantially more renewable energy. But for the next 10 to 20 years, it will be incredibly important to combat climate change. Digital solutions to not only optimise the pumps, but also the systems in which those pumps are seated will have a huge potential. On water, our role will be to bring solutions and technologies that can make these work a lot better, and find new business models that can make water much more accessible. India has seven to 10 million diesel submersible pumps, which is a disaster, because diesel-driven pumps are not reliable and are polluting. So, how can we be a catalyst to replace all that with sustainable solar power solutions? We can’t do that ourselves, but can help the government find business models for that. Those are the kinds of ambitions we have. The same thing is in sub-Saharan Africa. There are hundreds of millions of people living without access to basic water. But they all have mobile phones. So, how we can create a micro payments ecosystem to make clean water available to those who essentially pay symbolic fees for accessing clean water. Investing in those business models and working with partners is some thing we can do through technology. How challenging was it to turn the company around? At Grundfos, technology has been developed at one place in the world, up here. We decided to spread out. So, more R&D is now happening in India, China and the U.S. In 2013-14, when Grundfos had profits declining for five years in a row, the short-term task was to get that back to a decent level. Not that we had greedy owners, but if you want to invest for the long term, you need to have decent earnings. So, the first two years for me was very much about getting to know Grundfos and not just the product, but also spirit and the soul of the company, and then it was to make it relatively a classic financial turnaround. And the future is about strengthening the current business of pumps. But building much more on top of that is the digital journey. Digitalisation will play a huge role. Your company is 85% owned by the Foundation. How about your spending on charity?  The Foundation has in its charter that to be a good owner, we must spend on water research and water access for the world’s poorest and for education and local society. We give between $20 and $30 million every year in charity. I am happy and proud that Grundfos makes solutions that do really good things. And, we can make some money in doing it. Our Foundation, Bills Gates and Melinda Gates Foundation and Tata Trusts do a great thing through charity. In Africa, we supplied water to almost a million people. It made a huge difference to the families when they got access to water. When women and girls do not spend five hours to fetch water, they will have time to go to school and do productive things. We got paid for our services, but in the process helped changed lives. (The interviewer was in Denmark at the invitation of Grundfos)  For the next 10 to 20 years, it will be incredibly important to combat climate change

Slovaks elect first woman President|Bratislava|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The election of Zuzana Caputova as Slovakia’s first woman President was greeted on Sunday as a vote for change, with the anti-graft activist expected to provide a check on a government tarnished after last year’s murder of a journalist. The 45-year-old environmental lawyer’s clear victory on Saturday over the ruling party’s candidate was a blow to the populist-left Smer-SD — the largest grouping in Parliament — and could spell trouble for them in the EU elections and next year’s general vote. Ms. Caputova won 58.4% of the vote according to a final tally of results released Sunday, compared with 41.6% for her ruling party rival, EU Energy Commissioner Maros Sefcovic. “Let us look for what connects us. Let us promote cooperation above personal interests,” she said as the results rolled in.

Healthy capital ratios, low NPAs|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The RBI’s policy rate cut in February this year is likely to nudge banks to trim deposit rates over the coming months. Though a sharp cut is unlikely in the near term, depositors with surplus funds should consider locking into attractive rates now. DCB Bank offers 8.05% for deposits with tenure of 15 months to less than 24 months. It also offers 8.05% on its 36-month deposit. Lock-in now Banks had raised deposit rates last year with those in the private sector hiking rates more aggressively. With the RBI expected to cut the policy rate further in the coming months, retail deposit rates offered by banks are likely to fall too. Hence, shop for higher rates now.  Attractive option DCB Bank’s 8.05% is among the best offered by traditional banks currently. Most other banks offer 6.5-7.5% for two to three year deposits — though there are a few others such as IDFC First Bank that offer 8.25% for a 731-day deposit. Small finance banks offer a rate closer to 9%. So which tenure should you chose from? A two-year option can work well as it mitigates the uncertainty over reinvestment risk — inability to reinvest at the existing rate. The shorter tenure can also allow you to cash in on any rate hikes two years or so hence. Given that interest rate cycles have become relatively shorter over the past two to three years, sudden reversal in rates (from rate easing now to hikes) cannot be ruled out. If you are looking for a longer horizon to park you funds, the36 months deposit is also a good option. Remember, bank deposits score on safety over options such as deposits in NBFCs (non-banking finance companies) or non-convertible debentures (NCDs). Bank deposits are covered by the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation of India (DICGC). Each depositor is insured up to Rs. 1 lakh for principal and interest. About DCB Bank DCB Bank, under the aegis of the with a new management since 2009, had shifted its focus towards secured lending, which has helped it tide over its asset quality issues. It had delivered a healthy 25% annual growth in advances between FY13 and FY18 while the profit grew 19% annually during this period. In the December 2018 quarter, net advances grew by 23% YoY while profit after tax increased by 51%. Healthy growth in core net interest income, other income boost and favourable cost to income aided earnings. The bank predominantly focuses on mortgages, and the SME segment. It has been able to maintain its asset quality — its gross non-performing assets (GNPA) as a percentage of loans ranged between 1.5% and 1.9% over the last five fiscal years. As of December 2018, gross NPAs stood at around 1.9% per cent. However, DCB’s scale of operations is still modest, and so are its return ratios. As of December 2018, the bank’s return on assets stood at 1% while return on equity stood at 12.6%. Investments in branch expansion and technology have kept profitability modest. Nonetheless, the bank’s steady focus on SME, new branches expected to achieve scale, and healthy capital ratios lend comfort to earnings. (The purpose of this column is to provide information.

Axelsen emerges victor over Srikanth|NEW DELHI|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Viktor Axelsen continues to be on a roll. Looking fiercely determined to win back his World No. 1 spot, the lanky Dane got the measure of K. Srikanth after saving two game-points to regain the men’s singles title in the India Open badminton here on Sunday. The World No. 4, who won 15 straight points to open a 3-0 lead in the second game, battled from 18-20 down to win 21-7, 22-20. This was Srikanth’s fourth defeat to Axelsen in five encounters since March 2017. After Srikanth failed to retrieve from his back-hand, Axelsen was quick to toss away his racquet and black T-shirt into the crowd. Jubilation In the time between he won the match and received the trophy, medal and the cheque of $26,500, Axelsen kept pumping his fist in jubilation, a reflection of what it meant for him to the title again. In 2017, Axelsen won here and went on to claim the World title. On a day of one-sided finals, the 2013 champion and former World champion Ratchanok Intanon, too, regained the women singles title by stopping China’s He Bingjiao 21-15, 21-14 in a contest that did not rise to expectations. For Srikanth, who won in 2015 by beating Axelsen in the final, the biggest takeaway from the 36-minute defeat was the way he fought back from 9-12 in the second game to hold two game-points. The match, where some of the rallies were played at a furious pace, saw the players fight on an even keel in the second game after Alexsen ran away with the opening game in just 11 minutes. Fightback Srikanth who got his confidence back following some fine touch-play at the net in the second game, forced several errors from the Dane and looked like setting up the decider, like in most of his matches this week. However, it was at 18-20 that Axelsen’s courageous play paid off. After Srikanth found the tram-line, Axelsen pounced on a short return and made it 20-all. A favourable net-chord brought in match-point and Axelsen closed out a long rally with a forehand cross-court that left Srikanth stretching low on his backhand. Reflecting on the match, Srikanth said, “I think I gave him too many chances in the first game to attack. I did fairly well in the second, and maybe, if there would have been a decider, I would have had better chances.” The results (final):  Men: Viktor Axelsen (Den) bt K. Srikanth 21-7, 22-20. Doubles: Lee Yang & Wang Chi-Lin (Tpe) bt Rickey Karandasuwardi & Angga Pratama 21-14, 21-14. Women: Ratchanok Intanon (Tha) bt He Bingjiao 21-15, 21-14. Doubles: Greysia Polii & Apriyani Rahayu (Ina) bt Chow Mei Kuan & Lee Meng Yean (Mal) 21-11, 25-23. Mixed doubles: Wang Yilyu & Huang Dongping (Chn) bt Praveen Jordan & Melati Daeva Oktavianti (Ina) 21-13, 21-11.

Dramatic win for Hamilton|SAKHIR|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Defending World champion Lewis Hamilton took advantage of Ferrari new boy Charles Leclerc’s wretched misfortune on Sunday when he claimed a dramatic victory for Mercedes in the Bahrain Grand Prix. The five-time champion, who looked to be heading for second behind the 21-year-old Monegasque, gained the lead with 10 laps remaining when Formula One’s new star, who claimed a record-breaking pole position for Ferrari on Saturday, was hit by engine problems. As he slowed, Hamilton hunted him down to claim his first win of the season, his third at the Bahrain International Circuit and the 74th of his career ahead of his Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas. Leclerc came third as the race finished behind a Safety Car, following the spectacular late exit of Renaults at Turn Two, ahead of Max Verstappen of Red Bull. Stoic response “It happens,” said a calm Leclerc afterwards. “It’s part of motor sport. It’s a very hard one to take, but I am sure we will come back stronger.” Four-time champion Sebastian Vettel finished fifth in the second Ferrari, after a late spin had damaged his front wing during a duel with Hamilton, ahead of British rookie Lando Norris who scored his first points for McLaren in sixth. Kimi Raikkonen was seventh for Alfa Romeo ahead of Pierre Gasly of Red Bull, Thailand’s rookie Alex Albon of Toro Rosso, who also had his first points finish, and Mexican Sergio Perez of Racing Line. “That was unfortunate for Charles, he drove a great race,” said Hamilton. “We’ve got work to do to keep these guys off our tails. It must be devastating for Charles.”  The results (top-10): 1. Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) 1hr 34min 21.836sec; 2. Valtteri Bottas (Mercedes) +2.980; 3. Charles Leclerc (Ferrari) 6.131; 4. Max Verstappen (Red Bull) 6.408; 5. Sebastian Vettel (Ferrari) 36.068; 6. Lando Norris (McLaren) 45.754; 7. Kimi Raikkonen (Alfa Romeo) 47.470; 8. Pierre Gasly (Red Bull) 58.094; 9. Alexander Albon (Toro Rosso) 1:02.697; 10. Sergio Perez (Mercedes) 1:03.696.  Best lap: Leclerc (Ferrari) 1:33.411, 38th. Standings after two rounds (top-5): Drivers: 1. Bottas (44 points); 2. Hamilton (43); 3. Verstappen (27); 4. Leclerc (26); 5. Vettel (22).  Constructors (top-5): 1. Mercedes (87); 2. Ferrari (48); 3. Red Bull (31); 4. Alfa Romeo (10); 5. McLaren (8).

CSK does what CSK does best — win from a precarious position|Chennai|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|It was what fans in Chennai had waited for years now — M.S. Dhoni, in yellow, wielding his big blade at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium to lay the base for Chennai Super Kings’s victory in the Indian Premier League. Walking in at 27 for three, Dhoni played one of his classic innings. He ran hard between the wickets at the start before unleashing the big shots towards the end. His unbeaten 75 off just 46 balls was in danger of being upstaged by Rajasthan Royals’s Ben Stokes but some smart bowling by Dwayne Bravo at the death ensured an eight-run win for the hosts here on Sunday. Electing to bowl, Royals’ pacers Dhawal Kulkarni and Jofra Archer steamed in with aggression and tied CSK’s top order down with probing lines. Early wickets Ambati Rayudu was the first to go, surprised by a slow bouncer from Archer that followed him. The edge was taken by the keeper Jos Buttler. Shane Watson soon cut one straight to Archer at short third-man off Stokes. Dhoni and Suresh Raina then steadied the ship after Kedar Jadhav was dismissed by Kulkarni. The duo went about setting a platform with a 61-run stand for the fourth wicket with some sensible batting against the spinners. Rush of blood Just when he was looking good picking boundaries off the tweakers, Raina played a poor shot trying to give himself room and clear the cover boundary. He only ended up being bowled by a slower one from Jaydev Unadkat for 36. But Bravo consolidated alongside Dhoni with a 16-ball 27. They smashed 24 runs in the 18th over, bowled by Kulkarni, to give the innings a much-needed momentum. The skipper seemed to mark out Unadkat as the bowler to target. Dhoni picked his first two boundaries off him before thrashing the left-arm pacer for three sixes off the final three deliveries of the innings. In the final 10 overs CSK made 120, 76 coming off the last five as it made 175. Stuttering start Royals’s innings stuttered at the start like CSK’s. Deepak Chahar removed Ajinkya Rahane and Sanju Samson while Shardul Thakur accounted for the dangerous Buttler to reduce the visitors to 14 for three. Steve Smith and Rahul Tripathi then kept Royals in the hunt with a 61-run partnership for the fourth wicket before Imran Tahir turned the tide in the home side’s favour by removing both batsmen in quick succession. Towards the end, Stokes and Archer played valiant knocks. But with 12 needed off the last over, Bravo produced an excellent final over especially after going for 19 in his previous one. He gave away just three and picked two wickets.

RLD goes all out to regain its Baghpat bastion|BAGHPAT|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The residents of Tukali, a Dalit hamlet, finally heaved a sigh of relief when the linesman arrived and climbed the electric pole. They had spent almost a day without electricity. As the linesman stood precariously on the row of horizontal wires and worked, the Dalits waited below impatiently, recounting their daily struggles. They complained it was usual for the administration to disregard their grievances, pointing to the poor condition of the roads and joblessness created by the shutting down of local factories post-demonetisation. “We want Modi to lose. He is bent against us. We are not given any facilities,” said Pradeep Jatav, summarising the mood of the Dalits. In 2014, BJP’s Satyapal Singh, former Mumbai top cop, trounced SP’s Ghulam Mohammad by over two lakh votes, while Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) chief Ajit Singh was relegated to the third position in his bastion. This time, the contest is polarised between two Jats: Union Minister Satyapal Singh and Ajit Singh’s son Jayant Chaudhary. To make up the deficit — the RLD trailed the BJP by 2.23 lakh votes — Jayant is relying on the SP and the BSP, with the latter providing the solid votebank of Jatavs, like those in Tukali. “Even if she [Mayawati] nominates a pup, our vote will go with it. We will vote for Jayant Chaudhary,” said a Jatav resident. Communal divide While communal polarisation following the Muzaffarnagar riots and the breakdown of the Jat-Muslim relationship pushed the BJP to a big win here in 2014, the combined vote of the SP, the BSP and the RLD — 5.54 lakh — was still 1.30 lakh more than the BJP. Jats and Muslims are the two largest groups in the constituency, once held by Chaudhary Charan Singh. While Muslims are strongly backing the RLD, the mood among the Jats is mixed. Those supporting him cited non-payment of cane dues, increase in power tariffs and joblessness under the BJP government. Those in favour of Satyapal Singh praised him for building roads while also expressing support towards Mr. Modi and viewed the alliance with disdain. By a local BSP leader’s own admission, “around 40%” of the Jats are still with the BJP, as Satyapal Singh is a local jat. “Even if this increases further, it will be compensated by the support of our base votes — Jatavs, Yadavs and Muslims —- which have been consolidated,” he said. For the BJP, victory depends on not just the Jats, but also the consolidation of Gurjars, OBCs like Kashyaps and Sainis and the BJP’s bedrock, the upper castes. A few kilometres from Tukali, Sumit Kumar, a Gurjar, runs an eatery outside a police check-post. He is firmly behind the BJP and hails PM Modi for giving the forces a free hand [Balakot airstrike]. “The road outside was built by the BJP. It used to have potholes earlier,” adds Sumit. In the 2017 Assembly polls, the only seat the RLD won was Chhaprauli in Baghpat. However, soon after, its lone MLA Sahendra Ramala, a Jat, was expelled for cross-voting during the Rajya Sabha polls and joined the BJP. To connect with the Jats and farmers, the RLD is relying on the legacy of Jayant’s grandfather, Chaudhary Charan Singh. “It’s true our relationship is old, but here I'm standing like a blank paper. People need to make a new start,” said Jayant, addressing a nukkad sabha in Shabanpur village. Appealing to farmers, he said his father Ajit Singh had “fought for them” even while not in power. BJP president Amit Shah, who addressed a rally in support of Satyapal Singh in Baghpat on Sunday, used Charan Singh to target dynasty politics. “By not making his son his [political] heir, Chaudhary Sahab sent a very big message to U.P....Whoever works for the farmers and development of the area, he will be the heir of Chaudhary Charan Singh,” said Mr. Shah. ‘Bhavna v/s Bhavishya’ Satyapal Singh himself believes that the youth won’t fall for “bhavna” (emotions) but will vote for “bhavishya” (future). Starting off his campaign from his native village Basauli last week, he dismissed the arithmetic of the anti-BJP alliance, saying “only chemistry” will work in Baghpat. “People will set aside their caste, community and religion and vote for development, governance and security,” he told reporters.

Reds hang on with nervy win|London|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Late goals from Cesar Azpilicueta and Ruben Loftus-Cheek helped Chelsea complete a thrilling comeback to beat Cardiff City 2-1 away in the Premier League on Sunday. With Chelsea heading for an embarrassing defeat against third-bottom Cardiff, its captain Azpilicueta dragged it back with a goal that appeared to be offside. The visitors then completed the fightback when substitute Loftus-Cheek stormed in at the back post to plant a header in the bottom corner. Chelsea is sixth in the table with 60 points, level with fifth-placed Arsenal, which has played a game fewer, and a point behind Manchester United in fourth.

Will fight for Punjab’s autonomy within the Union: PDA|CHANDIGARH|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|With a focus on Punjab-centric issues, the Punjab Democratic Alliance (PDA) is all set to take on mainstream parties as it aims to fight for a “genuine federal system” with more powers and autonomy to the States. PDA – the coalition of Bahujan Samaj Party, Punjabi Ekta Party, Lok Insaaf Party, Nawan Punjab Party, Communist Party of India (CPI), Revolutionary Marxist Party of India (RMPI) and Marxist Communist Party of India (U) have announced a common minimum programme (CMP) for the 2019 Parliamentary polls as the alliance prepares to contest all the 13 Lok Sabha seats, which go for polls on May 19. “The alliance has been forged to liberate Punjab from the clutches of traditional parties such as the Congress, Shiromani Akali Dal SAD, Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP), etc., that have ruined the State in turns for the past many decades. We aspire for a federal and democratic India as an alternative to the conventional political parties monopolising the power and resources of Punjab,” Dharamvira Gandhi, the suspended Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Member of Parliament from Patiala, who has recently floated Nawan Punjab Party, toldThe Hindu. “We want autonomy to States within the Indian Union. The entire resources and wealth generation is within the States. Yet they are beggars and the Centre is in a stronger position. This needs to be changed,” said Mr. Gandhi.  Unkept promises Hitting out at the successive governments in Punjab, Mr. Gandhi said in Punjab - farmers, labourers, dalits or small business persons - all are suffering due to the indifferent attitude and wrong policies of the State as well as the Centre. “The youth is shattered by unemployment and is running abroad or taking recourse to drugs. Promises by the ruling Congress of waiving of farmers’ loans, jobs for each family and the oath of eliminating drugs in four weeks have all evaporated,” said Mr. Gandhi. Pointing out that PDA stands committed on issue-based, clean and accountable politics, Mr. Gandhi said through its CMP, the PDA would fight for the long- pending demands of Punjab - be it the river waters issue, territorial disputes, rightful claim to the capital city of Chandigarh - and a true federal system with more powers and autonomy to the states. “We will also fight for complete waiving of farmers’/agricultural workers’ loans and getting the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission implemented,” said Mr. Gandhi.  ‘Addicts as patients’ He added to tackle the drugs menace, Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act needs to be tweaked. “Thousands of drug addicts are in jails while the big-fish, who control the drug trade are wandering free because they enjoy political patronage. The alliance demands to treat addicts as patients and extend them free treatment, and deal firmly with the drug mafia,” he said.  People are suffering in Punjab because of wrong policies of the State as well as the Centre Dharamvira GandhiNPP chief and part of PDA

Title No. 101 for Federer|Miami|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Ashleigh Barty’s transformation is complete after the Australian defeated Czech fifth seed Karolina Pliskova 7-6(1), 6-3 to win the biggest singles title of her career at the WTA Miami Open. The 22-year-old Aussie quit tennis five years ago after finding the mental grind of the tour too much to bear, turning to professional cricket in a bid to find sporting happiness. Barty, however, knew she had the tennis skills to compete at the very top and after returning in February 2016, has taken her career to an elite level, culminating in her first-ever WTA Premier Mandatory title to follow on from the US Open doubles crown she won last September. Barty, a junior Wimbledon winner at age 15, will rise from 11th to No. 9 in the world rankings and become the first Australian woman since Sam Stosur in June 2013 to crack the top 10. “It feels like it’s a long time ago now since I took the break and since I came back,” said Barty, who also reached the doubles semifinals at the Hard Rock Stadium with Victoria Azarenka. “It’s been a few years now, but I certainly feel like I’m a very different person. I feel like I’m a more complete player, I’m a better player. I was an average cricketer and I’m becoming a better tennis player. I feel like when I play my best, I’m good enough to match it with the very best in the world.” Barty hit 15 aces and 41 winners compared to 22 from Pliskova.  Barty’s victory means that for the first time ever there have been 14 different winners in 14 WTA events so far this season. Struggle Pliskova, who will rise to fourth in the rankings despite a disappointing final, badly struggled with her serve and movement.

Music streaming providers like what they hear as listeners tune in|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Music lovers in India are spoilt for choice with various music streaming applications flooding the market. The segment has come under the spotlight following the entry of two international giants — Spotify and YouTube Music — within a span of a month. They will compete with homegrown players such as Wynk, Gaana and JioSaavn, besides international rivals Apple Music and Amazon Music. Driven by cheap data India is the next big market for music streaming, driven by factors such as increasing smartphone penetration and low data prices, plus the fact that a large part of the population accesses Internet via mobile phones. “Streaming has been around for a long time but it was constrained by consumers thinking very hard about how much it was going to cost them, because data charges were so high. In the last two years or so, data prices have dropped almost 90%, so the industry is really coming into its own,” Jehil Thakkar, partner at Deloitte India, said. A recent report by Deloitte and the Indian Music Industry (IMI) pointed out that the launch of Reliance Jio acted as a ‘powerful catalyst’, leading to a dramatic shift in not only the economics of the Indian telecom industry, but also in the quantum of Internet and data usage in the country. The overall number of music streaming users in India was estimated to be nearly 150 million in December 2018. “India is a music loving society with consumers spending 21.5 hours every week listening to music, against the global average of 17.8 hours. Helping satisfy this love for music is the audio OTT industry which is at an inflection point today,” Blaise Fernandes, president and CEO, IMI said. Echoing similar views, Sameer Batra, CEO — Content and Apps at Bharti Airtel, which runs Wynk Music, said, “For a category like music, you and I can be different in terms of what we like listening to, but love for music is fairly ubiquitous. So, there is significant market opportunity out there, which is essentially equal to the number of Internet users on mobiles.” He pointed out that India has about 400-450 million “serious Internet users… contrast this with the backdrop that the country doesn’t have too much broadband…What I see is an opportunity that doesn’t exist in any part of the world, which is why everybody is trying to get into the India market.” ‘Still at nascent stage’ Stating that these are still very early days for this sector, Mr. Thakkar said, “I think we are in year one of a 10-year journey. We are only just about starting to see large-scale adoption of these applications.”  He said that intense competition was natural for an industry in its early stages, and added that a lot of these apps were working on bringing out originals to woo consumers. However, Wynk Music is not very kicked up about “exclusive stuff”. “Some of our competitors have been trying to do exclusives. We don’t think that is the right way to go. We want to do more on the personalisation side rather than trying to buy exclusive content… Nobody knows what will work. What you may think is super hit, may be a dud for me and vice-versa. So, the success of following an exclusive strategy is right now questionable in the Indian context. It is now that the habit is building, so you can’t take very bold and long term bets on exclusivity,” Mr. Batra said. “The reality is that unlike video, where there is a lot of original content, music supply is pretty much similar… there are only so many songs in movies, etc… The key in terms of unlocking engagement is really about saying within the larger universe of say, 6-7 million songs that exists with everybody, who can customise and personalise the hell out of it.” ‘Potential to transform’ Amazon Prime, on the other hand, is betting on voice-command based features to pursue customers. “Music streaming is entering a new era…We believe voice has the potential to transform music listening,” Sahas Malhotra, director, Amazon Music – India, said. He pointed out that Amazon Music had integrated voice-based assistant Alexa into its mobile application. “We are so focussed on voice not because it is new or it is the cool thing. We believe voice removes barriers for people who otherwise find visual apps challenging, or to simply cut the time taken for people to get to their favourite song.” He added, “Our North Star is that Alexa becomes your music buddy. You should be able to think of it as a friend who will recommend stuff for you, play stuff for you depending on the mood you are in, or help you discover new music.”  The Deloitte-IMI report pointed out that while Bollywood had ruled the recorded music industry for decades, in the past couple of years, demand for more regional language content had risen. In 2016, Hindi film music contributed to 70% of consumption on streaming services such as Gaana and JioSaavn. However, about two years later, this figure has dropped to 50%, according to the report. It added that consumption of regional music during the time has grown from 5% to 25%. “More penetration to tier 2 and tier 3 cities has led to this shift.” Mr. Batra agreed. “As penetration of music services goes deeper into the country beyond people in large cities with multiple phones, who have exposure to forms of entertainment… the whole notion of regional content and role of regionalisation and stuff in the mother language of the users starts to play a big role. We are already seeing some massive trends in terms of regional non-filmy content.” “We are able to see that if you get customers to listen to regional songs in their mother language, then you are able to lock customers to servers in a meaningful way,” he added. Mr. Malhotra pointed out that India was the first market where the company saw people consuming music in multiple languages. Monetisation Presently, of the various digital music revenue modes in India, 60% revenue comes from streaming. While paid subscribers provide a stable source of revenue, unfortunately, in India, less than 1% of the subscribers are paid users and nearly 14% are bundled users, as per the report, and the remaining 85% are on free subscription. “This implies 15% of subscribers contribute to 55% of streaming revenues, whereas 85% of subscribers contribute to the remaining 45% of streaming revenues [i.e. ad-supported streaming revenues]”. As per the report, currently, the cost of a 10-second advertisement on music streaming apps ranges between Rs. 150 and Rs. 250 CPM (cost per thousand impressions). “Therefore, to inculcate the habit of paying for music among consumers, it is critical that audio OTT platforms actively try and convert free users and bundled users to paid subscriptions.” Currently, bundled users pay for music streaming services as part of the data pack charges levied by the telecom service provider. Mr. Batra said “We have decent scale on it. I won’t say outstanding scale, but the real answer is that right now habit formation is happening. I don’t think there is anybody at a meaningful scale at the moment. But I think that time will come.” While green shoots can be seen, monetisation will be a long-haul contest in India, he opined. “Early signs of monetisation are still there. It’s not a bleak picture. Are you at a place where cost of investment vs monetisation are evening out, there is some time…as you get deep into the country, we believe monetisation will emerge. The top-end of the pyramid is already paying for content.” Stating that real differentiation between the companies will be the content, the user interface and the pricing, Mr. Thakkar added that “general category” streaming services will need deep pockets to stay in the game because monetisation today is challenging. “So, you will have to continue to spend on content, new features in your apps without commensurate returns for the medium term. It is almost imperative for you to be a deep-pocketed player.”  Hindi film music’s share in these apps has fallen from 70% in 2016 to 50% now; regional music’s has risen

Interesting face-off between two teams on a high|MOHALI|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|A day’s break between two high-intensity games may not be enough for players to recover but both Kings XI Punjab and Delhi Capitals would be hoping their respective morale-boosting victories — in contrasting fashion — on Saturday would give the required momentum when they face off here on Monday. Delhi, which registered its second win of the season, travels for its first away game here, high on Prithvi Shaw and Shreyas Iyer’s brilliant batting and the Super Over heroics of Kagiso Rabada. KXIP was more than relieved to finally see K.L. Rahul get back among runs, with some help from wayward MI bowling. Both would want their respective youngsters to continue leading the charge. No practice With the teams opting out of practice on the eve of the game the focus would be on execution on a pitch that, on Saturday, had something for both batsmen and bowlers but required patience and commitment. There are concerns for both sides. KXIP managed to restrict Mumbai to an under-par score but, barring skipper R. Ashwin and his leg-spinning namesake, gave away quite a few loose deliveries. Against the Delhi batting of Rishabh Pant, Shreyas, Shaw and Shikhar Dhawan, they could be disastrous for the team. The team has had handy contributions from its middle order but would hope for a lot more consistency – barring Mayank Agarwal and Chris Gayle, no other player has managed to score enough in all three games so far. Giving away too many runs is an area Delhi would also be wary of. Shaw and Shreyas’ batting helped overshadow the poor performance with the ball through the game even though Rabada redeemed himself in the Super Over. That the team was unable to cross the finish line in regulation time would also not make the skipper happy and Delhi would not want another semi-choke at the end even as Punjab hopes to take advantage of familiar conditions to continue defending its fortress.

Rajwinder spins Pistons to innings win|Chennai:|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Left-arm spinner Rajwinder Singh’s five for 23 helped India Pistons script an innings and 37-run win over CromBest on the second day of the TNCA first division league on Sunday. Resuming at 134 for four, chasing CromBest’s 148, Pistons made 264 and went on to skittle out the former for 79. R.

Bjerregaard gets the better of Tiger|Washington|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Tiger Woods won a dramatic morning showdown with Rory McIlroy only to be upset by Denmark’s Lucas Bjerregaard in Saturday’s quarterfinals of the WGC Match Play golf Championship. Woods, seeking a fourth WGC Match Play title, defeated McIlroy 2&1 in a morning knockout match only to fall 1-up to the 50th-seeded Dane, dropping the 18th hole when he missed a four-foot par putt. “We read it inside left centre and it went left,” Woods said. “It was just one of those weird spots. It’s match play. They are going to put the pins in difficult spots and we just have to make the shots.” To meet Kuchar Bjerregaard, who will face 23rd seed Matt Kuchar of USA in the semifinals, marvelled at his achievement and the crowds Woods drew. “We had a great match. It’s a shame it had to end like this,” Bjerregaard said. “I enjoyed playing with him. It was a cool experience. To say I’ve beaten Tiger, it’s right up there.” “It’s so different to what I’ve ever experienced before. I’ve never heard so many yells, his name all the way around. It was really enjoyable but it must be hard to do that every day.” “His ball flight was low and in these conditions that was advantageous,” Woods said. Molinari vs Kisner Italy’s Francesco Molinari, the highest remaining seed at seventh, will meet 48th seed Kevin Kisner, last year’s runner-up to Bubba Watson, in the other semifinal to set up an 18-hole afternoon championship final. The results:  Quarterfinals: Kevin Kisner bt Louis Oosthuizen 2&1; Francesco Molinari bt Kevin Na 6&5; Lucas Bjerregaard bt Tiger Woods 1-up; Matt Kuchar bt Sergio Garcia 2-up. Round of 16: Woods bt Rory McIlroy 2&1; Bjerregaard bt Henrik Stenson 3&2; Kuchar bt Tyrrell Hatton 4&3; Garcia bt Branden Grace 1-up; Oosthuizen bt Marc Leishman 2&1; Kisner bt Li Haotong 6&5; Molinari bt Paul Casey 5&4; Kevin Na bt Justin Rose 2-up.  To say I’ve beaten Tiger, it’s right up there. It’s so different to what I’ve ever experienced before. I’ve never heard so many yells, his name all the way around.— Bjerregaard

BCCI clears air over Pant’s chatter|New Delhi|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Wicketkeeper-batsman Rishabh Pant was on Sunday caught in the eye of a storm owing to an edited stump microphone clip from an IPL game which went viral on social media but was dismissed by the BCCI as “misconstrued”. The clip was from Saturday’s match between Capitals and Knight Riders. It shows Pant, from behind the stumps, saying “yeh to chauka hai” (this is a boundary) as KKR’s Robin Uthappa took guard against Sandeep Lamichhane. “No one heard what Rishabh said before that particular sentence. He was apparently telling (Delhi Capitals captain) Shreyas Iyer to increase fielders on the off-side to stop an imminent four,” a top BCCI official toldPTI. The next delivery was pushed through the covers for a boundary and the edited clip of Pant’s purported prediction started doing the rounds. The BCCI official said that it was “very unfortunate” that social media ran an incomplete clipping.

Imperious Sunrisers Hyderabad steamroller hapless Royal Challengers Bangalore|HYDERABAD|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|It was a no-show from the Virat Kohli-led Royal Challengers Bangalore! First, Jonny Bairstow and David Warner slammed superb centuries and then the wily Afghan off-spinner Mohammad Nabi bowled a dream spell of four for 11 to fashion a thumping 118-run win for Sunrisers Hyderabad at the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium here on Sunday. This was RCB’s third straight loss and SRH’s second win in three games. Losing the script Chasing an imposing target of 232, RCB lost the script early thanks to Nabi’s superb variations of pace, flight and spin. The way he beguiled Shimron Hetmyer, to be stumped by Bairstow, and then cleaned up A.B. de Villiers with a slower one that induced a poor stroke, were a sight to watch. To compound the misery, Kohli was tempted by a delivery that was bowled marginally wide of the off-stump by pacer Sandeep Sharma and the cover drive played away from the body was taken by Warner. That effectively shut RCB out of the match and the rest was a mere formality.  And when Nabi finished his impressive spell, which included 16 dot balls and just one four, RCB had been reduced to 38 for six in eight overs. Later pacer Sandeep Sharma ended with a three-wicket haul. Earlier, when Sunrisers were put in to bat, Bairstow and Warner were at their imperious best. Bowlers across all teams might not be faulted if they start wondering whether the one-year ban has made Warner more dangerous, given the way he has played in the first three games. Record-breaking stand Bairstow and Warner batted with great freedom to become the first opening pair to post three consecutive century stands in IPL history and the partnership of 185 (98 balls) bettered the previous record of 184 set by Gautam Gambhir and Chris Lynn for Kolkata Knight Riders against Gujarat Lions in 2017. It was not just the stroke-play of the duo but the wonderful judgement, in converting singles into twos, that never really let the attack settle down. The celebrations by the two centurions (only the second instance of two batsmen scoring tons in the same innings in IPL after Kohli and de Villiers did so against Gujarat Lions in 2016) was a reflection of the intensity with which they batted. Prayas Ray Barman, at 16 years and 157 days, becomes the youngest IPL debutant, beating Afghanistan’s Mujeeb Ur Rehman (17 years, 11 days) Prayas Ray Barman, at 16 years and 157 days, becomes the youngest IPL debutant, beating Afghanistan’s Mujeeb Ur Rehman (17 years, 11 days)

Oops, there goes the lid!|GURUGRAM|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Stephen Gallacher did raise the winner’s trophy but could not pose with it for too long. Posing for the photographers, Gallacher moved far too close to the water-body adjacent to the 18th green. His action saw the lid of the trophy fall into the water. With the lid not immediately retrievable, he was presented the replica of the trophy. Though some photographers were lucky to click the champion with the original trophy, others had to make do with the winner holding the replica. The trophy presented to the winner since 1964 has the names of the champions inscribed on a chrome plate and the champion is given a replica for keeps. In fact, Gallacher came to the media-conference holding the replica. Later, a diver fetched the lid.

Olympic qualifiers first challenge for Reid: Gomes|Mumbai|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Hockey Olympian Marcellus Gomes sees the qualifiers for the 2020 Tokyo Games as the first major challenge for new national men’s coach Graham Reid. Reid, an Australian, is set to take over as the coach of the senior men’s team following the exit of Harendra Singh from the post after the last World Cup in Bhubaneshwar. “The most important thing for him is to ensure that the team qualifies (for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics) and the qualifying round is important,” he said the former inside right after the inauguration of a synthetic hockey turf at the Don Bosco School in Matunga here. His former Mahindra colleague and ex-India skipper M.M. Somaya felt that with Reid set to take charge, the Australian style of play could come into effect which would help the national team. “Graham Reid is an experienced coach and he will probably get some of the Australian style of play and that (could be) beneficial,” said Somaya.

Capitals stop a fighting Knight Riders in Super Over|NEW DELHI|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Once Prithvi Shaw stood tall, by comparison, even Andre Russell’s mighty contribution was dwarfed. But all that was pushed into the background once Delhi Capitals faltered in the final over of its chase of Kolkata Knight Riders’ 185 and left the match tied. In the Super Over bowled by Prasidh Krishna, Delhi scored 10 for the loss of Shreyas Iyer’s wicket. In its hunt, Kolkata lost Russell to Kagiso Rabada off the third ball and could only score seven. Delhi’s second win of the season, also resulted in Kolkata’s first loss in three outings. Dramatic turn Shaw — 99 with three sixes and 12 boundaries — took Delhi to the threshold of victory before the script took a dramatic turn. Needing six runs off Kuldeep Yadav’s over, Delhi managed just five and lost wickets off the last two deliveries. Though Kolkata lost, it displayed great grit to make a match of it after being reduced to 61 for five in the 10th over. Russell took the fight to the Capitals’ camp with a 28-ball 62, dotted with six sixes and four boundaries. In comparison, Dinesh Karthik’s 36-ball 50 wore a look of sanity. Speaking later Russel said, “It was tough for me after getting hit on the shoulder (off Harshal Patel). Karthik helps Russell “Karthik kept talking to me throughout the innings. I told DK that I was getting the pain, so there was no point of hanging there, I played my shots. It worked for me. At one point we were thinking of 150 but the partnership between me and DK helped us post 185.” But the hero of the evening was Shaw, although he was unlucky to miss his maiden century in the Indian Premier League when his miscued skier was pouched by Karthik. Till Shaw opened up to play some punishing strokes, the visiting team was confident of defending its hard-earned 185 for eight in 20 overs.  The early loss of Shikhar Dhawan did not hurt Delhi as skipper Shreyas joined his Mumbai Ranji teammate and set the pace for the chase. The two added 89 runs off 56 deliveries to offset Kolkata’s innings-resurrecting stand of 95 off 53 between Russell and skipper Dinesh Karthik.  Andre Russell

NASA’s Mars helicopter completes flight tests|Washington|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|NASA’s Mars Helicopter, designed to fly in thin atmosphere and low gravity, has successfully completed flight tests and is prepared for its journey to the Red Planet scheduled to take off in 2020, the U.S. space agency said. Weighing in at no more than 1.8 kg, the helicopter is a technology demonstration project currently going through the rigorous verification process certifying it for Mars. The helicopter has to function in extremely cold temperatures, including nights with temperatures as low as minus 90 degrees Celsius. The helicopter is scheduled to reach the surface of the Red Planet in February 2021.

Picasso in Ivory Coast? A village tells of its brush with the artist|FAKAHA|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|“I’m sure! I tell you, he came. I saw him!” insists Soro Navaghi, keen to extinguish any doubts about Pablo Picasso’s visit to a small Ivorian village famed for its painted textiles. Whether in tourist brochures or online, it is not unusual to find references to Picasso’s reputed visit to Fakaha, a remote village in northern Ivory Coast, some 650 km from Abidjan, the economic capital. French travel guide Petit Fute describes Fakaha as “internationally renowned” for its hand-spun cotton cloth, which is painted by the Senufo people and that once “charmed a certain Picasso as he paid a discreet visit to the region at the turn of the century.” A whole mythology has grown up around the question of Africa and Picasso, who never spoke of having been to Fakaha. For the artist who once brushed off the subject, saying: “Negro art? Don’t know it”, was also an ardent admirer and passionate collector of African art. Highlighting the resemblance between African sculpture and some of Picasso’s work, many art critics see the symbolism and imagery of Africa as one of his sources of inspiration. One often-cited example is the similarity between an African Grebo mask and one of the faces in his 1907 workLes Demoiselles d’Avignon. “Whenever someone emphasised the influence of African art on the development of his own work, he would shrug his shoulders, annoyed at being reduced to that: although it is certain he was influenced by it from 1906 when he experienced his first (African) sculptures,” says Gilles Plazy, one of his biographers. “Picasso used everything that came through his door and integrated it into the constant evolution of his artistic process,” he said. “He opened up new paths.” Out of the bush, barefoot For decades, local artists have been hard at work in open huts around a sandy track, where they can be found smearing earth-based pigments onto canvas. Their dexterity is fascinating, their moves precise. Working with knives or sticks, they plunge their tools into the bowls of colour, quickly transforming the white cotton into a work of art covered with animal motifs and figures in masks. And there is an element of Picasso in it, with a definite similarity between his works and those of the artists of Fakaha. But is this just a random resemblance or creative coincidence? Or did Pablo Picasso actually see or even own one of the Fakaha canvases? “I tell you, he came here. He was inspired by us,” repeats Soro Navaghi. If there is no trace of Picasso’s visit, it is because he wanted it to be kept secret and not give away the fact that he had been inspired by Fakaha, a villager says. If he did make the journey, Picasso would have had to take a boat to Abidjan, then travel the remaining 1,000 km by road in scorching, dry conditions with little shade from the sun -- an adventure more suited to an explorer. Such an epic trip would have taken at least several months, and would likely have featured in one of his biographies. Even so, the story retains an element of mysterious intrigue.

FB chief calls for ‘more active’ govt. role in Internet regulation|Washington|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg called on Saturday for governments to play a “more active role” in regulating the internet, urging more countries to adopt versions of European rules aimed at safeguarding user privacy. Facebook and other internet giants have long resisted government intervention, but the leading social network has reversed its course amid growing calls for regulation, in an apparent bid to help steer the debate. “I believe we need a more active role for governments and regulators,” he wrote in an op-ed published inThe Washington Post. “By updating the rules for the internet, we can preserve what’s best about it — the freedom for people to express themselves and for entrepreneurs to build new things — while also protecting society from broader harms,” he said. Mr. Zuckerberg argues that regulations are needed in four areas: harmful content, protection of elections, privacy and data portability. Facebook has drawn fire over all four, from hate speech on the platform and the recent live streaming of attacks on mosques in New Zealand, to its use in foreign efforts to meddle in elections and concerns over its collection of personal user data. On user privacy, Mr. Zuckerberg said that he would support more countries adopting rules in line with the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, which gives regulators sweeping powers to sanction organisations that fail to adhere to standards of security when processing personal data. “I believe it would be good for the internet if more countries adopted regulation such as GDPR as a common framework,” he wrote, also calling for regulation to guarantee data portability between services. On harmful content, he said that “third-party bodies” could set standards on distribution of harmful material and “measure companies against those standards.”

Self-driving cars learn to navigate the unknown|Boston|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Stanford scientists have developed a way for self-driving cars that to learn from previous experiences, helping the autonomous vehicles perform more safely in extreme and unknown circumstances. The researchers tested the technology on a racetrack using two self-driving cars Niki and Shelley. Making cars safe The system performed about as well as an existing autonomous control system and an experienced driver, they said. “Our work is motivated by safety, and we want autonomous vehicles to work in many scenarios, from normal driving on high-friction asphalt to fast, low-friction driving in ice and snow,” said Nathan Spielberg, a graduate student at Stanford University in the U.S. “We want our algorithms to be as good as the best skilled drivers — and, hopefully, better,” said Mr. Spielberg. While current autonomous cars might rely on in-the-moment evaluations of their environment, the control system these researchers designed incorporates data from recent manoeuvres and past driving experiences — including trips Niki took around an icy test track near the Arctic Circle. Its ability to learn from the past could prove particularly powerful, given the abundance of autonomous car data researchers are producing in the process of developing these vehicles. Control systems for autonomous cars need access to information about the available road-tire friction. This information dictates the limits of how hard the car can brake, accelerate and steer in order to stay on the road in critical emergency scenarios. Neural network If engineers want to safely push an autonomous car to its limits, such as having it plan an emergency manoeuvre on ice, they have to provide it with details, like the road-tire friction, in advance. This is difficult in the real world where friction is variable and often is difficult to predict. To develop a more flexible, responsive control system, the researchers built a neural network — a type of artificially intelligent computing system — that integrates data from past driving experiences, and a winter test facility with foundational knowledge provided by 2,00,000 physics-based trajectories.

Thai rangers rescue 6 baby elephants|Bangkok|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Six baby elephants separated from their parents and trapped in a muddy pit for days have been rescued by park rangers in rural Thailand. Patrolling rangers chanced upon the struggling herd in a national park east of Bangkok. Once they realised the calves, aged between one and four years old, could not climb out of the watering hole, they took up rescue effort. After three hours of digging to build a makeshift ramp, the babies managed to come out of the pit one-by-one as the rangers cheered them on.

Importance of raja vidya|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|In chapter nine of the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna tells Arjuna about bhakti yoga. The Lord calls it raja vidya. It is the king among vidyas, and hence the name. But in that case, it should be vidya raja. Why is it called raja vidya? The central incisors are referred to as rajadanta, because they are considered the most important teeth. Vedanta Desika points to this Sanskrit usage. This usage clearly shows that saying raja vidya is correct, explained V.S. Karunakarachariar, in a discourse. However, the word raja should not be interpreted in the narrow sense of referring to a ruler. That would limit this vidya only to kings. The word raja is used to indicate that this is a vidya for anyone with thoughts of a higher order. Anyone not preoccupied with mundane things, who wants to keep his mind on a higher plane automatically becomes a fit person to receive knowledge about this vidya. The Bhagavad Gita can be difficult to understand, and to simplify it for us, Alavandar summarised its salient points in his Gitartha Sangraha. Ramanujacharya, of course, wrote a bhashya (commentary) for the Gita. Vedanta Desika wrote the Tatparya Chandrika, explaining the Bhagavad Gita. The Bhagavad Gita begins with Arjuna’s confused state of mind. He tells Krishna to drive the chariot and place it between the two opposing armies, so that he (Arjuna) can look round and see the people he has to fight. Seeing on the opposite side the elders of his family, his teachers and kith and kin, Arjuna says he will not fight. How can he kill his own people, he wonders. Krishna then tells him that he will not be killing them, because the atma cannot be killed. But why is an entire chapter devoted just to Arjuna’s doubts? The reason is because doubts constitute the starting point of acquiring knowledge.

It’s story time, folks|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|This week, we start with a familiar story. You know the story ofThe Monkey and The Crocodile, right? If you don’t, here it is. Read on! A monkey lived among the branches of a large jamun (java plum) tree. Perhaps because the tree was on the banks of a clear river, the jamuns from the tree were large and very very sweet. Below the tree, swimming in the river was a huge crocodile that had a wife on a mud bank down the river. One day, the crocodile swam ashore and rested under the jamun tree. The kind-hearted monkey plucked some jamuns and dropped them below. Not surprisingly, the crocodile came back the next day and was offered jamuns by the monkey. Through this exchange of jamun fruits, a strange friendship grew between the monkey and the crocodile. One day the crocodile carried some luscious jamuns to his wife. She loved the fruits and said, “Dear, the fruits are so juicy and sweet! And the monkey eats them every day! Just imagine how sweet his heart will be! If you love me, you have to do this. Get me the heart of the monkey.” The crocodile was shocked. How could he kill the monkey, his friend? His wife gave him an idea. That evening, the crocodile invited the monkey to dinner. “My wife wants to thank you for the jamuns you sent her,” he said. The monkey was happy but couldn’t swim, so the crocodile took him on his back. Half way down the river, thinking it was safe to talk about it, the crocodile blurted out the real reason for taking the monkey home. Thinking quickly, the monkey said, “You should have told me earlier, I left my heart on the tree. We must go back and get it.” The crocodile took him back to the tree. The monkey was saved. This is a story from the Panchatantra – meaning the Five Strategies.

Islands of interest|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Abhi:Sid, I was reading about New Zealand, as it was in the news recently. And I came to know that New Zealand's two main islands (the North Island and the South Island) didn't have official names until 2013. They were named after a public consultation by the New Zealand Geographic Board. Sid:Oh really! Talking of names, recently I came to know about the Islands of Disappointment, in Pacific islands in French Polynesia, in the South Pacific Ocean. Abhi(Laughs out loud): What a funny name! Sid:Yes, it was named by an English explorer called Lord Byron in 1765 as his attempt to set foot on the ‘beautiful’ island failed. Byron and his sailing crew were threatened by the natives, who showed up on the beach brandishing long spears, when they tried to enter. Let down, Byron sailed away and named the place the ‘Islands of Disappointment’. Abhi:Interesting! Actually, there are many islands with more bizarre names. Sid:Like…? Abhi:Goodenough Island in the Solomon Sea, Ios, a Greek Island, Mafia Island in Tanzania and Mistaken Island near West Australia are just some of them. Sid:Curious to know the stories behind each of these names. Abhi:Yes, me too. Have to read about them. An island located in the Thousand Islands chain in the United States is called Just Room Enough Island, where there is just enough room for a house and a tree. The island was bought in the 1950s by a wealthy family, who wanted a holiday getaway and built a house there. Sid:Have you heard of La Gomera, one of Spain's Canary Islands, located in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Africa? Abhi:Oh, yes! The inhabitants of La Gomera use ‘whistle’ language to communicate with one another. Am I right? Sid:Yes. They call the language ‘Silbo Gomero’, using which they can communicate with people 5 km away. Abhi:Okay Sid, we are getting late for the movie. Shall we start? Sid:Sure, talking of movie, I am reminded of this ‘buffalo’ island. Abhi:What? Sid:Well, that’s not the name of the island. The name is Catalina Island in California. If you visit the place, you will be welcomed by herds of buffaloes. A herd of non-native buffalo was brought to the island in 1924 for shooting a silent film. After the shoot, the crew left the island leaving the buffaloes behind. After nearly a century, the buffalo population has grown to more than 150. Abhi: Holy cow!

When Luna 10 went around the moon|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Have you ever stared at the Moon, wondering about the mysteries and secrets that it possesses? Being a natural satellite of the Earth, the Moon has fascinated humankind from timeimmemorial. While we still continue to learn more and more about it, knowledge about it increased by leaps and bounds during the second half of the 20th century. This period included the Space Age when the Soviet Union and the U.S. were involved in a tug of war to find out who will land the first humans in space. The Americans did manage to edge out in the end, with their famed Apollo 11 spaceflight that landed the first two people on the Moon. The Soviets, however, did enjoy a number of successes before it, including the first spacecraft that successfully orbited our Moon. About Luna 10 Following a string of achievements with their Luna missions, the Soviets turned their attention towards a spacecraft that would become the first to orbit the Moon. The Luna 10 mission was designated a Ye-6S spacecraft, with a fuelled mass of around 1,350 kg attached to a 245 kg lunar orbiter module, which was 1.5 m tall and 75 cm in diameter at the base. The payload included seven instruments: a gamma-ray spectrometer, a triaxial magnetometer, a piezoelectric micrometeoroid detector, gas discharge counters, measuring devices for infrared emissions from the Moon, low energy X-ray detectors, and a bank of charged particle detectors. It additionally comprised a radio system that was to be employed for gravitational and radiooccultationstudies. First attempt fails The first attempt of the mission, scheduled for March 1, 1966, failed as it never left the Earth orbit. Following this failure, the second and backup Ye-6s probe was hastily prepared. Launched on March 31, 1966, it turned out to be successful. After being injected into an Earth orbit, Luna 10 was launched towards the Moon from its Earth-orbiting platform. It did require a mid-course correction on April 1, but by April 3 Luna 10 entered orbit around the Moon. When the lunar orbiter module separated and started going around the Moon, it became the first human-made object to orbit any astronomical body other than the Earth. Over 200 data transmissions Apart from its firsts, Luna 10 also provided valuable information about the Moon based on observations through the equipment it carried. It was able to tell that magnetic field around the Moon was either weak or non-existent and also that the Moon doesn’t possess anydiscernibleatmosphere (we now know that the Moon has a very, very thin layer of gases). In all, the Luna 10 operated as an artificial satellite of our natural satellite for 56 days, completing 460 lunar orbits during that time and providing over 200 data transmissions. When its batteries started dying out and signals were discontinued on May 30, 1966, it was still in an orbit around our Moon.  A lie that stood for decades The launch of the Luna 10 was timed such that it would be orbiting the Moon for the first time when the 23rd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union convened. In order to make a political show of it, Luna 10 carried a set of solid-state oscillators programmed to reproduce the notes ofThe Internationale, the anthem of the Soviet Union. On the morning of April 4, 1966,The Internationalewas played over loudspeakers to the 5,000 delegates who had assembled, claimed to be broadcast live from Luna 10 as it went around the Moon. This claim, however, was revealed to be a lie nearly 30 years later. While the playback went perfectly well during a rehearsal on the night of April 3, the controllers discovered a missing note in a session during the morning of April 4. In order to avoid any embarrassment, they played a recording from the previous night, claiming it to be live. Therefore, while the broadcast was from Luna 10 as it orbited the Moon, it wasn’t in fact live, but only a recording.

Students’ climate strike goes global|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Climate change is already a reality. Heat waves, floods, and hurricanes are killing hundreds and devastating communities across the world. The impact of climate change on the future generation could be even more catastrophic. But what are governments doing about it? Not enough. At least that is the view of thousands of students, from various parts of the world, who have been skipping school to take part in strikes as part of the Fridays For Future movement. Let’s find out more about the global demonstration in this week’s Five Ws and One H.  Simply put, Fridays for Future (also called Youth for Climate and Youth Strike 4 Climate) is a coming together of school students to tackle the issue of climate change. Since August 2018, there have been widespread and frequent strikes. Students have been demanding that governments cut greenhouse gas emissions and frame stronger environmental laws to fight climate change and secure their future.  This wave of youth activism began with 16-year-old Greta Thunberg from Sweden, who began camping outside the Swedish Parliament in August 2018 urging lawmakers to uphold their commitment to fight climate change as agreed to under the Paris climate accord. She continued her sit-in for three weeks. By September, Thunberg decided to protest every Friday, leading to the hashtag #FridaysforFuture. She took to social media posting about her protests and climate change. Her posts went viral and inspired students from across the globe to follow suit. Since 2019, the Fridays for Future movement has grown in strength with more and more students from the United Kingdom, Australia, France, Germany, Ireland, Uganda, Thailand, Colombia, and Poland skipping school to protest outside their respective parliaments and town halls.  Greta Thunberg comes from a family of artistes - her mother is a singer, father an actor and grandfather an actor-director in Sweden. She is a vegan and has given up flying because of the climate effects caused by aviation. In 2018, she said she had been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome (a development disorder characterised by difficulty in social interaction). Since her Fridays for Future movement, she has been recognised as a climate activist. In December 2018, she was invited to address the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Poland and later the World Economic Forum in Davos in January 2019, where she took the world by surprise when she criticised the world leaders, by telling them they were to blame for the worsening climate crisis. In December 2018,Timemagazine named Thunberg as one of the world's 25 most influential teenagers of 2018. In recognition of her efforts, Greta Thunberg has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, by three Norwegian lawmakers.  The strikers around the world have different demands, but the common call is that they want their governments to aggressively cut greenhouse gas emissions. Some strikers also want the voting age to be lowered so that they can have a greater say in the political process. In the U.K., the students demand that the government declare a climate emergency and prioritise the protection of life on Earth, taking active steps to achieve climate justice.  On March 15, students from 123 countries took part in the protest. In India, students from Bengaluru, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Gurugram, Bhavnagar in Gujarat, Ambikapur in Chhattisgarh, and Udaipur in Rajasthan to villages in Bihar came together to voice their demands.  Policymakers and leaders have been critical of students’ activism. Prime Minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom criticised the strikes as wasting teaching time. Australian Education Minister said that the students must not skip classes and should hold protests outside the school hours. But a few Dutch scientists have come in support of the school strikes in the Netherlands. In Germany, a group of more than 23, 000 scientists founded Scientists for Future (S4F) in support of the factual correctness of the claims formulated by the movement.

#Follow him?|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Think social media and one of the top names that come into one’s mind is Twitter. Where people used to voice their views in several endless words, Twitter helped them do it in 140 characters. Today, it is one of the most popular social networking sites on the Internet. But do you know the person who co-founded this social media company?  Evan Clark Williams is an American computer programmer and Internet entrepreneur. He is the co-founder of social networking platform Twitter, and the blog distribution website, Blogger. He is also the founder of blog hosting site Medium.  Born on March 31, 1972 in Clarks, Nebraska, the U.S., Williams is the third child of Laurie Howe and Monte Williams. He grew up in the family farm at Clarks, assisting with crop irrigation during summers. Williams attended the University of Nebraska–Lincoln but quit a year-and-a-half into the course to pursue a career, and with aspirations to start his own company. He later worked at various technology and start-up firms across the country, before returning to his family farm. He also briefly ran a company he set up with his father to provide instructional material about the World Wide Web. In 1996, Williams moved to Sebastopol, California to work for O'Reilly Media, a technology publishing company. Though he started work with them in a marketing position, he later became an independent contractor writing computer codes; a skill he learnt on his own. This skill helped him earn freelance opportunities with companies such as Intel and Hewlett-Packard. Meanwhile, he started his own website called EvHead.com, where he began blogging about his personal thoughts.  In 1999, Williams co-founded Pyra Labs with Meg Hourihan, blogger and author, to make project management software. A note-taking feature on their software soon spun off as Blogger, one of the first web applications for creating and managing weblogs. Williams was the one who coined and popularised the terms ‘blogger’ and ‘blog’. He was featured in the MIT Technology Review TR100 as one of the top 100 innovators in the world under the age of 35 in 2003. The same year, Pyra Labs was acquired by Google and Williams left Google in 2004 to co-found Odeo, a podcast company, with Noah Glass, a software developer. In 2005, Christopher Isaac "Biz" Stone, an entrepreneur, joined Odeo, and in 2006, along with Glass, Stone and Jack Dorsey, a computer programmer and entrepreneur, Williams founded the Obvious Corporation.  Obvious Corporation’s first project was Twitter – a free social networking and micro-blogging service. Twitter was launched in 2006, and became instantly popular. In 2007, Twitter was spun off as a new company with Williams as a co-founder. The following year, Williams became the CEO of Twitter and worked on the development of the company. In 2010, he stepped down from the position of CEO to focus on product strategy. He, however, continued to be on the Twitter’s Board till February 2019. Two years later, Williams founded Medium, an online publishing platform to let users express their views in more than the 140 characters that Twitter offered. He wished to improve the quality of content produced on publishing platforms and worked towards making Medium easy to use for people who have, in his own words “thoughtful things to say”. Though Medium was initially available only to early adopters, it was opened to public in 2013. Today, it is a popular blog hosting platform where people write and consume content on a variety of topics.  His determination to keep moving forward. Williams might have been a dropout, but he worked on his skills and started Blogger, a highly successful platform. However, the popularity of Blogger did not stop Williams from moving ahead and starting other digital platforms such as Twitter and Medium, used by millions across the world today.   Maybe it was because I grew up on that farm with so many ideas in my head and so few people to share them with that I couldn't think of anything more exciting than a system with the potential to connect brains from all over the planet.   - Evan Williams

Mars the wanderer|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Mars showsstargazersexactly what the term "planet" originally meant with its rapid movement across the evening sky this month. The ancient Greeks used the term planete, meaning wanderer, to label the bright star-like objects that travelled between the constellations of the zodiac year after year. You can watch Mars as it wanders through the sky throughout April, visible in the west for several hours after sunset. Mars travels past two of the most famous star clusters in our night sky: the Pleiades and Hyades. Look for the red planet next to the tiny but bright Pleiades on April 1. By the second week in April, it has moved eastward in Taurus towards the larger V-shaped Hyades. Red Mars appears to the right of the slightly brighter red-orange star Aldebaran on April 11. We see only the brightest stars in these clusters with our unaided eyes; how many additional stars can you observe through binoculars? A closer Mars Open clusters are made up of young stars born from the same "star nursery" of gas and dust. These two open clusters are roughly similar in size. The Pleiades appears much smaller as they are 444 light years away, roughly 3 times the distance of the Hyades, at 151 light years distant. Aldebaran is in the same line of sight as the Hyades, but is actually not a member of the cluster; it actually shines just 65light yearsaway! By comparison, Mars is practically next door to us, this month just a mere 18 light minutes from Earth - that’s about almost 200 million miles. Think of the difference between how long it takes the light to travel from these bodies: 18 minutes vs. 65 years! Before dawn The rest of the bright planets rise before dawn, in a loose lineup starting from just above the eastern horizon to high above the south: Mercury, Venus, Saturn, and Jupiter. Watch this month as the apparent gap widens considerably between the gas giants and terrestrial planets. Mercury hugs the horizon all month, with Venus racing down morning after morning to join its dimmer inner solar system companion right before sunrise. In contrast, the giants Jupiter and Saturn move away from the horizon and rise earlier all month long, with Jupiter rising before midnight by the end of April. The Lyrids meteor shower peaks on April 22 , but sadly all but the brightest meteors will be washed out by the light of a brightgibbousMoon.

13 lakh rupees to lie in bed for 60 days?|Berlin|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|A new project offers to pay volunteers nearly 13 lakh rupees to lie in bed for 60 days to help scientists study how weightlessness affects the human body, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) said. Effective countermeasures against bone and muscle atrophy must be developed if astronauts are to live for long periods of time in space or on the Moon and Mars. DLR, in collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA, has launched the Artificial Gravity Bed Rest Study. The study will investigate the use of artificial gravity as a possible means of preventing the negative effects of weightlessness on the human body, DLR said in a statement. During the three-month study, two thirds of the test participants will be ‘rotated’ each day while lying in the DLR short-arm centrifuge in the :envihab aerospace medical research facility. According to a report in CNN, the study participants will be paid 16,500 euros or nearly 13 lakh rupees. The 12 female and 12 male volunteers will spend 60 days in the beds, according to DLR. They will remain there for 89 days, including the pre-test and recovery phases. All experiments, meals, and leisure pursuits will take place lying down during the bed-rest phase. The beds are angled downwards towards the head end by six degrees. This will simulate the displacement of bodily fluids experienced by astronauts in a microgravity environment. “Both effects are similar to what astronauts experience in space,” said Leticia Vega, Associate Chief Scientist for International Collaborations for NASA’s Human Research Program.

Navigating in extreme conditions|Boston|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Stanford scientists have developed a way for self-driving cars that learn from previous experiences, helping the autonomous vehicles perform more safely in extreme and unknown circumstances. The researchers tested the technology on a racetrack using two self-driving cars Niki and Shelley. The system performed about as well as an existing autonomous control system and an experienced race car driver, they said. “Our work is motivated by safety, and we want autonomous vehicles to work in many scenarios, from normal driving on high-friction asphalt to fast, low-friction driving in ice and snow,” said Nathan Spielberg, a graduate student at Stanford University in the US. “We want our algorithms to be as good as the best skilled drivers - and, hopefully, better,” said Spielberg. The results of this experiment was encouraging, but the researchers stress that their neural network system does not perform well in conditions outside the ones it has experienced. They say as autonomous cars generate additional data to train their network, the cars should be able to handle a wider range of conditions.PTI

A remarkable feat of cognition|Los Angeles|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Humans absorb about 1.5 megabytes of data from their birth to adulthood to learn their native language, scientists say. Learning one’s native language may seem effortless. However, the research from the University of California (UC) Berkeley in the US shows that language acquisition between birth and 18 is a remarkable feat of cognition, rather than something humans are just hardwired to do. Researchers calculated that, from infancy to young adulthood, learners absorb approximately 12.5 million bits of information about language - about two bits per minute - to fully acquire linguistic knowledge. If converted into binary code, the data would fill a 1.5 Mb floppy disk, the study found. The findings, published in the Royal Society Open Science journal, challenge assumptions that human language acquisition happens effortlessly, and that robots would have an easy time mastering it. “Ours is the first study to put a number on the amount you have to learn to acquire language,” said Steven Piantadosi, an assistant professor at UC Berkeley. “It highlights that children and teens are remarkable learners, absorbing upwards of 1,000 bits of information each day,” said Piantadosi.PTI

Stalagmite key to predicting droughts, floods for India: Study|Washington:|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST| An unusual cave in Meghalaya has helped unlock secrets about climate change, according to scientists who say that data from stalagmites in India could help better predict monsoon patterns, droughts and floods in the country. Researchers from Vanderbilt University in the U.S. studied the last 50 years of growth of a stalagmite from Mawmluh Cave in Meghalaya, an area credited as the rainiest place on Earth. The study, published in the journalScientific Reports, found an unexpected connection between winter rainfall amounts in northeast India and climatic conditions in the Pacific Ocean. Winter rainfall following weak monsoon years in India can alleviate water stress for farmers. This distant link between land and ocean records could aid in predicting dry season rainfall amounts in northeast India. Each year, monsoon rains between June and September provide water for roughly 1.5 billion people in India. Changes in monsoon strength and the timing of its onset or withdrawal can trigger either drought or flooding, with devastating consequences, highlighting the need for effective ways to predict and prepare for rainfall variations. Stalagmites from Mawmluh Cave and the surrounding region indicate the recurrence of intense, multiyear droughts in India over the last several thousand years. PTI

Widely translated|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST| Indologist Johannes Hertel in his work The Panchatantra – Text of Purnabhadra (1912), traces the origins of the text to Kashmir. Arthur William Ryder, a Sanskrit professor at University of California, Berkeley, also translated the Panchatantra in English from the 12th century manuscript of Purnabhadra. In the introduction of his work (The Panchatantra: Purnabhadra’s Recension of 1199 CE) he says, “The Panchatantra is a niti-shastra, or textbook of niti”. The word niti means roughly “the wise conduct of life”. Ryder describes Panchatantra as Niti Shastra, which makes it equally interesting for adults. It was perhaps its universal appeal that led to its translation into multiple languages across the world. The first West Asian translation of the Panchatantra was made in Pahlavi, or Middle Persian in the 6th Century (550 CE). Borzuy, a Persian physician visited India and took a copy back with him. This story about Borzuy coming to India and his chance encounter with the Panchatantra is mentioned in Shah Nama. According to Shah Nama, Borzuy went to India in search of the sanjivani (a herb that can bring the dead back to life). He did not find the herb, but met a sage who explained to him, “Through knowledge man becomes revived.” The sage then introduced him to the Panchatantra and the wisdom within. We don’t know why Borzuy came to India. What we know is that it was translated into Pehlavi. The original Pehlavi work is now lost, but an Arabic translation by Ibn al-Muqaffa, did survive. The translation of the Panchatantra in Arabic (Kalilah wa Dimna) is counted among the earliest classical works in Arabic prose.  The Panchatantra is truly a gift to the world by India.

Human brain can detect Earth s magnetic field|Moscow:|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST| A team of scientists has found that the human brain is capable of detecting the Earth’s magnetic field, challenging previous studies. The team, from the California Institute of Technology in the U.S., believes humans were once able to sense the earth’s magnetic field and use it for navigation purposes, just like many other living beings, but eventually lost this skill, the Sputnik News Agency reported. The discovery shows humans have not entirely lost the mechanism of orienting themselves using the magnetic field. The team, including Shinsuke Shimojo, a Professor at the varsity, found the mechanism behind the ability to sense magnetic fields lies in the brain cells’ newly discovered ability to form nanocrystals of the ferromagnetic mineral magnetite. Such crystals, found in many organisms as well, essentially work as micromagnets. Although the nature of their functions in cells has been poorly studied so far, theoretically it can be used to keep track of the Earth’s magnetosphere, they said. To understand it better, researchers placed the small group of participants on a simple chair inside a Faraday cage, which filtered out all outside magnetic fields and then they used the coils installed in the cage to generate an artificially controlled magnetic field. Although the participants did not feel anything, their brains, connected to an electroencephalography (EEG) machine, clearly responded when researchers shifted the direction of the artificial field, the report said. The brain also ignored magnetic fields, which were at least 25 per cent stronger than the one generated by the Earth, meaning various electronic devices, generating such fields cannot affect the brain’s functions.

‘Forgiveness, hope and love’|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Two decades ago, in the middle of the night, a gang led by Dara Singh, a criminal with links to Bajrang Dal, set fire to the jeep of Australian Christian missionary Graham Staines, who was asleep with his two sons, Philip and Timothy. The mob was driven by suspicion of conversions undertaken by Graham in rural Odisha. “It was a turning point for fake news,” says filmmaker Aneesh Daniel, who has closely followed the story for the last 19 years. “Everybody was told about the conversions, it became tenfold and he was killed.”  Truth and investigation From then to now, in the era of WhatsApp, the repercussions of fake news has only intensified, lending Daniel’s film,The Least of These: The Graham Staines Story, contemporary relevance. “The forces of fake news today are stronger when they try to divert the attention,” says the 50-year-old filmmaker. But the central theme of the film and its appeal is “forgiveness, hope and love”, as Graham’s wife, Gladys, demonstrated by pardoning the killers, says Daniel. The film chronicles the story of the Staines family through the eyes of an investigative journalist, played by Sharman Joshi, who tries to uncover the truth behind the allegation of religious conversions. In June 1999, the Wadhwa Commission, headed by Justice DP Wadhwa of the Supreme Court, found Singh guilty but ruled out the involvement of Bajrang Dal as there was no evidence to suggest that any of the persons involved in the crime was a member of either the Bajrang Dal or Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). However, since Gladys forgave the killers but allowed the law to take its course, the Hyderabad-based filmmaker says he refrained from pointing fingers in his film. He has not either mentioned Singh nor hinted at his affiliation with the Bajrang Dal. “Fundamentalists do not have a religion but they have their motives,” declares Daniel, who wanted to contain the film to forgiveness and debunk the fake news that surrounded the Staines’ family and their work. Interestingly, the film is releasing at a time when BJP is in power at the Centre. Does Graham’s story find a renewed relevance? “We started the pre-production of the film in 2014 but wanted to release it in the US first and it takes time to market a film, that is how it is now out so close to the elections,” says Daniel. “That is a challenge for us, but we have not raised any fingers at anyone.” He believes that had the film released during the UPA rule, they would have faced similar apprehensions. “This challenge will be there, irrespective of whatever time it is, because you are standing up and telling the truth,” adds the filmmaker. Speaking of a timely release, how does the filmmaker draw parallels between the communal tensions two decades ago and today? “Communal tension will prevail even 10 years from now. But the challenge was to come out from all thathungamaand tell the story from the perspective of an investigative journalist,” says Daniel, adding that he did not want to glorify the killers by giving them importance in his film. Daniel emphasises thatThe Least of Theseis not a Christian faith film either. Although, Stephen Baldwin, a vocal born-again Christian actor, who plays Graham, has previously featured in faith films likeFaith of Our Fathers(2015) andI’m in Love with a Church Girl(2013). “If you categorise it under faith films then it becomes a propaganda film,” explains Daniel. “But the danger is when faith people start saying this is my film.” For the filmmaker, Graham belongs to everyone who believes in goodwill, not just Christians. Having started his career in the film industry in 1989, Daniel was sure he wanted to make his feature debut with a true story. A year after Graham was murdered, he met Gladys, who asked him to return a year later. When he met her again, she requested him to write a draft and revisit her. Around 2003, he met his writer, Andrew Matthews and their story got Gladys’ approval, but the project took flight only four years ago. With the intention of reaching out to a wider audience, Daniel chose to tell Graham’s story in English. Released in the States last month, the film, which is out in India today, will travel to South Africa (April 12) and Australia (May 16). “Graham’s story has to be heard far and wide for the element of forgiveness to become stronger,” concludes Daniel.  Communal tension will prevail even 10 years from now. But the challenge was to come out from all thathungama[noise] and tell the story from the perspective of an investigative journalist  Communal tension will prevail even 10 years from now.

Spinning a spell|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|An exhibition delving into the various facets of khadi is on at the Bangalore International Centre till April 6. Meanings, Metaphor - Hand-spun and Handwoven in the 21st Century is presented by The Registry of Sarees. The exhibition was previously showcased in Chirala in 2018, and Coimbatore this January which were all outcomes of a study of many cultures and technologies of cotton cultivation in India. The saris were designed and produced between 2000 and 2001, and conceived as a collection of 108 designs. A collection of 108 varieties of cotton fabrics were simultaneously sourced from handloom centres across the country. There will also be a series of talks and conversations as part of the latest showcase - Meanings, Metaphor. Ahalya Matthan, Founder, Director of The Registry of Sarees spoke to Metroplus on the sidelines of the exhibition. Excerpts. Why is the show called Meaning, Metaphor? The curator of the show, Mayank Mansingh Kaul, had the difficult task of finding the relevance of the collection both in its presentation and interpretation. In India today khadi no longer refers to only hand spun, but also includes food and cosmetics. The exhibition hopes to generate an interest in handspun fabric, its finesse, its “humanness” and seeks to find a new meaning or metaphor for such a unique Indian craft. What is the vision for The Registry of Sarees? The Registry of Sarees is a Research and Study Centre with a multi-disciplinary approach that enables design, curatorial and publishing projects in the area of handspun and handwoven textiles. We seek to express our passion for India — its people, history, contemporary culture, lifestyle and crafts through these alternative paths. A studio space and library that caters to the study and documentation of textiles, their design and creation. Curated exhibitions that change the way people understand and experience heritage textiles in the modern context. Learning events that educate through the weaver crafts person’s particular skill or trade. Textile collections that offer unique interpretations of different traditionally practised genres of textile skills. We also have a craft and textile based lifestyle magazine. Could you tell us about the history of the saris you are showcasing? Fifty-one saris out of 108 housed at The Registry of Sarees in Domlur, will be on display. When it was first commissioned in 2000, the collection was christened Khadi – the Fabric of Freedom, and was curated by Martand Singh in collaboration with Rta Kapur Chisti, Rahul Jain and Rakesh Thakore. Rahul Jain’s painstaking study is also documented like a photo album. Where do the weaves of the saris and fabric come from? The sari weaves are from Bengal and Andhra Pradesh. It highlights the use of Jamdani, tri-shuttle weaving and borders such as Jalchurri and Rudraksh. Jalchurri incidentally refers to the whisper of the ripple in water — that is the kind of detail that goes into this weave. Yardage is exhibited in the study with the original swatch book and 108 different counts or weights. Could you elaborate about tri-shuttle weaving and Jamdani? This expo is trying to explain what exactly is hand yarn and hand-spun. Tri-shuttle refers to a third path with the weave apart from the usual warp and weft. It takes a U-turn to create a pattern and a unique, thin pencil border. Jamdani is of Persian origin and has a Mughal influence. The word is made ofjammeaning flower anddanimeaning vase. The name is evocative of the beautiful floral motifs that adorn these gorgeous saris. The Bengali version of the name, Dhakai, comes from the place of its origin — Dhaka in Bangladesh. Jamdani bloomed during the Mughal period. Colonisation saw a decline thanks to the import of cheaper yarn from European countries. The decline of Mughal rule saw producers of Jamdani deprived of their most influential patrons. Villages such as Madhurapur and Jangalbadi, once famous for the intricate Jamdani work faded. Post-Partition, many weavers migrated to West Bengal and that marked the revival of the art form. The base fabric for Jamdani is unbleached cotton yarn and the design is woven using bleached cotton yarn so that a light-and-dark effect is created. The making of Jamdani involves a supplementary weft technique with the standard weft technique. This weaving is closer to tapestry work, where small shuttles of coloured, gold or silver threads are passed through the weft. What do Sandeep Sangaru’s stands add to the display? The showcase of these handmade cotton marvels gets that much more interesting with Sandeep Sangaru’s artistic bamboo stands, where he has tried to evoke the fluidity of a sari. Like hand-spinning cotton, bamboo is sustainable and environmentally friendly. What are the colours and natural dyes used in this collection? The collection is displayed across three floors and the colours include indigo, red, yellow, natural brown and unbleached white cotton. Pure iron for the greys and blacks, original cottons are in white or off-white, the distinctive blue of indigo is made from a natural extract from the leaves of certain plants. Red and pink are from madder, a pigment extracted from the plant Rubia Tinctorum. Yellow is from turmeric plants and the tuber.

Sit up straight...|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Barely two minutes into my interview with Sangeeta Sundaram, one of the few proponents of the Esther Gokhale method for good posture in India, we become extremely aware of how we are sitting. Are our shoulders hunched? Is the spine curved? Is the neck drooping? And that is the main purpose of the Gokhale method, the 43-year-old tells us: “To make you aware of what good posture looks like, so that you can work on bringing it back in your daily life.” Created by Indian-American Esther Gokhale in 1994, the method focusses on restoring the natural alignment of the body, by addressing the root cause of most muscle and joint pain: poor posture. Regaining body wisdom “Nobody is born with an instruction manual on how to use their bodies. We have a kinaesthetic culture, in which we observe each others’ movement patterns and subconsciously mimic it,” says Sangeeta, looking tall in the chair she is sitting in, at Chennai’s Amethyst café. “In the last 100-odd years, as our societies became industrialised, our jobs and lifestyles have changed the way we sit, stand and move,” she says. The Gokhale method, she explains, was formed by observing the postures of people in non-industrialised societies. “It was similar to the postures of children. However, as children grow up, and are made to sit for long hours on school benches — designed for and by adults with poor postures — they lose their body wisdom,” she says. Every bone in the body has a purpose; that is how the human body is structured, explains Sangeeta. Any time the load shifts to muscles that weren’t designed for the purpose, they end up causing pain. “Your original body posture can be brought back, not by force or exercise or training, but by becoming aware of your movement. By noticing how you sit, whether you are lengthening your spine, have your shoulders back, your neck aligned and so on.” As an example, she asks us to roll our shoulders: “Bring your shoulder front, up and back, now let it relax there. Do the same with the other shoulder. This is what your natural position should be like. Simply saying sit up straight won’t work. If you’re conscious about your position, eventually, your bones and muscles will find their way back home.” A lifetime of pain Not everyone who has poor posture has pain issues, but most people with pain issues have poor postures, says Sangeeta. She should know: she was 20 when her back first gave out. After that, pain was a dominant feature in her life. Her work and lifestyle revolved around it. “When you’ve lived with pain for 16 years, you have tried it all… orthopaedic surgeons, physiotherapists, Ayurvedic massages. They all tell you what the treatment should be, but nobody tells you the reason it’s recurring,” she says. In 2012, she took six months off from a high-pressure corporate job, to find a cure once and for all. That’s when she learnt the method from Esther in California, US. “My pain had gone down from being a 7 on an average daily, to 0. I even took up a job that involved travelling and lots of long journeys,” she says. Satisfied, she went to Esther again a year later, this time to train as a teacher.Despite having passed the method down to many students, her pre-teen son still remains impervious to her teachings. “His school and friends are a bigger influence on him than his mother!” she chuckles. To learn more about the Gokhale method, you can reach out to sangeeta@gokhalemethod.com.  Common culprits Gadgets:As they grow smaller and smaller, you tend to become more closed. Your shoulders hunch, neck droops and the spine curves inward, instead of being elongated. Furniture:Most modern furniture is designed so that you sit with your pelvis tucked in. If you had a tail, it would have been under you, instead of behind, like it should be. Vehicles:Car seats are too bucket-y as well. Motorbikes have been modelled after horse saddles, but a horse wouldn’t let you ride if you didn’t sit well, whereas a bike doesn’t give that feedback. Clothing/fashion:Our pants are all too tight, which restrains our waist tilting forward. The fashion industry encourages young girls to thrust their pelvis and bust forward. Footwear:Heels, as we know, push all the weight to the front. Cushioned shoes, on the other hand, don’t give us feedback as to what’s happening on the ground. Not paying attention to how we land affects the knees. We also don’t use our gluteal muscles enough while walking. If we did, we could walk longer without our knees and feet hurting.

Troopers for trees|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Environmentalists have often wondered if youngsters are getting enough information of all that goes into making this planet. Whatever little information is available, is in textbooks, which is not particularly attractive to millennials. Researchers of Nitte University, Mangaluru, have found a solution and created QR codes (Quick Reading Codes) of over 1,900 plants and trees. Now with just a click of their smart phones, all who are interested in plants can access information about the plant life around them. Why QR code? “This generation has little time to read print, hopefully a QR digital code will not only draw their attention, but also give them instant information, scientific names, common names, place of origin and more right on their phones,” says Dr Smitha Hegde, leader of the project titled ‘Tree Coding Project’ from Nitte University. “This, in turn, will also help them identify trees on campus and sensitise them to local flora and fauna, besides giving them experiential inputs that will help them identify varied species,” she added. QR coding of trees is not new and such studies are usually funded. However, the students of this university did it on their own. “We have a 50-acre campus,” says Dr Sathish Bhandary, Vice Chancellor of Nitte University. “Our students, from all streams — medicine, engineering, communication humanities and science take an interest in greenery around them. The QR code also links to related websites, images and text.” The Conservator of Forests, from the State Forest Department, Prakash Natalkar, is also pleased with this initiative. “I had this in mind for a long time, the students of Nitte University have executed it. I went through some of the codes and content and they are perfect. Perhaps, we must also start a project like this in the forest department too. I am sure as every student, teacher and researcher log QR codes, trees will come closer to every person.” Log on Log on   The green brigade that made QR Code a reality include Khyarii Aloysius, Liz Therese, Rohith Rajan, Aprathi M, Thansiya, Chandani, Archana Pai, Vivek MS and Crystal Fernandez.  The team with guidance from Air Commodore Sunil Pai, has planted over 700 trees and plants, out of which, over 270 have been bar-coded.

Get started and keep going|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|In her latest book,The Legends of a Startup Guy, Prachi Garg once again deals with her pet subject, but has presented it in an entirely new form. An entrepreneur herself, Prachi enjoys writing and talking about entrepreneurship. InSuper Woman, Prachi featured inspiring stories of women entrepreneurs. InSuper Sibling, she showed what makes 20 sibling entrepreneurs tick.Super Couplesis about how a shared love for entrepreneurship has been a factor contributing to some couples’ successful marriages. In her new bookThe Legends of a Startup Guy, published by Srishti, she is discussing the subject against the backdrop of Hindu mythology. “According to Hindu mythology, Ganesh’s father, Shiva, beheaded him and later gave him an elephant’s head. I juxtaposed this incident with what the protagonist in this book is going through. Ganesh, who is the main character in my book, is unsuccessful in his first start-up. Ganesh goes to his father Shiv and asks him the way forward. As a caring and concerned father, Shiv shares his knowledge about entrepreneurship that is the result of experience and this sharing boosts Ganesh’s confidence. Here, I compare the elephant head to the vast knowledge and beheading to the removal of negativity from Ganesh’s mind,” she explains. Prachi visits many other people from Hindu mythology: a character named Lakshmi plays angel investor, Kuber is seed funder and Brahma, the research company. Prachi deals with the topic of start-ups with authority as the paths she discusses are those she has passed through in her start-up journeys. Sharing her experiences  Her first start-up, a magazine for MBA aspirants, was a failed venture. She launched her next start-up (www.ghoomophiro.com) when she was studying management at Great Lakes Institute of Management in Chennai. She has seen many ups and down as an entrepreneur, and she says writing about other start-ups has been a learning experience. “Be persistent and never lose hope. As an entrepreneur you will face many challenges. Just trust yourself and your idea,” she says. Prachi loves writing at airports as she travels a lot. “Airports are also where my books sell the most. My books are short and an easy read, so people pick them up,” she says. She has plans to write another book. “It will also be about entrepreneurs. It is a growing community, people relate to it easily and there is a lot of courage in these stories,” the writer adds.

Left, right, centre|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|We had all gathered at a beautiful off-site location for a corporate wellness programme. As I kick-started the session, I asked participants to roll open the mats provided, lay them down in columns, with repeated instructions to leave enough arm space on either side. What followed was not surprising. Mats were laid haphazardly and too close to each other to allow any movement. Everybody’s had to be patiently rearranged. This was just the beginning. During the course of the workshop, we went through several simple exercises, and once again, I witnessed a lack of body and spatial awareness. This isn’t an isolated case. I often see this lack of awareness in people who are comparatively active too. Even minor tweaks that challenge habitual actions — performing an action in reverse order or direction, for instance — seem to leave people movement challenged. It’s usually a case of poor or neglected kinaesthetics. What is that, you ask? An innate sense Kinaesthetics relates to a person’s sensory awareness of the position and movement of various parts of the body — to know where these parts are in relation to each other, in relation to space, and how they move individually and collectively. Kinaesthetic awareness is what contributes quality to movement and makes it more than actions. It forms the basis that helps one know how movement is to be executed and how it feels. Irony of adulthood Ever seen a baby grip a rattle toy with tiny fingers for the first time? The number of times the baby hits it on the face trying to get it into the mouth? A few clumsy but determined tries and then, success! Body and spatial awareness is an innate sense that progressively develops in us humans as we grow into adulthood. Performing relatively more complex movements should then come naturally. Yet, many adults struggle even with simple ones. Reclaiming awareness We need to keep alive and hone our body/spatial awareness to perform movement, especially qualitative ones. This provides physical benefits: fewer stresses, strains and injuries. You’re less likely to trip, for instance. But it also has mental benefits: greater sharpness, awareness, control, and the joy of being able to perform! Body awareness is a powerful quality. It can be empowering and energising. Think of a dancer. A good dancer can leave anyone awestruck by the quality of her/his movements. It’s like watching poetry in motion. The sense of control is strong. None of it is accidental. Use it or lose it Coordination and movement need practice. Practising quick direction changes, manoeuvring simple obstacles, changing/tweaking regular movement patterns periodically, trying new ones and performing composite movements help develop heightened body and spatial awareness. Play games that need mental and physical coordination — such as dodge ball. Being an adult doesn’t mean giving up on fun. Try learning a sport or activity that challenges you in multiple directions. Playing with kids can be a great way of developing skills for all. Balance-building exercises too help develop body awareness. Not everyone has or wants to develop dancer-level skills. But everyone should work on acquiring basic skills of movement and reclaim the power and control that comes with body awareness. Without it we underutilise our superior abilities as humans and do ourselves injustice.

‘Every state has its version of laksa’|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|“Malaysian cuisine is all about spices,” says David Nathan who with his wife Chef Jessica rustled up a spread of Malaysian food at The Courtyard. The food, though, was not prepared to cater to the Indian palate, rather, it stayed true to authentic Malaysian dishes while also experimenting with contemporary twists here and there. David and Jessica are both natives of Malaysia, yet they hail from different regions and hence, even their cuisine is different. “One of the items on the menu is laksa,” says David, referring to the spicy noodle soup. “Every state has its version of laksa. For this menu, we had two varieties of it. One is Asam laksa, which is made by the Penang people, who came from China and immigrated to Malaysia and married the Malay people. They introduced Chinese cuisine but not the exact cuisine. The other is Sarawak laksa,” says David, adding that Jessica is from an indigenous group from Sarawak. The twist that David has introduced to the Asam laksa was ravioli. “The asam laksa has thick, round noodles, but instead of that we used ravioli. The noodles was prepared in a contemporary style.” The original Sarawak laksa has rice noodles. “We included pasta instead of rice noodles,” informs Jessica. The rendang too was presented in a slightly different way. “We did not serve it with the traditional rice, but with Cheong Fun- a Chinese rice noodles. The red curry remained as Malay style curry.” Another item on the menu was the Perankan dish, Pie Tee, which is a pastry comprising a crispy tart shell filled with slices of fish (mostly prawn) and vegetables. “The shell is made with dough that we dry in the sun. And the dip is made of fermented shrimp. The pastry shell is then put in a brass mould that is put in oil and then we repeat the process,” says David. The desserts included cendol a popular street food, which is made from corn starch and served with shaved ice. “We used the green colour from the Pendang leaf,” says David. Jessica says her culinary career started in Bon Ton Langkawi. “There I worked under Narelle McMurtrie. And then I moved from handling service and purchasing to the kitchen. I am a self-taught chef,” says Jessica who pays close attention to detail. Jessica and David later started their own catering business Larder by 23aubergine. The Courtyard Food project was held in March, and was a collaboration with Chef Kanishka Sharma of Courtyard and other international chefs. A group of 20 to 25 people came together for the community dining.

Alopecia areata|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Last week, the sister noticed a small patch of hair missing on the scalp above her left ear. Worried our parents would blame her curling iron for it, and confiscate the device, she resorted to calling me instead. She had what docs call Alopecia areata apparently a common condition, affecting over a million people in India. Hair falls in patches — generally, from the scalp — and in more severe cases, eyelashes, and eyebrows. “Though the exact reason for it is not established, the main postulated theory is that it is a specific type of autoimmune disease,” says Chennai dermatologist Dr Deepika Lunawat. Which essentially means that the body’s immune system starts acting against its own hair follicles, resulting in hair loss. “It is a polygenic (caused by multiple genes) disorder. Studies have shown that environmental factors such as high stress levels, low amounts of zinc and iron in the body, trigger the condition in an individual who is already genetically susceptible,” she says. If people in your family have had it as well, or if you have other autoimmune conditions, you are more likely to get it. “There is no complete cure for alopecia areata, but there are medications available to curtail the disease activity,” she says. “Topicals such as corticosteroids, when applied on the affected patchy areas, decrease inflammation, and encourage hair growth.” The other option, said the doctor, is immunotherapy and phototherapy. Oral medications are available as well, but doctors don’t often prescribe them, especially in teenagers, as it can affect growth. “If topical therapy isn’t responding, I would prefer intralesional corticosteroids over oral: you inject the medication into the patches, so that the effect is more concentrated,” she says. Despite the emotional or psychological toll of hair loss, the good news is that it is mostly cosmetic in nature, and not symptomatic of any underlying issues. You can expect your hair to return within two to six months. In this column, we demystify the buzzwords in wellness.

My contribution is significant|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|I was cast in a small role, in a theatrical production, recently. While the role was small, I believed it was important. Yet, when I got off the stage after our first performance, I asked myself if my role was required at all. Such thoughts that coursed through me made me feel less of who I was and I slipped into despondency. Feeling unimportant did not help, so I re-examined the role I had played. A concept that I learnt in college helped me process my thoughts. ‘Hygiene factor’, is the belief that the presence of a factor, trait or what have you may not add materially to enhancing value, yet its absence will certainly diminish the effect. In applying this thought to my predicament, I realised that while the role I played may not have added much body to the scene I acted in, yet without it, the scene I was cast to act in would have lacked depth. My appearance in the role provided context for effective enactment by the protagonist. The thought was very enabling and restored me, thus reducing my feeling unimportant. In my not being or wanting to see merit in what I was commissioned to do, I seemed to sabotage myself. As a young adult, I was once told ‘what you do unto yourself, you do to others’; if therefore I cannot appreciate myself, I may not be able to appreciate others. Small or otherwise, my contribution was important. Not acknowledging this to self only causes pain, disappointment and sadness in me. The writer is an organisational and behavioural consultant.

Bald, brave, beautiful|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Whether it is Anjali inThe Trip, Golu Gupta inMirzapuror Shaalu inMasaan, there is spunk and energy that permeates all of Shweta Tripathi Sharma’s characters. Talking to the actor makes it obvious where it comes from. After nine films, Shweta’s love for her work is evident, and she is happy with the experience of her new film,Gone Kesh, which released across the country recently. “I am one of those who will not do anything and just sit at home if I don’t like the work coming my way. I want to do a project with the right intentions and not money, popularity or to be busy. I am not even concerned about being “out of sight, out of mind” because if that is the motivation then I won’t give my 110% to work. Whatever project I may be doing, I have to give it 200% otherwise there is no point in doing it,” she shares. Support system In some ways, her character inGone Kesh, Enakshi is similar to Shweta in real life. “I have had a simple life. I have amazing support from family, a great set of friends and financially and emotionally, I have been quite balanced,” says the actor. When she read the script, written by Qasim Khallow, Shweta was bowled over with the beautiful handling of the delicate subject. “The emotions and relationships between Enakshi, her parents and her friends are the heart of the film. I realised that with any illness or condition, physically one person goes through it but their family and loved ones also go through it with them. It is this journey of her family and friends. Her dream is to become a dancer. But with alopecia, the way you perceive yourself changes; you do not want to step out of the house. You know people will be staring, pointing, taunts and jokes will come your way. This drives people into a shell, which is heartbreaking,” she emphasises. Alopecia is a disease that attacks hair follicles and causes hair to fall in large quantities forming bald patches. “I had no idea such a disease even existed. That is when you feel ignorant and small,” she confesses. She was ecstatic to be offered this project. “I kept thinking how cool this opportunity is and how many actors would even get a chance to do something like this. I was, in fact, thankful that this role came to me. When I got to know that the poster would have me bald, I was even happier because it is easy to look fabulous in a poster with a great photographer, a stylist and a whole team behind you.” Character sketches Playing a character that ages in the film brought new challenges for Shweta. “I got a chance to play a girl who grows up as the film progresses. It was challenging to understand how she deals with her condition and how it changes her. It showcases her journey from denial to acceptance.” Along with any film that deals with a medical condition comes a responsibility to portray it realistically and she was aware of that. “People who have alopecia should see the film and be able to relate to it. Thankfully, after watching the trailer, my Instagram was flooded with messages and photos from people suffering from the condition. Also, for people who knew others who had alopecia, who felt guilty because somewhere they felt they had been insensitive. I was happy because as a society if we accept our faults and be more sensitive and supportive towards each other — alopecia or not — it is great. Let us just be there for each other,” implores the actor.  It was challenging to understand how she deals with her condition (alopecia) and how it changes her. It showcases her journey from denial to acceptance.

They are the champions|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|It took more than a decade for Ameesha Joshi and Anna Sarkissian, two independent filmmakers from Canada, to document the rise of Indian women boxers. The iconic Mary Kom is the central figure of the documentary,With This Ring, recently uploaded for public viewing on YouTube. A well-researched effort, it also captures the gripping journey of Sarita Devi and Chhoto Loura, champions from Northeast India. “I could only imagine the criticism, even ridicule, these young women must have faced, yet, they were winning medals internationally. They were trailblazers in the truest sense. I admired their strength of character and felt a strong desire to make this film and share their stories around the globe,” says Ameesha, on the reason behind picking women boxers as the subject. The film, shot extensively on location in India and overseas, includes some breathtaking training sessions, apart from footage from the competitions. Anna was not even interested in boxing as a sport. “I am fascinated by women’s stories, particularly those that are absent from the mainstream. When I found out about these women, and the unconventional directions they have chosen, I knew they would have interesting stories to share — stories worthy of being made into a documentary,” notes Anna. At the end of the 10-year toil, Ameesha is pleased. “There was nothing easy about making this film.” Anna agrees, “We have worked on this project along with our regular paying jobs for more than 10 years. We worked on it in the evenings and on weekends. We had our ups and downs along the way. When you’re in the thick of it, it can feel hopeless and interminable... We had very little funding.” Mary Kom and Sarita Devi have come to symbolise the modern Indian sportswoman — daring in venturing into little-known zones. “It’s been encouraging to observe the significant change in society’s acceptance of women in more ‘masculine’ sports, since we began filming in 2006. I think the power of mainstream movies likeMary KomandDangalhad an impact on changing people’s mindset and are indicators that society is progressing — but I still feel we have a long way to go,” says Ameesha. Anna points out the difference between women boxers from India and Canada. “We were quite surprised to see how many resources were being poured into the women’s boxing programme in India, compared with other countries. In Canada, for example, the boxers have no funding. It’s just their hobby. They train at their own gym; they need to find jobs to support themselves, and try to fund-raise to attend competitions. The Indian team has facilities, funding for education, and a generous travel allowance to send a full roster to competitions around the globe. Their Government jobs mean that they have a pension for life, without having to show up for work every day.” Does motherhood promote or impede a sportswoman’s ambitions to venture out? Ameesha feels it depends on the attitude of the partner. “Two of our characters, Mary and Sarita, married men that champion their careers. Mary’s husband Onler stayed at home to parent their twin boys, so she could continue to train full-time. Sarita continued to work as hard as ever post the birth of her son.” Anna agrees, “Some people say the busier you are, the more you can accomplish. I would imagine Mary has almost no time for herself! Sarita also has a child, and has managed to keep going. Mary and Sarita both have very supportive husbands who have put their own careers on hold to help their wives fulfil their own ambitions.”

When silence speaks louder|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Most of us were fascinated with Amitabh Bachchan’s performance in the filmBlack, where he works with a young girl who is sight and hearing impaired. Now, Big B lends his voice to a short filmWhite,directed by Bengaluru boy Manu Nag. The film talks about eye donation. Though Manu has worked as an associate director for many films in the Malayalam film industry, this is his debut as a director. The six-minute film, which stars Priyamani and a dog named Rocky, is produced by S Rajashekar and Sijijayadevan is DOP. “I thought about the concept forWhitein 2016. I had also watched many Korean short films and that made me think that this medium has an audience and a massive reach. I decided to write the script ofWhite. I had done a few films with Priyamani and worked with her in Yograj Bhat’s Kannada filmDana Kayonu. One day, I narrated the story to her and she agreed to act in my film. That boosted my confidence.” Next on Manu’s bucket list was to make a film that would “reach people beyond Karnataka. No matter how short, I wanted to make my film in style and launch in a big way. I also wanted it to appeal to all. So, I stuck to a no-dialogue format using only the visual medium to communicate. The only voice you will hear is the voice over,” explains Manu, who shares how Amitabh Bachchan came to be a part ofWhite. “Having him do the voice over is a dream come true. I wanted a voice and a face that would appeal to the nation and thought of Amitabh sir. I had no way to reach out to him and wondered if he will even agree to work with a nobody like me.” The music director ofWhite, Lovv Mehta, who hails from Mumbai, played Santa and made Manu’s dream come true. “Lovv’s friend is close to Mr Bachchan and through him I was invited to Mumbai. Mr. Bachchan heard out the concept, script and took a copy of it. After 15 days, I received his audio. He had gone to a studio on his own, recorded his voice and sent it across. I was bowled over and literally did somersaults,” beams a happy Manu. Big B speaks in Hindi in the film and it has a social message about eye donation. “When people like him back small projects like mine, the visibility and reach is immense.” Manu was born and brought up in Bengaluru and studied commerce in Basaveshwara College. “When I was studying, my professors asked me to readThe Hindu. Today, I can not believe I am being written about in the same paper that I read as a student!” Coming from a “middle class family, I always dreamt of making films, but steered clear of the field as I did not have a strong financial backing. Today, making a film has also become a reality,” smiles Manu, who soon plans to make a full-length feature film. Manu releasedWhiteat Karnataka Chalanachitra Kalavidara Sangha on March 30 with actor Radhika Pandit doing the honours. The film is now available on Lahari YouTube Channel.

Where did these fables come from?|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|People believe that the Panchatantra tales were told at the time of King Amarashakti, who appointed a scholar named Vishnu Sharma to educate his three sons. Vishnu Sharma realised that traditional methods of teaching would not work well with the princes. So he decided to teach them his lessons through stories. He narrated the stories to them in the oral-aural tradition. He wrote the stories into a collection under five volumes. It was named Panchatantra (‘pancha’ – five and ‘tantra’ – systems): [1] Mitra labha(gaining friends) – Collection of stories related to winning friends. [2] Mitra bheda(losing friends) – Collection of stories related to losing friends. [3] Aparïksitakárakam(acting without thinking) – Collection of stories about how imprudence leads to losing what is important. [4] Labdhapranásam(Loss of gains) – Collection of stories that mention how to come out of difficult situations without losing things. [5] Kákolùkïyam(Crows and owls) – Collection of stories about rules and strategies of war and peace.

Nature-based is the new organic|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The word organic conjures up images of women with arched, minimally-plucked eyebrows, wearing linen pants (that takes an army to wash and iron), shopping for produce, with wicker baskets. Organic today is associated with everything it should not be: exclusive, expensive, and certification-driven. It’s the sort of thing us city-slickers ‘indulge’ in, when we’re out picturing happy farmers scattering seeds (also from wicker baskets) in sunny climes. Hell, it’s the Indian version of terroir that we imagine artisanal carrots come from. This is just one of the reasons environmentalists, agriculturalists, and nutritionists are now talking about nature-based. Nature is easy to understand. It’s the sun, the earth, water, sans the frills, because it’s also about bees, earthworms, and red ants — yes, the kind that bite. Where organic has become a bunch of products, nature-based is not just about what we eat or wear or put on our faces. It is about preserving and restoring the earth and everything on it — including us human beings and our health. It’s a broad term that includes everyone — scientists and the wicker-basket-toting auntie (me). It’s also easy to understand. For instance, each time I walk into a mall, I can ask myself: ‘Is this nature-based?’ No. Cue to walk out and into a green space. It’s possible to help children role-model the idea. Nature-based means: ‘Let’s all get off our screens and go out and play a game of badminton.’ How would you help a five-year-old child comprehend organic? More than just semantics though, nature-based is a direct reminder that we are losing touch with our natural environment. It helps us notice the trees, bird sounds, even bugs, no matter how concretised our cities. It also helps us reject what is not from Nature: packaged and junk foods, chemical-laden beauty concoctions, fast fashion. What would it really mean if we were to live a nature-based lifestyle in a built-up environment? That we find our way in the world while in sync with Nature, that we build in spaces that Nature has given us, use only what we need, work with it, rather than against it. In real terms, it means saying goodbye to smart buildings, letting the weather cue bodily actions (yes, that siesta in the summer months), eating what Nature gives us (not what ‘big’ agriculture does), wearing clothes to go with the season (goodbye summer jacket). Sadly, the Cult of Organic has pushed us into consumerism of a different kind, turning a good thing into something that can be bought, much like that certification.

Complementing the narrative|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Cinematographer Karthik Ghattamaneni is never seen at social gatherings and official functions. He is uncomfortable when facing a camera but at ease behind one. “I just go to Tirupati after the film wraps up and pray for success, then I detach myself,” he shares. His filmChitralahariis set to release on April 12. AfterKrishnarjuna Yuddham, Karthik did not take up any project for a long time, as he was committed to work on an untitled project to be directed by Praveen Sattaru. Unfortunately, that got shelved after a spade work of six to seven months. He had to give up around six offers for this project during that time. Kishore Tirumala’sChitralahariis the kind of cinema happening these days, the kind that works for Karthik. Until then, he had been getting only mass type of films. Commenting on his choice, Karthik states that there is no guarantee that films big in scale will work, but films likeChitralahariirrespective of the result, make him happy. He can contribute to the staging part and there is scope for creative freedom and discussions, as well as enough space and time to take the shots. He has different strategies of camera placements for each director and film. He shares, “For three minutes of footage, you might take 10 or 15 shots but for the same footage in another film, there could be 50 shots and you do not know if you are doing right or wrong. You can take too many shots if the planning is good. Sometimes for a formula film, on the day of shoot there is discussion happening, content improvisation happens on the spot and shot speed becomes problematic as we would not be ready. With spontaneous people, the process is different. With such directors around, I do key lighting only when actors starts performing; but in films likeAwe, we did the lighting first and then called the actor for the shot. Each project has a different demand. Spontaneous shoot works with directors who are collaborative.” Karthik comes from Rajiv Menon’s school where he was taught that if cinematography is clearly evident that means you are doing something wrong. If people say it is amazing then you messed it up. If your work supports it, then it becomes an invisible art form. He recalls his past two films and the feedback, “When people said lighting scheme inAwewas amazing, it meant they didn’t watch the film. ForNinnu Korithey said the film is nice and that is because they got connected to the story. After a point they are not seeing cinematography, but the characters and their story.” Karthik adds, “Both camera and story should travel together. Rajiv Menon would say if you are concentrating on photography, why choose films? For films of Sanjay Leela Bhansali, we see grandeur and we expect it, so we can show it on a big scale. When a character is living in a simple house, I don’t believe in elevating the scale.” He reveals directors like Sekhar Kammula, Kranti Madhav, Kishore Tirumala are smarter, they do not come up with their idea of their shot; they talk of content and want cinematographers to contribute. Only when they are not satisfied, do they suggest. They wait for the technician’s contribution, hoping their idea might be better. They value inputs.”   For three minutes of footage, you might take 15 or 10 shots but for the same footage in another film, there could be 50 shots

When colours tell a story|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|A maze of colours meets the eye at the Acropolis Building on Dr Radhakrishnan Salai. Against the earthen background, the maze, with an impressive mix of both contemporary and traditional works of art, stands out in the otherwise grey ground floor. Some new paintings by upcoming artists immediately catch my attention for their rebellious use of colour and concepts: Be it Manisha Parekh’s work with knots jutting out from a black background, representing hair follicles on a head, or colourful chairs stacked up in different heights, forming a grid of bright colours. A realistic painting by Diptish Ghose Dastidar of a man lazily resting his foot on a bicycle, the handle of which sports a tiny plastic bag of flowers, surprises me with its sheer detailing; it’s an exact replica of a scene from a nearby street. Painting Lives, an exhibition-sale cum auction organised by the Rotary Club of Madras in collaboration with Apparao Galleries, has something for everyone; the display caters to art connoisseurs of various age groups. The collection has been divided into two sections, according to Hemu Ramaiah of the Rotary Club of Madras. Hemu, along with Shanno Ravi and Sharan Apparao of Apparao galleries, spearheaded this project with an aim to put together a diverse collection. On one side are 62 paintings that are exclusively meant for auction, while on the other, are those that can be bought. “This is the largest fundraiser that the Rotary does every year, which is meant for charity. We are trying to extend the concept of art to the younger generation,” says Hemu. Most often, galleries put up works of the masters, which may not be affordable to everyone. Through this initiative, the Rotary Club plans to change this trend. They also wish to inculcate a sense of appreciation for art among the youth. The proceeds from the auction, go towards ongoing projects of the Club; this includes construction of a school for the children of Tsunami survivors. Painting Lives features works from all over India. Hemu says, “India is a great place for emerging artists. We contacted a lot of galleries across the country, and they sent in a range of works. We went through the collection and looked at what would appeal to the Chennai audience.” Apart from emerging artists, works by artists like Anjolie Ela Menon, Manjunath Kamath, Rekha Rodwittiya, and Akkitham Narayanan also feature in this collection. Kamath’s work on the human-animal dichotomy on a bright red background, seemed like an extension of his series which was recently on display at the Chennai Photo Biennale. Quirky and interesting sculptures too, are placed between the canvases and a few photographs make an appearance in between. An interesting sculpture of a golden fan made of metal nuts, stands hidden amidst the overload of colours. The maze does provide interesting options, which definitely qualify as collectibles. Painting Lives will be on display from 12 pm to 8 pm everyday, at the Acropolis, Dr Radhakrishnan Salai, till April 12. The auction will take place on April 5, at 6.30 pm, at Hyatt Regency, Chennai. Those interested in the auction can call 9884041020, 9841289637.

Modern literature of Europe|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST| Jean de La Fontaine in 17th century France wrote a story-collection known as La Fontaine’s Fables. For his oriental stories he drew heavily from the Panchatantra and used animals as characters. In the introduction of his second book, Fontaine writes, “I say as the recognition of gratitude: Mostly I owe the Indian wise "Bulba" (a reference to the imagined author of the Panchatantra), that this book has been translated into all the languages". The Panchatantra is truly a gift to the world by India.

Left, right, centre|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|We had all gathered at a beautiful off-site location for a corporate wellness programme. As I kick-started the session, I asked participants to roll open the mats provided, lay them down in columns, with repeated instructions to leave enough arm space on either side. What followed was not surprising. Mats were laid haphazardly and too close to each other to allow any movement. Everybody’s had to be patiently rearranged. This was just the beginning. During the course of the workshop, we went through several simple exercises, and once again, I witnessed a lack of body and spatial awareness. This isn’t an isolated case. I often see this lack of awareness in people who are comparatively active too. Even minor tweaks that challenge habitual actions — performing an action in reverse order or direction, for instance — seem to leave people movement challenged. It’s usually a case of poor or neglected kinaesthetics. What is that, you ask? An innate sense Kinaesthetics relates to a person’s sensory awareness of the position and movement of various parts of the body — to know where these parts are in relation to each other, in relation to space, and how they move individually and collectively. Kinaesthetic awareness is what contributes quality to movement and makes it more than actions. It forms the basis that helps one know how movement is to be executed and how it feels. Irony of adulthood Ever seen a baby grip a rattle toy with tiny fingers for the first time? The number of times the baby hits it on the face trying to get it into the mouth? A few clumsy but determined tries and then, success! Body and spatial awareness is an innate sense that progressively develops in us humans as we grow into adulthood. Performing relatively more complex movements should then come naturally. Yet, many adults struggle even with simple ones. Reclaiming awareness We need to keep alive and hone our body/spatial awareness to perform movement, especially qualitative ones. This provides physical benefits: fewer stresses, strains and injuries. You’re less likely to trip, for instance. But it also has mental benefits: greater sharpness, awareness, control, and the joy of being able to perform! Body awareness is a powerful quality. It can be empowering and energising. Think of a dancer. A good dancer can leave anyone awestruck by the quality of her/his movements. It’s like watching poetry in motion. The sense of control is strong. None of it is accidental. Use it or lose it Coordination and movement need practice. Practising quick direction changes, manoeuvring simple obstacles, changing/tweaking regular movement patterns periodically, trying new ones and performing composite movements help develop heightened body and spatial awareness. Play games that need mental and physical coordination — such as dodge ball. Being an adult doesn’t mean giving up on fun. Try learning a sport or activity that challenges you in multiple directions. Playing with kids can be a great way of developing skills for all. Balance-building exercises too help develop body awareness. Not everyone has or wants to develop dancer-level skills. But everyone should work on acquiring basic skills of movement and reclaim the power and control that comes with body awareness. Without it we underutilise our superior abilities as humans and do ourselves injustice.

Nature’s way|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Coimbatore Parenting Network (CPN), a peer support group on Facebook, has over 7,000 members. Swati Jagdish, a group administrator, talks about how discussions around parenting are changing, right from birth. “Parents are exploring alternative schooling methods for their children, people are moving to traditional and organic diets, and the same is happening with birthing,” she says. “We want to go back to Nature.” This is against the background of women gaining authority over their own bodies. The growing awareness on alternative birthing practices is just one of the many reasons why women are opting for natural birthing. There is a lot of information available on social media related to this, that helps women make an informed birth choice. Drawing from experience Swati draws on her own experience: “I was shocked when I was asked to take progesterone suppositories (which are recommended only for someone with a history of miscarriages). That decided it for me, and at 16 weeks, I decided to go to the Birth Village, a natural birthing centre in Kochi. They clarified my doubts and assured me that there was a super-speciality hospital within five kilometres reach in the case of an emergency. Most importantly, they treat an expectant mother with dignity and respect.” Haritha P, who holds ante-natal classes and is a lactation counsellor at her centre Thalir in Madurai, says natural birthing is a normal physiological process that can be achieved without any medical intervention in the case of a healthy woman. “Millions of women, starting with our own great grandmothers have given birth with the help of abai. Now, there are midwives. For my first child, I had to undergo an emergency C-section. For my second child, I came up with a birthing plan from day one, as I was clear about a vaginal birth. At 36 weeks, the hospital ruled out a normal delivery, as my scan report showed that the baby weight wouldn’t allow it. With just two more weeks to go, I convinced my family, and over Skype, consulted with the Birth Village.” Harita did end up having a natural birth. Questioning the system Pregnant women have started asking the right questions and that is driving the change, says Swati. “They are aware of the birth plan that the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends. They also know that they can say no to an epidural or episiotomy. Most hospitals will listen if you start asking questions.” A woman must know her rights, says Haritha. “An expectant mother has the right to give or withhold her consent for anything from an IV drip to an epidural. She has to be aware of the risks, benefits and alternatives that are available. Support and awareness among extended family also matter.” There are a number of informative videos on YouTube that throw light on the subject: the ‘breast crawl’ videos of the WHO and UNICEF highlight the skin-to-skin contact between the newborn and mother that is recommended immediately after birthing. There are helpful books as well. “In Dr Marsden Wagner’s book,Creating Your Birth Plan,theauthor cites the unnecessary reasons recommending C-section births. But there are those doctors like Dr Fatima Poonawala in Bengaluru, who stick to a birth plan and carry out only natural birthing without any interventions,” says Swati, who runs Bond & Beyond, a centre for pregnancy health, lactation and post-partum counselling.

The umbilical cord is allowed to fall off naturally.”  The other view A midwife-delivery is fine in a hospital environment, but one has to be aware of risks at home, warns gynaecologist Dr Asha Rao, Director, Rao Hospital, Coimbatore. “If there is an emergency, there should be a doctor at hand,” she says. “Home deliveries worked in the olden days as lifestyles were different. Women did a lot of work, bending, sweeping, and squatting. Now, we are not doing as much physical work and the movement of the baby down the birth passage is not that easy,” she says. She adds that complications have increased, with more women having babies in their later years, and the rise in the incidence of lifestyle diseases such as diabetes and PCOD. Dr Rao feels that obstetrics works better under centralised care, where there is a complete support system. “It is a better option that is geared up in case of complications in the mother or the child.”  A bigger heart  A woman’s blood volume increases and her heart grows bigger during pregnancy. This ensures that there is enough oxygenated blood supplied to the foetus.

The wellness proposition|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|If you boil wellness down to its basics, it’s fairly uncomplicated: good health for as long as possible. It’s a journey that takes you through life’s ups and downs, with your body and mind reminding you to rest, eat wholesome food, stay active through the day, and laugh a little with family and friends. The in-road The problem is that we’re mostly out of sync with our bodies and minds because of our lifestyles of sitting and screens, and a disconnection from community and Nature. And where there is emptiness, the devil — let’s call him the marketeer — steps in, with a product for every niggling ‘problem’. A generation ago, health communication was often centred around fear-mongering, as in the case of anti-tobacco advertising or even cooking oil. It was a ‘give up the cigarette or else…’, or ‘buy this brand of oil or else…’ line. Today, fear-mongering has been turned on its head, says Vijay Raaghavan, Associate Director — Management Consulting, Healthcare, PwC, Bengaluru. “Communication is tuned to assuage fears we already have. So if I see the product is ‘all-natural’, ‘pollutant-free’, and I’m already worried about a polluted city, it’s pandering to it. But it’s always a set of pleasant-sounding words that are used, like ‘healing’,” he says. What’s changed is the approach to branding and packaging. While companies are spending more on R&D, it’s also true that “they use information from existing health research selectively,” says Dr Senthil Reddi, Additional Professor, Department of Psychiatry, NIMHANS, Bengaluru. The messaging is usually aligned with the socio-economic class that has the most disposable income. Out and about With social-media explosion, peer pressure is at its highest, and now extends through multiple age groups. “Travel to say, Paris and London is passé. It’s got to be to some exotic location,” says Janaki Abraham, Associate Professor, Department of Sociology, University of Delhi. In the same vein, rice gets substituted with quinoa, or whatever grain a celebrity is eating or a social-media influencer is pushing. On their part, influencers need to live (and show) the most authentic life possible. Take Jacqueline Fernandez, Pilates poster girl, who has a stake in Raw Pressery. She must not just lead a healthful life, but also prove she does on social media and at events. “Trust is key, which thanks to a serious trust-deficit in every sphere, is at an all-time low,” says Delhi-based Sanghamitra Chakraborty, who editedPreventionandWomen’s Healthmagazines when they were in the country, and who now editsReader’s Digest. So, she says, people tend to spend money on big brands with science-backed claims, feeling that they can be trusted. Also, she says we’ve simply outsourced our health, turning to dieticians, life coaches, personal trainers, when we all know what we really need to do. What is it about the exotic that lures us? The more complex a product sounds, the more aspirational it is. So out goes the face cream and in come day and night creams, among the arsenal of products you’re supposed to use for healthy skin. Raaghavan cites words that are key: organic, cold-pressed, virgin, gut health, all requiring a great deal of background reading. This makes it exclusive. It signifies you have a certain level of English language comprehension, data access, disposable income. The market calls these better-for-you products. “It’s a licence to charge more,” he says. Above and beyond “In some way, the crisis in health had to lead to this,” says Abraham. “Unfortunately, it’s so linked to money and has become another product that can only be consumed by some.” But that is how it is worldwide. Carol Singh started a cold-pressed juice brand in 2014, called Antidote. At the time, she says people had no awareness around the concept, but they were curious. “Around 2016, there was a bombardment of natural products, beauty products, supplements. Suddenly, brands were jumping on the wellness bandwagon. Now everyone wants to be in this space, know about it, talk about it.” She and co-founder Nadia Singh, felt the dialogue was getting diluted, so they began what they call Vitality Hours, a day-long event which began as an invite-only affair, and is now a platform where they put urban folk in touch with wellness professionals: yoga ‘gurus’, alternative medicine specialists, nutritionists. Next weekend, they’ll do their first two-day event. She’s candid about the fact that products and services in the wellness space are exclusive and more expensive, but also says it’ll trickle down. In a sense, it already has, if we look at the success of Patanjali that Baba Ramdev says will overtake HUL in the next financial year. Whether Patanjali (Saundarya Aloe Vera Gel, Neem Kanti Body Cleanser) or any of HUL’s brands (Dove, Lever Ayush) are actually facilitating wellness is anyone’s guess, but it’s clear there’s a market for them. This spread of wellness into the FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) segment is rooted to linking professionals — either doctors or others from the medical fraternity — with products. Take activated charcoal. Before it became popular in everything from burgers to smoothies, beauty brands used it. One product claim says it: “easily absorbs and lifts away the black impurities and pollution particles”, and “reveals your natural pure-looking white skin,” playing into insecurities at many levels. A recent change “It’s only over the past decade or so that we’ve learnt what the sun protection factor (SPF) is, or what an ‘active ingredient’ in a beauty product is. Beauty brands began moving into the dermat space,” says Chakraborty. Dermatologists also spoke on behalf of companies, much like how dieticians spoke on behalf of say, almond or olive-oil brands. Packaging and labelling for beauty products world-over changed, to be minimalistic, almost medicinal — it was not an indulgence anymore; it was a downright necessity. On the whole though, people don’t see the attention to wellness as bad: it is an awareness, after all. If it makes you happy to wear a hearable rather than a hearing aid, and you can afford to pay for the pop colours, you’ve landed on wellness. For the rest of us, there’s always preventive health.    A generation ago, health communication was often centred on fear-mongering  Tracking consumers In 2012, PwC did one of its earliest reports on the wellness consumer, drawing up a pyramid that traced the development of a consumer from passive to beginner, active, and finally a believer.

Bald, brave, beautiful|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Whether it’s Ananya inThe Trip, Golu Gupta inMirzapuror Shaalu inMasaan, there is spunk and energy that permeates all of Shweta Tripathi Sharma’s characters. Talking to the actor makes it obvious where it comes from. After nine films, Tripathi Sharma’s love for her work is evident, and she’s happy with the experience of her new film,Gone Kesh, which released across the country on Friday. “I am one of those who will not do anything and just sit at home if I don’t like the work coming my way. I want to do a project with the right intentions — not money or popularity or to be busy. Whatever project I may be doing, I have to give it my 200%, otherwise there is no point in doing it,” she shares. Support system In some ways, her character inGone Kesh, Enakshi, is similar to Tripathi Sharma in real life. “I have had a simple life. I have amazing support from family, a great set of friends; financially and emotionally, I have been quite balanced,” says the actor. When she read the script written by Qasim Khallow, Tripathi Sharma was bowled over by the beautiful handling of the delicate subject. “The emotions and the relationships between Enakshi and her parents and her friends are the heart of the film. I realised that with any illness or condition, the individual might go through it physically, but their family and loved ones also go through the emotional turmoil. It is this journey of her family and friends. Her dream is to become a dancer. But with alopecia, the way you perceive yourself changes; you don’t want to step out of the house. This drives people into a shell, which is heartbreaking,” she emphasises. Alopecia is a disease that attacks the hair follicles and causes hair to fall in large quantities forming bald patches. “I had no idea such a disease even existed. That’s when you feel so ignorant and small,” she confesses. She was ecstatic to be offered this project. “I kept thinking how cool this opportunity was and how many actors wouldn’t even get a chance to do something like this! When I got to know that the poster would have me bald, I was even happier because it’s easy to look fabulous with a great photographer, a stylist and a whole team behind you.” Playing a character as she ages in the film brought new challenges for the actor. “I got a chance to play a girl who grows up as the film progresses. It was challenging to understand how she deals with her condition and how it changes her. It showcases her journey from denial to acceptance.”  It was challenging to understand how she deals with her condition (alopecia) and how it changes her. It showcases her journey from denial to acceptance.
Alopecia areata|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Last week, the sister noticed a small patch of hair missing on the scalp above her left ear. Worried our parents would blame her curling iron for it, and confiscate the device, she resorted to calling me instead. She had what docs call Alopecia areata apparently a common condition, affecting over a million people in India. Hair falls in patches — generally, from the scalp — and in more severe cases, eyelashes, and eyebrows. “Though the exact reason for it is not established, the main postulated theory is that it is a specific type of autoimmune disease,” says Chennai dermatologist Dr Deepika Lunawat. Which essentially means that the body’s immune system starts acting against its own hair follicles, resulting in hair loss. “It is a polygenic (caused by multiple genes) disorder. Studies have shown that environmental factors such as high stress levels, low amounts of zinc and iron in the body, trigger the condition in an individual who is already genetically susceptible,” she says. If people in your family have had it as well, or if you have other autoimmune conditions, you are more likely to get it. “There is no complete cure for alopecia areata, but there are medications available to curtail the disease activity,” she says. “Topicals such as corticosteroids, when applied on the affected patchy areas, decrease inflammation, and encourage hair growth.” The other option, said the doctor, is immunotherapy and phototherapy. Oral medications are available as well, but doctors don’t often prescribe them, especially in teenagers, as it can affect growth. “If topical therapy isn’t responding, I would prefer intralesional corticosteroids over oral: you inject the medication into the patches, so that the effect is more concentrated,” she says. Despite the emotional or psychological toll of hair loss, the good news is that it is mostly cosmetic in nature, and not symptomatic of any underlying issues. You can expect your hair to return within two to six months. In this column, we demystify the buzzwords in wellness.

My contribution is significant|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|I was cast in a small role, in a theatrical production, recently. While the role was small, I believed it was important. Yet, when I got off the stage after our first performance, I asked myself if my role was required at all. Such thoughts that coursed through me made me feel less of who I was and I slipped into despondency. Feeling unimportant did not help, so I re-examined the role I had played. A concept that I learnt in college helped me process my thoughts. ‘Hygiene factor’, is the belief that the presence of a factor, trait or what have you may not add materially to enhancing value, yet its absence will certainly diminish the effect. In applying this thought to my predicament, I realised that while the role I played may not have added much body to the scene I acted in, yet without it, the scene I was cast to act in would have lacked depth. My appearance in the role provided context for effective enactment by the protagonist. The thought was very enabling and restored me, thus reducing my feeling unimportant. In my not being or wanting to see merit in what I was commissioned to do, I seemed to sabotage myself. As a young adult, I was once told ‘what you do unto yourself, you do to others’; if therefore I cannot appreciate myself, I may not be able to appreciate others. Small or otherwise, my contribution was important. Not acknowledging this to self only causes pain, disappointment and sadness in me. The writer is an organisational and behavioural consultant.

Nature-based is the new organic|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The word organic conjures up images of women with arched, minimally-plucked eyebrows, wearing linen pants (that takes an army to wash and iron), shopping for produce, with wicker baskets. Organic today is associated with everything it should not be: exclusive, expensive, and certification-driven. It’s the sort of thing us city-slickers ‘indulge’ in, when we’re out picturing happy farmers scattering seeds (also from wicker baskets) in sunny climes. Hell, it’s the Indian version of terroir that we imagine artisanal carrots come from. This is just one of the reasons environmentalists, agriculturalists, and nutritionists are now talking about nature-based. Nature is easy to understand. It’s the sun, the earth, water, sans the frills, because it’s also about bees, earthworms, and red ants — yes, the kind that bite. Where organic has become a bunch of products, nature-based is not just about what we eat or wear or put on our faces. It is about preserving and restoring the earth and everything on it — including us human beings and our health. It’s a broad term that includes everyone — scientists and the wicker-basket-toting auntie (me). It’s also easy to understand. For instance, each time I walk into a mall, I can ask myself: ‘Is this nature-based?’ No. Cue to walk out and into a green space. It’s possible to help children role-model the idea. Nature-based means: ‘Let’s all get off our screens and go out and play a game of badminton.’ How would you help a five-year-old child comprehend organic? More than just semantics though, nature-based is a direct reminder that we are losing touch with our natural environment. It helps us notice the trees, bird sounds, even bugs, no matter how concretised our cities. It also helps us reject what is not from Nature: packaged and junk foods, chemical-laden beauty concoctions, fast fashion. What would it really mean if we were to live a nature-based lifestyle in a built-up environment? That we find our way in the world while in sync with Nature, that we build in spaces that Nature has given us, use only what we need, work with it, rather than against it. In real terms, it means saying goodbye to smart buildings, letting the weather cue bodily actions (yes, that siesta in the summer months), eating what Nature gives us (not what ‘big’ agriculture does), wearing clothes to go with the season (goodbye summer jacket). Sadly, the Cult of Organic has pushed us into consumerism of a different kind, turning a good thing into something that can be bought, much like that certification.

Sit up straight...|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Barely two minutes into my interview with Sangeeta Sundaram, one of the few proponents of the Esther Gokhale method for good posture in India, we become extremely aware of how we are sitting. Are our shoulders hunched? Is the spine curved? Is the neck drooping? And that is the main purpose of the Gokhale method, the 43-year-old tells us: “To make you aware of what good posture looks like, so that you can work on bringing it back in your daily life.” Created by Indian-American Esther Gokhale in 1994, the method focusses on restoring the natural alignment of the body, by addressing the root cause of most muscle and joint pain: poor posture. Regaining body wisdom “Nobody is born with an instruction manual on how to use their bodies. We have a kinaesthetic culture, in which we observe each others’ movement patterns and subconsciously mimic it,” says Sangeeta, looking tall in the chair she is sitting in, at Chennai’s Amethyst café. “In the last 100-odd years, as our societies became industrialised, our jobs and lifestyles have changed the way we sit, stand and move,” she says. The Gokhale method, she explains, was formed by observing the postures of people in non-industrialised societies. “It was similar to the postures of children. However, as children grow up, and are made to sit for long hours on school benches — designed for and by adults with poor postures — they lose their body wisdom,” she says. Every bone in the body has a purpose; that is how the human body is structured, explains Sangeeta. Any time the load shifts to muscles that weren’t designed for the purpose, they end up causing pain. “Your original body posture can be brought back, not by force or exercise or training, but by becoming aware of your movement. By noticing how you sit, whether you are lengthening your spine, have your shoulders back, your neck aligned and so on.” As an example, she asks us to roll our shoulders: “Bring your shoulder front, up and back, now let it relax there. Do the same with the other shoulder. This is what your natural position should be like. Simply saying sit up straight won’t work. If you’re conscious about your position, eventually, your bones and muscles will find their way back home.” A lifetime of pain Not everyone who has poor posture has pain issues, but most people with pain issues have poor postures, says Sangeeta. She should know: she was 20 when her back first gave out. After that, pain was a dominant feature in her life. Her work and lifestyle revolved around it. “When you’ve lived with pain for 16 years, you have tried it all… orthopaedic surgeons, physiotherapists, Ayurvedic massages. They all tell you what the treatment should be, but nobody tells you the reason it’s recurring,” she says. In 2012, she took six months off from a high-pressure corporate job, to find a cure once and for all. That’s when she learnt the method from Esther in California, US. “My pain had gone down from being a 7 on an average daily, to 0. I even took up a job that involved travelling and lots of long journeys,” she says. Satisfied, she went to Esther again a year later, this time to train as a teacher.Despite having passed the method down to many students, her pre-teen son still remains impervious to her teachings. “His school and friends are a bigger influence on him than his mother!” she chuckles. To learn more about the Gokhale method, you can reach out to sangeeta@gokhalemethod.com.  Common culprits Gadgets:As they grow smaller and smaller, you tend to become more closed. Your shoulders hunch, neck droops and the spine curves inward, instead of being elongated. Furniture:Most modern furniture is designed so that you sit with your pelvis tucked in. If you had a tail, it would have been under you, instead of behind, like it should be. Vehicles:Car seats are too bucket-y as well. Motorbikes have been modelled after horse saddles, but a horse wouldn’t let you ride if you didn’t sit well, whereas a bike doesn’t give that feedback. Clothing/fashion:Our pants are all too tight, which restrains our waist tilting forward. The fashion industry encourages young girls to thrust their pelvis and bust forward. Footwear:Heels, as we know, push all the weight to the front. Cushioned shoes, on the other hand, don’t give us feedback as to what’s happening on the ground. Not paying attention to how we land affects the knees. We also don’t use our gluteal muscles enough while walking. If we did, we could walk longer without our knees and feet hurting.

Embrace the Essentialist outlook|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|In addition to your usual college course load, you join the debate, drama and quizzing societies. As you are an active member in each one, your days are packed. Though you are already stretching yourself thin, you decide to do a part-time internship at a local startup, after college hours, three days a week. As you hadn’t expected to get the internship when you applied, you now feel compelled to take up the offer. But, as you are loath to forsake any activity, you find yourself on a very tight rope. And, sure enough, you begin to slip up. First, you are late in submitting your record work. Then, unlike your usual stellar accomplishments, your marks on tests are below average. To add to your woes, the head of the quizzing society pulls you up for missing two meetings in a row. When you take part in a debate, your performance is lacklustre. Just when the work at the startup gets interesting, you contract a nasty flu. Being forced to rest in bed gives you a much-needed respite to assess your situation objectively. Prioritise You have taken up an insurmountable load that it is simply not possible to do justice to your commitments. Business consultant and author, Greg McKeown, advocates the less is better principle, and urges you to become what he calls an ‘Essentialist’. He says that if want to succeed, you have to “give yourself permission to stop trying to do it all” so that you “can you make your highest contribution towards the things that really matter.” In other words, you need to evaluate how you are investing your time and energy, and prioritise things that are most significant. By opting to do what is essential and weeding out the rest, you can make a more meaningful contribution. In order to embrace an Essentialist outlook, let go of the notion that can do it all if you simply work harder. If you keep pushing yourself by taking on more, soon enough you will reach breaking point. Besides your work getting slipshod, you will also compromise your health. Instead of aiming to do more, pick and choose what you take on. Given that there is limited time, make judicious choices on how you want to spend your day. To make the most prudent selection, first, be open to all available possibilities. But before committing to an activity or duty, ask yourself if these tasks inspire you. Do they tap your talents or fulfil a need within you? Don’t feel guilty when you eliminate extraneous activities. McKeown exhorts us to switch from the “undisciplined pursuit of more to the disciplined pursuit of less.” Ironically, success can compel you to assume more responsibilities as you feel confident of handling more tasks. But as you assume more duties without necessarily assessing your impact, your efforts may get diluted and you may grow increasingly distracted. McKeown refers to this as the “paradox of success.” So, even when the going is good, be discerning of the choices you make. And, this involves learning to say ‘No’, firmly but politely, to activities or commitments that detract from your most salient goals. Eminent management guru, Peter Drucker, once said in an interview, “People are effective because they say ‘no,’ because they say, ‘this isn’t for me.’” Take stock of your progress and periodically review your objectives, which may change in subtle or profound ways. Being in touch with yourself will help distinguish essential from superfluous goals.

Left, right, centre|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|We had all gathered at a beautiful off-site location for a corporate wellness programme. As I kick-started the session, I asked participants to roll open the mats provided, lay them down in columns, with repeated instructions to leave enough arm space on either side. What followed was not surprising. Mats were laid haphazardly and too close to each other to allow any movement. Everybody’s had to be patiently rearranged. This was just the beginning. During the course of the workshop, we went through several simple exercises, and once again, I witnessed a lack of body and spatial awareness. This isn’t an isolated case. I often see this lack of awareness in people who are comparatively active too. Even minor tweaks that challenge habitual actions — performing an action in reverse order or direction, for instance — seem to leave people movement challenged. It’s usually a case of poor or neglected kinaesthetics. What is that, you ask? An innate sense Kinaesthetics relates to a person’s sensory awareness of the position and movement of various parts of the body — to know where these parts are in relation to each other, in relation to space, and how they move individually and collectively. Kinaesthetic awareness is what contributes quality to movement and makes it more than actions. It forms the basis that helps one know how movement is to be executed and how it feels. Irony of adulthood Ever seen a baby grip a rattle toy with tiny fingers for the first time? The number of times the baby hits it on the face trying to get it into the mouth? A few clumsy but determined tries and then, success! Body and spatial awareness is an innate sense that progressively develops in us humans as we grow into adulthood. Performing relatively more complex movements should then come naturally. Yet, many adults struggle even with simple ones. Reclaiming awareness We need to keep alive and hone our body/spatial awareness to perform movement, especially qualitative ones. This provides physical benefits: fewer stresses, strains and injuries. You’re less likely to trip, for instance. But it also has mental benefits: greater sharpness, awareness, control, and the joy of being able to perform! Body awareness is a powerful quality. It can be empowering and energising. Think of a dancer. A good dancer can leave anyone awestruck by the quality of her/his movements. It’s like watching poetry in motion. The sense of control is strong. None of it is accidental. Use it or lose it Coordination and movement need practice. Practising quick direction changes, manoeuvring simple obstacles, changing/tweaking regular movement patterns periodically, trying new ones and performing composite movements help develop heightened body and spatial awareness. Play games that need mental and physical coordination — such as dodge ball. Being an adult doesn’t mean giving up on fun. Try learning a sport or activity that challenges you in multiple directions. Playing with kids can be a great way of developing skills for all. Balance-building exercises too help develop body awareness. Not everyone has or wants to develop dancer-level skills. But everyone should work on acquiring basic skills of movement and reclaim the power and control that comes with body awareness. Without it we underutilise our superior abilities as humans and do ourselves injustice.

Build people, build business|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|One of the things that farmers in India need to do is -- start looking at themselves as ‘entrepreneurs’, said Venkatesan Ashok, IFS, Consulate General of India, San Francisco at a two-day International Conference on ‘Emerging Scenario in Agribusiness’, organised by Indian Institute of Plantation Management (IPM), Bangalore. Poor farmers, in India, are burdened by input cost, whereas progeny of the big estate owners give no heed to farming. The future of farming in India looks worrisome, if the same continues. Therefore, the farmer needs to think of ways of making his farm activities viable,” explained Venkatesan. In order to withstand market fluctuations, “farmers should possess adequate storage facilities. Innovative cold storage techniques such as heat absorption driven technology that reduces electricity consumption by 85 per cent needs to be explored,” he added. As villages are remote and scattered, dairy farming in India is a challenge as to retain the freshness of milk till it it is delivered. For addressing this grass-root problem, a Ph.D. candidate presented his research on nanotechnology containers that keeps milk at low temperatures. “The apparatus does not consume electricity and can be handled easily by farmers. As milk requires approximately five hours to reach the processing unit from the point of collection in India, this apparatus inhibits the deterioration of milk during this period,” he explained. Solomon Darwin, Executive Director, Garwood Centre for Corporate Innovation, Haas School of Business said: “farming sector needs those who can provide high value at low price. Creation of suitable technology is the need of the hour.” “Building infrastructure does not build smart villages but building people does,” he said referring to the work he has engaged in, in the last few years at Mori, a smart-village in Andhra Pradesh.

Not your usual job|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Deciding what you want to do for a living right after you have graduated from college can be quite daunting. It is common for us to think of our chosen field of study as the only means to a job. But what we do not realise is there are some really unusual, uncommon options out there for us to choose from, and they pay well too! Here are a few options to get you to consider getting off the beaten track... Golf ball diver Are you someone who loves adventure, outdoors, and likes to take risks too? Then, you are a perfect candidate to be a golf ball diver. They are responsible for collecting all the golf balls from the bottom of ponds on golf courses. It may sound easy and fun, but the truth is that along with the balls, be assured to find other stuff too. But that’s what makes it a lucrative choice as according toESPN, golf ball divers can earn up to a $1,00,000 dollars! Furniture tester Imagine a job where all you have to do is simple sit all day. Sounds like fantasy, doesn’t it? As a furniture tester, you will get to do just that! In addition, you do need to give your opinion on how comfortable the experience was. While machines can make the furniture, they cannot judge if humans will enjoy it. And that’s why people are employed to do this. In fact, a variant of this is bed testing where people are hired to test beds — mattresses and pillows, to be specific — for companies and hotels. You are paid to sleep at work! A good bed tester must know how to lie down to check if the mattress has dips and if the edges of the bed are strong enough to sit on. Pet food taster Ever wondered what the food your dog is eating tastes like? As a pet food taster, it will be your job to know. You will have the responsibility of making sure our pets eat clean and good quality food. You will have to taste pet food to evaluate the flavours and check if it is up to quality standards. Nobody deserves bad food, and definitely not the favourite member of the family. Wildlife photographer If you enjoy photography and have a penchant for wildlife, becoming a wildlife photographer is a good idea. Touted to be one of the most challenging forms of photography, you will need to have good skills. While a degree is not mandatory, you must be willing to travel and have a passion for nature. Contributing to travel and environment magazines likeNational Geographicor websites and television channels, can also be a lucrative option. Depending upon your shots, creativity, and sense of timing, you will be offered projects. You can earn anywhere from Rs. 1.25 lakhs to Rs. 2.5 lakhs per month. Horse exerciser Horse exercisers are individuals responsible for riding racehorses during workouts to keep the animals fit and race-ready. They must be skilled at controlling horses and need to be in top form fitness-wise to be able to give the horses a good workout. Being used as race horses, the riders must know the horse’s running rate and plan their workouts accordingly. If you have certification and training you could start with a salary of Rs. 5000 a day.

What’s your narrative?|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Every person has his/her own strengths and weaknesses. Some people are good at learning, some people are better at being practical. There can be no set criteria of selecting students for admissions as there are students who might not score 90% but might be passionate for something other than studying set subjects. In order to be fair to everyone, universities ask for a Statement of Purpose (SoP). It is an essay that a student writes when seeking admission to universities (especially universities abroad). This essay reflects a student’s passion, work experience and the will to put his or her hundred percent in learning. “Many universities follow a holistic assessment process. This would mean, that they would assess the respective student not just on tangible measures like marks obtained in competitive exams like Boards, SAT/ACT, or GMAT/GRE but also measures such as purpose, commitment level, fitment with programme, overall personality, and so on. All of these together are referred to as an applicant’s narrative, profile or story. Application essays are purported to convey the applicant’s story,” says Abhishek Singhal, Co-Founder of UnivAdmitHelp. An SoP gives a student a chance to convince the evaluator that he or she is worth the university’s time, energy and resources. Having read hundreds of SoPs for a single course, an evaluator is trained to catch pre-drafted SoPs and is always looking for something genuine. “Think of it as an opportunity to give a monologue to someone who is interested but tired, kind of like the lecture after the lunch break,” Abhishek explains. Work out the WHYs The essay is considered to be one of the most important part of the admission process. Students should keep in mind that the evaluators are not looking for a mention of one’s educational qualifications and work experiences. They are looking for what did you personally to gain out of those educational degrees and what you learnt while working in the said field. It is important to answer all the ‘why’s like why this university, why this course, why this country. Chalk out your goal for the evaluator and explain briefly how you plan to work towards that goal. “An SoP is all about your independent thinking, experiences and failures, what helped you in becoming who you are today, and not just what you have mastered professionally, but also personally. If you go and venture your time in explaining your academic or professional achievements, it won’t do. It is already there for you to write about in other parts of your application,” says Adarsh Khandelwal, Co-Founder and Director at Collegify. Universities abroad have opened their admission for their 2019 intakes, so, before it is too late, we suggest students prepare their statement of purposes and get ready to prove their candidature.  Chalk out your goal for the evaluator and explain briefly how you plan to work towards that goal.   Quick points to remember while writing an SoP:  Why do you want to study this specific degree? Why do you want to study at this particular college? What do you plan to do with your degree after graduation? Would you choose to end up with a job or take up research?

‘The killing was a turning point for fake news’|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Two decades ago, in the middle of the night, a gang led by Dara Singh, a criminal with links to the Bajrang Dal, a Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) affiliate, set fire to the jeep of Australian Christian missionary Graham Staines, who was asleep with his two sons, Philip and Timothy. The mob was driven by suspicion of conversions undertaken by Graham in rural Odisha. “It was a turning point for fake news,” says filmmaker Aneesh Daniel, who has closely followed the story for the last 19 years. “Everybody was told about the conversions, it became tenfold and he was killed.”  Truth and investigation From then to now, in the era of WhatsApp, the repercussions of fake news has only intensified, lending Daniel’s film,The Least of These: The Graham Staines Story, contemporary relevance. “The forces of fake news today are stronger when they try to divert the attention,” says the 50-year-old filmmaker. But the central theme of the film and its appeal is “forgiveness, hope and love”, as Graham’s wife, Gladys, demonstrated by pardoning the killers, says Daniel. The film chronicles the story of the Staines family through the eyes of an investigative journalist, played by Sharman Joshi, who tries to uncover the truth behind the allegation of religious conversions. In June 1999, the Wadhwa Commission, headed by Justice D.P. Wadhwa of the Supreme Court, found Singh guilty but ruled out the involvement of the Bajrang Dal as there was no evidence to suggest that any of the persons involved in the crime was a member of either the Bajrang Dal or the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). This, despite evidence to show that Dara Singh and his associates were active sympathisers of the two organisations. The Commission itself had acknowledged that Singh was involved in the cow protection movement and had earlier targeted Muslim cattle traders. Senior members of the then ruling BJP government, including George Fernandes and Narendra Modi, supported the findings and attributed the murder to “international conspiracy theories”. Importance of forgiveness However, since Gladys forgave the killers but allowed the law to take its course, the Hyderabad-based filmmaker says he refrained from pointing fingers in his film. He hasn’t either mentioned Singh nor hinted at his affiliation with the Bajrang Dal. “Fundamentalists don’t have a religion but they have their motives,” declares Daniel, who wanted to contain the film to forgiveness and debunking fake news that surrounded the Staines’ family and their work. Interestingly, the film is releasing in at a time when the BJP is in power at the Centre again and up for elections. Does Graham’s story find a renewed relevance? “We started the pre-production of the film in 2014 but we wanted to release it in the U.S. first and it takes time to market a film, that’s how it is now out so close to the elections,” says Daniel. “That is a challenge for us but we have not raised any fingers on anyone.” He believes that had the film released during the UPA rule, they would faced similar apprehensions. “This challenge will be there, irrespective of whatever time it is, because you are standing up and telling the truth,” adds the filmmaker. Then and now Speaking of a timely release, how does the filmmaker draw parallels between the communal tensions two decades ago and today? “Communal tension will prevail even 10 years from now. But the challenge was to come out from all thathungama(noise) and tell the story from the perspective of an investigative journalist,” says Daniel, adding that he didn’t want to glorify the killers by giving them importance in his film. Daniel emphasises thatThe Least of Theseisn’t a Christian faith film either. Although, Stephen Baldwin, a vocal born-again Christian actor, who plays Graham, has previously featured in faith films likeFaith of Our Fathers(2015) andI’m in Love with a Church Girl (2013). “If you categorise it under faith films then it becomes a propaganda film,” explains Daniel. “But the danger is when the faith people start saying that this is my film.” For the filmmaker, Graham belongs to everyone who believes in goodwill, not just Christians. Having started his career in the film industry in 1989, Daniel was sure he wanted to make his feature debut with a true story. A year after Graham was murdered, he met Gladys, who asked him to return a year later. When he met her again, she requested him to write a draft and revisit her. Around 2003, he met his writer, Andrew Matthews and their story got Gladys’ approval, but the project took flight only four years ago. With the intention of reaching out to a wider audience, Daniel chose to tell Graham’s story in English. Released in the States last month, the film, which was out in India on Friday, will travel to South Africa (April 12) and Australia (May 16). “Graham’s story has to be heard far and wide for the element of forgiveness to become stronger,” concludes Daniel.  The challenge was to come out from all thathungama (noise) and tell the story from the perspective of an investigative journalist.

New age policy-makers|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|I still remember the time in school, when civics was the favourite subject for most of my classmates, including me. More than the content of the curriculum that the subject offered, it was the way it was taught, that made it so interesting — ‘participative’ would, indeed, be the word for it. The role plays served as an immersion into real-life scenarios, in order to understand duties, responsibilities and challenges better. The outcome — better understanding, as all of had our thinking caps on. That was not just a momentary outcome, but had a long-term impact of sorts. The interest in the country’s affairs, its societies, communities, and their respective roles was kindred, and enhanced, with the passage of time. Though the profession I chose was far and wide from the subject, the attachment and interest remained. I have always wondered (and hoped) whether ‘learning that encourages to think’ is being actively deployed in classrooms, no matter what age the faculty and students are. One of my recent assignments plunged me into the world of public policy making. The first point that struck me was, “How can someone be trained in this vast and dynamic field?” Of course, basic training forms the core, but experience on-the-job would, ideally, do the trick. The popularity in the study of the field lies in the fact that it holds career progression, wide scope for exposure, and fulfilment of the passion to be the change one wishes to see and make. Having said this, my introduction to the Indian School of Public Policy (ISPP) served as an eye-opener, in a way. Policy-making, and its training, is a highly specialised field, with the amalgamation of theoretical rigour and experiential learning being a prerequisite. Not only is an in-depth study of the nuances of the subject paramount, but what is also vital is an exposure to the subject on an international basis, and to global policy makers. Says Vijay Kelkar, former finance secretary, Chairman of the Thirteenth Finance Commission of India, Padma Vibhushan awardee and chairman of academic advisory council, ISPP, “One of the most important, not skill, but prerequisite for a public policy domain maker, according to me, is the possession of values. He or she should be committed to public good. This is extremely important. On second place, I would place domain knowledge. How can a policy-maker make a policy, on say climate change, when he/she is not well versed with the nuances of the field? This applies to policy-making in any field. On the other hand, this does not mean a standalone focus on one field. It also fosters the strength to navigate between fields, quickly and effectively. Another important prerequisite is the willingness to adapt.” Over the past few decades, it has been heartening to see the paradigm shift towards specialisation in a field like public policy; this has been, mainly, to address the desire in future decision-makers to find innovative and effective solutions for the dynamic challenges the country faces. The energy is infectious and inspiring. At the same time, governments are becoming increasingly open to draw fresh talent, ideas and designs from outside the bureaucratic ranks. The need is urgent and agreed upon. And so, young minds nourishing policy space is an idea whose time has come, and a shift that is here to stay…hopefully, for a long time… The writer is advisor, communications and media outreach, IL&FS Education and Technology Services.

Warehouse of knowledge|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|What is the meaning of ‘not my first rodeo’? (N Bhanu, Hyderabad) First, let us deal with the pronunciation of ‘rodeo’. The ‘rod’ is pronounced like the word ‘road’ and the ‘eo’; sounds like the ‘io’ in ‘radio’. One way of pronouncing the word is ‘ROAD-i-yo’ — with the stress on the first syllable. A rodeo is an event in which people, usually cowboys, get a chance to display their various skills - riding a bull or a horse, wrestling a cow, roping a calf, etc. The people who take part in these rodeos are usually highly skilled and experienced. Therefore, when someone tells you something and you respond by saying, “This is not my first rodeo” or “This ain’t my first rodeo”, what you are suggesting is that this is not the first time you are doing something. You are experienced, and therefore, the other individual need not worry because you know what it is you are doing. The expression is mostly used in informal contexts in American English. Sunil is not at all worried about tomorrow’s presentation. He’s made many before. This is not his first rodeo. Don’t worry. Hema is not going to be nervous. This ain’t her first rodeo. She’s been in several finals before this. What is the difference between ‘godown’ and ‘warehouse’? (K Manjula, Trichy) In terms of meaning, very little. Both words can refer to a relatively large building that can be used to store materials of different kinds. Native speakers of English also use the word ‘warehouse’ to refer to any large store, retail or wholesale, which sells a product at a low price. Although the two words are listed in most dictionaries, all of them suggest that ‘godown’ is mostly limited to eastern Asia; it is most frequently used in India. Some dictionaries define it as ‘Indian English for warehouse’. ‘Godown’ is seldom used in native varieties of English; in fact, most native speakers may not even be aware of its existence. Unlike ‘godown’, the word ‘warehouse’ can be used as a verb as well. Atul’s company specialises in building warehouses/godowns. The students went to a discount electronic warehouse to buy their computer. If you ask me, it makes more sense to warehouse our entire inventory in one place. How is the word ‘behemoth’ pronounced? (Rajesh Trivedi, Jaipur) This rather formal word consists of three syllables. The first ‘e’ sounds like the ‘i’ in ‘sit’, ‘bit’ and ‘kit’; the second sounds like the ‘ee’ in ‘bees’, ‘sees’; and ‘knees’. The final syllable is pronounced like the word ‘moth’. The word is pronounced ‘bi-HEE-moth’ with the stress on the second syllable. According to scholars, the word comes from the Hebrew ‘b’hemah’ meaning ‘beast’. People believe ‘behemoth’ was first used to refer to the hippopotamus. When the word was borrowed into English, it was used to refer to any large animal. With the passage of time, however, the word began to be used with anything that was enormous in size and very powerful. For example, it is very common nowadays to refer to a huge organisation as a behemoth. It’s about time that the auto industry stopped manufacturing such gas guzzling behemoths. If the two companies merge, it’ll result in a behemoth that most industrialists will fear. ******** “Never approach a bull from the front, a horse from the rear or a fool from any direction.”Unknown The author teaches at the English and Foreign Languages University, Hyderabad. upendrankye@gmail.com

GOLD RUSH|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Traditionally, the Gold Coast has long been Australia’s favourite holiday destination. While this stunning city by the sea is still popular among holiday-makers, the significant investment and subsequent growth, over recent years, has seen the Gold Coast emerge as a new-world city. Nowhere has this newfound maturity been more obvious, than within the Gold Coast’s education sector. The city is home to three world-class, research-intensive universities, each providing a unique offering to students. Bond University is privately operated, and sits in the Top 20 Best Small Universities of the World, according to the Times Higher Education rankings. The university is also rated as the number one university in Australia for student experience with five-star ratings, in every student category of the 2018 Good Universities Guide. Popular courses Around 40% of Bond’s population are international students, with the number of Indian students surging over the past three years, on an average increase of 20 per cent, per annum. The most popular courses for Indian students, at Bond University, are business, project management, construction practice and accounting. The university’s new Master of Business Data Analytics (Professional) is expected to be particularly popular with Indian students. The programme began in January, this year, and enrolments from India are already strong. Students first learn technical skills, including the R and Python languages most commonly used in the development of data programming, after which they focus on practical application, based on actual business problems in industries, such as health, marketing and finance. Exposure to expertise In Bond’s trademark small classes, students are mentored by Australia’s leading economists, statisticians, financial analysts and mathematicians, including Professor Steven Stern, custodian of cricket’s Duckworth Lewis Stern (DLS) system for rain-affected matches. “Skills in data analytics are in such high demand that it is a popular area for continuing professional development. As the modern world transitions itself to the information age and economy, there is essentially no area of modern business that is free of data-based decision-making, meaning that the most important component of any successful business, regardless of size or industry, will be its ability to mine its modern storehouse of customer and market information into gains, for the company’s efficiency and productivity,” says professor Stern. Griffith University has more than 50,000 students across Queensland, with the Gold Coast hosting its largest campus.

Warehouse of knowledge|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|What is the meaning of ‘not my first rodeo’? (N Bhanu, Hyderabad) First, let us deal with the pronunciation of ‘rodeo’. The ‘rod’ is pronounced like the word ‘road’ and the ‘eo’; sounds like the ‘io’ in ‘radio’. One way of pronouncing the word is ‘ROAD-i-yo’ — with the stress on the first syllable. A rodeo is an event in which people, usually cowboys, get a chance to display their various skills - riding a bull or a horse, wrestling a cow, roping a calf, etc. The people who take part in these rodeos are usually highly skilled and experienced. Therefore, when someone tells you something and you respond by saying, “This is not my first rodeo” or “This ain’t my first rodeo”, what you are suggesting is that this is not the first time you are doing something. You are experienced, and therefore, the other individual need not worry because you know what it is you are doing. The expression is mostly used in informal contexts in American English. Sunil is not at all worried about tomorrow’s presentation. He’s made many before. This is not his first rodeo. Don’t worry. Hema is not going to be nervous. This ain’t her first rodeo. She’s been in several finals before this. What is the difference between ‘godown’ and ‘warehouse’? (K Manjula, Trichy) In terms of meaning, very little. Both words can refer to a relatively large building that can be used to store materials of different kinds. Native speakers of English also use the word ‘warehouse’ to refer to any large store, retail or wholesale, which sells a product at a low price. Although the two words are listed in most dictionaries, all of them suggest that ‘godown’ is mostly limited to eastern Asia; it is most frequently used in India. Some dictionaries define it as ‘Indian English for warehouse’. ‘Godown’ is seldom used in native varieties of English; in fact, most native speakers may not even be aware of its existence. Unlike ‘godown’, the word ‘warehouse’ can be used as a verb as well. Atul’s company specialises in building warehouses/godowns. The students went to a discount electronic warehouse to buy their computer. If you ask me, it makes more sense to warehouse our entire inventory in one place. How is the word ‘behemoth’ pronounced? (Rajesh Trivedi, Jaipur) This rather formal word consists of three syllables. The first ‘e’ sounds like the ‘i’ in ‘sit’, ‘bit’ and ‘kit’; the second sounds like the ‘ee’ in ‘bees’, ‘sees’; and ‘knees’. The final syllable is pronounced like the word ‘moth’. The word is pronounced ‘bi-HEE-moth’ with the stress on the second syllable. According to scholars, the word comes from the Hebrew ‘b’hemah’ meaning ‘beast’. People believe ‘behemoth’ was first used to refer to the hippopotamus. When the word was borrowed into English, it was used to refer to any large animal. With the passage of time, however, the word began to be used with anything that was enormous in size and very powerful. For example, it is very common nowadays to refer to a huge organisation as a behemoth. It’s about time that the auto industry stopped manufacturing such gas guzzling behemoths. If the two companies merge, it’ll result in a behemoth that most industrialists will fear. ******** “Never approach a bull from the front, a horse from the rear or a fool from any direction.”Unknown The author teaches at the English and Foreign Languages University, Hyderabad. upendrankye@gmail.com

New age policy-makers|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|I still remember the time in school, when civics was the favourite subject for most of my classmates, including me. More than the content of the curriculum that the subject offered, it was the way it was taught, that made it so interesting — ‘participative’ would, indeed, be the word for it. The role plays served as an immersion into real-life scenarios, in order to understand duties, responsibilities and challenges better. The outcome — better understanding, as all of had our thinking caps on. That was not just a momentary outcome, but had a long-term impact of sorts. The interest in the country’s affairs, its societies, communities, and their respective roles was kindred, and enhanced, with the passage of time. Though the profession I chose was far and wide from the subject, the attachment and interest remained. I have always wondered (and hoped) whether ‘learning that encourages to think’ is being actively deployed in classrooms, no matter what age the faculty and students are. One of my recent assignments plunged me into the world of public policy making. The first point that struck me was, “How can someone be trained in this vast and dynamic field?” Of course, basic training forms the core, but experience on-the-job would, ideally, do the trick. The popularity in the study of the field lies in the fact that it holds career progression, wide scope for exposure, and fulfilment of the passion to be the change one wishes to see and make. Having said this, my introduction to the Indian School of Public Policy (ISPP) served as an eye-opener, in a way. Policy-making, and its training, is a highly specialised field, with the amalgamation of theoretical rigour and experiential learning being a prerequisite. Not only is an in-depth study of the nuances of the subject paramount, but what is also vital is an exposure to the subject on an international basis, and to global policy makers. Says Vijay Kelkar, former finance secretary, Chairman of the Thirteenth Finance Commission of India, Padma Vibhushan awardee and chairman of academic advisory council, ISPP, “One of the most important, not skill, but prerequisite for a public policy domain maker, according to me, is the possession of values. He or she should be committed to public good. This is extremely important. On second place, I would place domain knowledge. How can a policy-maker make a policy, on say climate change, when he/she is not well versed with the nuances of the field? This applies to policy-making in any field. On the other hand, this does not mean a standalone focus on one field. It also fosters the strength to navigate between fields, quickly and effectively. Another important prerequisite is the willingness to adapt.” Over the past few decades, it has been heartening to see the paradigm shift towards specialisation in a field like public policy; this has been, mainly, to address the desire in future decision-makers to find innovative and effective solutions for the dynamic challenges the country faces. The energy is infectious and inspiring. At the same time, governments are becoming increasingly open to draw fresh talent, ideas and designs from outside the bureaucratic ranks. The need is urgent and agreed upon. And so, young minds nourishing policy space is an idea whose time has come, and a shift that is here to stay…hopefully, for a long time… The writer is advisor, communications and media outreach, IL&FS Education and Technology Services.

GOLD RUSH|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Traditionally, the Gold Coast has long been Australia’s favourite holiday destination. While this stunning city by the sea is still popular among holiday-makers, the significant investment and subsequent growth, over recent years, has seen the Gold Coast emerge as a new-world city. Nowhere has this newfound maturity been more obvious, than within the Gold Coast’s education sector. The city is home to three world-class, research-intensive universities, each providing a unique offering to students. Bond University is privately operated, and sits in the Top 20 Best Small Universities of the World, according to the Times Higher Education rankings. The university is also rated as the number one university in Australia for student experience with five-star ratings, in every student category of the 2018 Good Universities Guide. Popular courses Around 40% of Bond’s population are international students, with the number of Indian students surging over the past three years, on an average increase of 20 per cent, per annum. The most popular courses for Indian students, at Bond University, are business, project management, construction practice and accounting. The university’s new Master of Business Data Analytics (Professional) is expected to be particularly popular with Indian students. The programme began in January, this year, and enrolments from India are already strong. Students first learn technical skills, including the R and Python languages most commonly used in the development of data programming, after which they focus on practical application, based on actual business problems in industries, such as health, marketing and finance. Exposure to expertise In Bond’s trademark small classes, students are mentored by Australia’s leading economists, statisticians, financial analysts and mathematicians, including Professor Steven Stern, custodian of cricket’s Duckworth Lewis Stern (DLS) system for rain-affected matches. “Skills in data analytics are in such high demand that it is a popular area for continuing professional development. As the modern world transitions itself to the information age and economy, there is essentially no area of modern business that is free of data-based decision-making, meaning that the most important component of any successful business, regardless of size or industry, will be its ability to mine its modern storehouse of customer and market information into gains, for the company’s efficiency and productivity,” says professor Stern. Griffith University has more than 50,000 students across Queensland, with the Gold Coast hosting its largest campus. The university ranks in the top two % of universities globally, and is recognised as one of the world’s top young universities.

Silence speaks louder|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Most of us were fascinated with Amitabh Bachchan’s performance in the filmBlack, where he works with a young girl who is sight and hearing impaired. Now he lends his voice to a short filmWhite,directed by Bengaluru-based Manu Nag, which talks about eye donation. The six-minute film, which stars Priyamani and a dog named Rocky, is produced by S Rajashekar and Sijijayadevan is DOP. “I thought about the concept forWhitein 2016. I had also watched many Korean short films and that made me think that this medium has an audience and a massive reach. I decided to write the script ofWhite. I had done a few films with Priyamani and worked with her in Yograj Bhat’s Kannada filmDana Kayonu. I narrated the story to her and she agreed to act in my film. That boosted my confidence.” Next on Manu’s bucket list was to make a film that would “reach people beyond Karnataka. No matter how short my film is, I wanted it to be made in style and launched in a big way. I also wanted it to appeal to all. So, I stuck to a no-dialogue format using only the visual medium to communicate. The only voice you will hear is the voice over,” explains Manu, who shares how Amitabh Bachchan came to be a part ofWhite. “Having him do the voice over is a dream come true. I wanted a voice and a face that would appeal to the nation and thought of Amitabh sir.” The music director ofWhite, Lovv Mehta, who hails from Mumbai, played Santa and made Manu’s dream come true. “Lovv’s friend is close to Mr Bachchan through him I was invited to Mumbai. Mr. Bachchan heard the concept, script and took a copy of it. After 15 days, I received his audio. He had gone to a studio on his own, recorded his voice and sent it across. I was bowled over,” beams a happy Manu. He says Bachchan has spoken in Hindi and the film has a social message about eye donation. “When people like him back small projects like mine, the visibility and reachability is immense.” Whitewill be available on Lahari YouTube Channel.

Embrace the Essentialist outlook|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|In addition to your usual college course load, you join the debate, drama and quizzing societies. As you are an active member in each one, your days are packed. Though you are already stretching yourself thin, you decide to do a part-time internship at a local startup, after college hours, three days a week. As you hadn’t expected to get the internship when you applied, you now feel compelled to take up the offer. But, as you are loath to forsake any activity, you find yourself on a very tight rope. And, sure enough, you begin to slip up. First, you are late in submitting your record work. Then, unlike your usual stellar accomplishments, your marks on tests are below average. To add to your woes, the head of the quizzing society pulls you up for missing two meetings in a row. When you take part in a debate, your performance is lacklustre. Just when the work at the startup gets interesting, you contract a nasty flu. Being forced to rest in bed gives you a much-needed respite to assess your situation objectively. Prioritise You have taken up an insurmountable load that it is simply not possible to do justice to your commitments. Business consultant and author, Greg McKeown, advocates the less is better principle, and urges you to become what he calls an ‘Essentialist’. He says that if want to succeed, you have to “give yourself permission to stop trying to do it all” so that you “can you make your highest contribution towards the things that really matter.” In other words, you need to evaluate how you are investing your time and energy, and prioritise things that are most significant. By opting to do what is essential and weeding out the rest, you can make a more meaningful contribution. In order to embrace an Essentialist outlook, let go of the notion that can do it all if you simply work harder. If you keep pushing yourself by taking on more, soon enough you will reach breaking point. Besides your work getting slipshod, you will also compromise your health. Instead of aiming to do more, pick and choose what you take on. Given that there is limited time, make judicious choices on how you want to spend your day. To make the most prudent selection, first, be open to all available possibilities. But before committing to an activity or duty, ask yourself if these tasks inspire you. Do they tap your talents or fulfil a need within you? Don’t feel guilty when you eliminate extraneous activities. McKeown exhorts us to switch from the “undisciplined pursuit of more to the disciplined pursuit of less.” Ironically, success can compel you to assume more responsibilities as you feel confident of handling more tasks. But as you assume more duties without necessarily assessing your impact, your efforts may get diluted and you may grow increasingly distracted. McKeown refers to this as the “paradox of success.” So, even when the going is good, be discerning of the choices you make. And, this involves learning to say ‘No’, firmly but politely, to activities or commitments that detract from your most salient goals. Eminent management guru, Peter Drucker, once said in an interview, “People are effective because they say ‘no,’ because they say, ‘this isn’t for me.’” Take stock of your progress and periodically review your objectives, which may change in subtle or profound ways. Being in touch with yourself will help distinguish essential from superfluous goals.

Knowledge Quiz|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Q1BBC had a current affairs programme called “Panorama” since 1953, that is still going strong with a prime-time slot. In 1957, their programme consisted of a Swiss family harvesting a popular food item from their family tree. After the programme aired, the BBC received several calls asking for advice on growing their own tree to produce ______. The BBC told them to ‘place a sprig of ______ in tomato sauce and hope for the best.’ At the time, this dish was uncommon in the U.K., and was considered an exotic luxury. So, Britons were unaware of how it was made and from whence it came. This was BBC’s first ever April Fool’s joke, that was made 66 years ago today. What was this exotic food item that Britons thought they could grow? Q2The segment ‘Flight of the _______’ was featured in the opera “The Tale of Tsar Saltan”, written by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. Its composition is intended to evoke the seemingly chaotic and changing flying pattern of a _______. Despite the segment not being an area of focus in the opera, it gained fame because of its usage in pop culture. What is the segment named, given that it closes out an act where a character is turned into an insect, so he can fly away? Q3This university is an international and research-intensive institution located near Rajgir in India. It was set up to emulate the earlier version of the institution, widely considered the greatest of all ancient monasteries, and as the world’s first residential institution that stood for over 800 years. The initial version was likely ransacked and destroyed by the Mamluk dynasty. What is its name, that’s attributed to the abundance of lotus stalks in the area, and would come to mean ‘giver of lotus stalks?’ Q4This genetic hybrid of a female horse (mare) and a male donkey offers the best of both animals. It is less obstinate and more intelligent than a donkey, while it is more patient, hardy, and long-lived than horses. Often referred to as a beast of burden, this animal is mostly used for carrying loads. It was notably used in the Anglo-Afghan wars to carry ammo. Which ‘fantastic beast’ is this? Q5It was invented accidentally by Joseph Priestley in 1767, when he discovered a method to infuse water with carbon dioxide. It is known as sparkling water or carbonated water in many regions. However, in America and non-Commonwealth regions, a different term is used. It comes from the fact that a German town, renowned for its mineral springs holds a genericised trademark for this naturally carbonated water. What is it called? Q6This word comes from Etienne de _______, a French finance minister, who in 1759, was forced to impose severe economic restrictions, and cost-cutting measures upon the French people. Therefore, the word initially meant ‘to do or make something very cheaply.’ Before the advent of photography, this method was the cheapest way of recording a person’s image. It was usually done on a white background, and the person’s likeness would be portrayed by opaque, dark, black ink. (pictured) What is this method/word called?

A leap of faith|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The healthcare industry, one that has vast and ample opportunities, can greatly benefit from the incorporation of technology. This is where the contribution of 28-year-old Gauri Angrish, founder and CEO of Caredose, a New Delhi-based MedTech company, comes in. When Gauri was studying biotechnology, with a focus on cardiac stem cells, at the University of Nottingham in the U.K., her aim was to get into research. At the time of her return to India, however, stem cell research was neither as advanced as she had hoped for, nor was it as interesting. She then decided to expose herself to the business side of healthcare, joining McKinsey & Company in the pharmaceuticals and medical products vertical. “My job involved a lot of interaction with big pharmaceutical manufacturers, so that’s where I realised that the problem of medicine non-adherence exists,” says Gauri. Medicine non-adherence, an unsolved problem in the healthcare industry, is when patients fail to take their prescribed medication due to reasons such as incorrect dosage or instructions, failure to take it at the right time, or take it all together and so on. Having identified this problem, Gauri was unsure of how to solve it. She eventually quit her job to start Caredose in 2016, after running an independent pharmacy which helped her understand the business. Caredose is an innovative system by which regular prescriptions, each dose precisely packaged, can be sent to patients with reminders and instructions on how to take them in the language understood by the patient. If a dose is skipped, alerts are sent to both the patient and the caregiver. It also monitors the daily medicine intake, data used by doctors when checking a patient’s progress. Prescriptions are automatically refilled when they get over. Caredose works with leading names in healthcare including MAX Healthcare, Apollo Hospitals, the World Health Organisation, USAID, and the Central TB Division, Government of India. To build Caredose, Gauri brought together an ideal team of two co-founders. Today, she has earned a spot on the Forbes Asia 30 under 30 for healthcare and science, and is a certified NASDAQ Milestone Maker. Possibilities galore Gauri believes that healthcare is at an exciting period when the line between tradition and innovation is blurring. “I find it exciting,” she says. “It’s so dynamic and it has so many possibilities, that it’s okay to be wherever you are, as long as you keep your mind open.” When considering the jobs in healthcare, Gauri says, “I will be a little biased towards the technology side, because my exposure does lie there.” Biomedical engineering is also something she considers full of opportunity, especially when there is a combination of both medicine and technology. In today’s day and age, data scientists and data analysts have a power of their own, and Gauri would urge people to focus on these areas. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are also making their way through the healthcare sector. Takeaways When asked about the tips for those heading down the start-up route, she says, “One of the most important things is to work with the right people — this goes beyond just the co-founders and extends to all the employees and the team as a whole. It makes a big difference when you share the load and responsibility with one another while having the same values and focus. Secondly,” she continues, “Advisors, mentors and the people around you are important too. People who have a certain level of intelligence tend to believe that they know best. I don’t think that’s right, because we’re all young and we’re learning. It’s important to evolve and get others’ opinions on matters because sometimes they do know better. Lastly, the start-up world can be made to seem extremely glamorous sometimes — one of the things that drive an entrepreneur’s focus away from what he or she is actually supposed to be doing.” Gauri believes that education isn’t limited to being inside universities and classrooms. The experience in McKinsey taught her about the entrepreneurial aspect of things and the discipline needed to create her company. “Real education begins when you just jump,” she says. “In reality, doing ground work actually teaches you what works and what doesn’t,” she signs off.  One of the most important things is to work with the right people. It makes a big difference when you share the load with one another while having the same values and focus. Gauri Angrish  Caredose aims to solve the problem of medicine non-adherence. It is a system that ensures that patients take their medicines exactly as prescribed. The team works with leading names in the healthcare sector.

Nature’s way|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Coimbatore Parenting Network (CPN), a peer support group on Facebook, has over 7,000 members. Swati Jagdish, a group administrator, talks about how discussions around parenting are changing, right from birth. “Parents are exploring alternative schooling methods for their children, people are moving to traditional and organic diets, and the same is happening with birthing,” she says. “We want to go back to Nature.” This is against the background of women gaining authority over their own bodies. The growing awareness on alternative birthing practices is just one of the many reasons why women are opting for natural birthing. There is a lot of information available on social media related to this, that helps women make an informed birth choice. Drawing from experience Swati draws on her own experience: “I was shocked when I was asked to take progesterone suppositories (which are recommended only for someone with a history of miscarriages). That decided it for me, and at 16 weeks, I decided to go to the Birth Village, a natural birthing centre in Kochi. They clarified my doubts and assured me that there was a super-speciality hospital within five kilometres reach in the case of an emergency. Most importantly, they treat an expectant mother with dignity and respect.” Haritha P, who holds ante-natal classes and is a lactation counsellor at her centre Thalir in Madurai, says natural birthing is a normal physiological process that can be achieved without any medical intervention in the case of a healthy woman. “Millions of women, starting with our own great grandmothers have given birth with the help of abai. Now, there are midwives. For my first child, I had to undergo an emergency C-section. For my second child, I came up with a birthing plan from day one, as I was clear about a vaginal birth. At 36 weeks, the hospital ruled out a normal delivery, as my scan report showed that the baby weight wouldn’t allow it. With just two more weeks to go, I convinced my family, and over Skype, consulted with the Birth Village.” Harita did end up having a natural birth. Questioning the system Pregnant women have started asking the right questions and that is driving the change, says Swati. “They are aware of the birth plan that the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends. They also know that they can say no to an epidural or episiotomy. Most hospitals will listen if you start asking questions.” A woman must know her rights, says Haritha. “An expectant mother has the right to give or withhold her consent for anything from an IV drip to an epidural. She has to be aware of the risks, benefits and alternatives that are available. Support and awareness among extended family also matter.” There are a number of informative videos on YouTube that throw light on the subject: the ‘breast crawl’ videos of the WHO and UNICEF highlight the skin-to-skin contact between the newborn and mother that is recommended immediately after birthing. There are helpful books as well. “In Dr Marsden Wagner’s book,Creating Your Birth Plan,theauthor cites the unnecessary reasons recommending C-section births. But there are those doctors like Dr Fatima Poonawala in Bengaluru, who stick to a birth plan and carry out only natural birthing without any interventions,” says Swati, who runs Bond & Beyond, a centre for pregnancy health, lactation and post-partum counselling. A professionaldoulasupports and assists in labour. Anupama Vijay Anand is one. She also conducts ante-natal classes at her centre, Vriksham, Coimbatore. “Doulasact as a bridge between the doctor and to-be parents. I insist the husband be trained too and be a birthing partner.” With the father also establishing a close connect to the child during birthing, it helps him stay connected post-partum too. Durghesh Nandini, who blogs about her natural-birthing experience, says the main difference between hospital birthing and a birth-centre birthing is education. “I opted for lotus birth and delayed the cord cutting for my second child. The umbilical cord is allowed to fall off naturally.”  The other view A midwife-delivery is fine in a hospital environment, but one has to be aware of risks at home, warns gynaecologist Dr Asha Rao, Director, Rao Hospital, Coimbatore. “If there is an emergency, there should be a doctor at hand,” she says. “Home deliveries worked in the olden days as lifestyles were different. Women did a lot of work, bending, sweeping, and squatting. Now, we are not doing as much physical work and the movement of the baby down the birth passage is not that easy,” she says. She adds that complications have increased, with more women having babies in their later years, and the rise in the incidence of lifestyle diseases such as diabetes and PCOD. Dr Rao feels that obstetrics works better under centralised care, where there is a complete support system. “It is a better option that is geared up in case of complications in the mother or the child.”  A bigger heart  A woman’s blood volume increases and her heart grows bigger during pregnancy. This ensures that there is enough oxygenated blood supplied to the foetus.

The artist’s way|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Kavery Poovanna, founder of Chennai-based Wandering Artist, is set to launch Bhuhu, a course that will offer hands-on training in sculpture, weaving and puppetry, etc. — with co-curator Asha Krishnakumar. The team is currently accepting applications for the inaugural batch. “Bhuhu comes under a bigger banner of Corvai,” says Kavery. “The intensive art programme (launching in July) brings together the fivemargas(tracks) that represent the five elements of nature. The fine arts course, Bhuhu, represents Earth, and upcoming courses include music: water (jalamoraapaha), dance: fire (agniorvahni), tradition: wind (vayuorprana) and temple architecture: sky (aakashaorambaram).” The course will have lectures, demonstrations, workshops and field visits led by experienced faculty like Lakshmi Krishnamurthi, of Kalakshetra Foundation’s visual arts department, and textile designer S Venkatesan. Temple architect MS Vassudhev Prajapathi and Bhanumathy of the Pavai Centre of Puppetry, are part of the faculty, which also includes young professionals in the age group of 25-30. Asha says the mix was necessary to ensure everyone’s questions are answered. “Since the courses are open to all — students, homemakers, artists — a varied faculty has it covered,” she says. With many now keen on studying traditional art forms, Kavery is convinced that the course will find takers. “We’ve received calls from staff at government schools, who wanted to equip themselves with this knowledge and then teach the children,” she says. For Asha, however, it is the experience that matters. “There are multiple social media platforms from where you can learn. But I want people to experience art.” The first batch runs from April 6-28 at Wandering Artist, RA Puram, Chennai. Rs. 7,800 for a single module, and Rs. 39,000 for all six.

On a mission...|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|“It feels great. I was very confident on the ramp,” says an excited Laxmi Agarwal, minutes after she walked as a showstopper for a designer who shares her sensibilities. Laxmi Shriali Sood chose her namesake inspired by the Stop Acid Sales movement. “We want to use her message to reach a larger audience.” The acid-attack survivor got the loudest cheers from the audience as she closed Laxmi Shriali Sood’s show, in a Morroccan-inspired lehenga. The Indian Federation for Fashion Development (IFFD) hosted the eleventh season of the fashion week. Excerpts from the conversation. What does fashion mean for you? For me fashion is an avenue to change people’s mindsets. Through this show, we are saying that fashion is inclusive. I am telling people that designer outfits can be worn by women who have been at the receiving end of a crime. So we are changing mindsets in a big way. This is very heartening for me. Please see the survivors from a fresh perspective. How do you feel about the movie being made on you? It feels great thatChaapaak, directed by Meghna Gulzar, will see Deepika Padukone playing me on the big screen. When a celebrity of the stature of Deepika accepts such a project, she not only extends support to this cause, but also creates awareness. I am sure she will bring about a huge transformation in the way people perceive survivors. In this biopic, she will speak for all survivors of acid attacks. After watching this film, many survivors will reveal their stories. If more such films from Bollywood are made then people know about the darker side of our society. You were part of the London Fashion Week and this was your third show at India Runway Week. Do you participate in fashion weeks to raise your voice? It helps me to raise my voice on behalf of so many victims. Now the media is supporting me in a big way. This has resulted in heightened awareness and today so many fashion lovers clapped for me when I walked on the ramp. This was my seventh show at a fashion week. How successful have you been as campaigner with Stop Sale Acid? I started this campaign last year. I was told that my one-minute video can change the lives of scores of people. The best part is that it did strike a chord with the masses. Twenty thousand people watched this video. So many shopkeepers stopped selling acid. I would like to take this forward and also try to rope in those running the administration of our country. Laxmi Shriali Sood’s spring-summer line has laser-cut fabrics, three-dimensional hand-crafted embellishments and intricate thread work, fashioned into Indo-Western silhouettes. Available at Shop no. 100, Meharchand Market; lehenga-blouse-jacket sets Rs. 57,000 upwards

Warehouse of knowledge|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|What is the meaning of ‘not my first rodeo’? (N Bhanu, Hyderabad) First, let us deal with the pronunciation of ‘rodeo’. The ‘rod’ is pronounced like the word ‘road’ and the ‘eo’; sounds like the ‘io’ in ‘radio’. One way of pronouncing the word is ‘ROAD-i-yo’ — with the stress on the first syllable. A rodeo is an event in which people, usually cowboys, get a chance to display their various skills - riding a bull or a horse, wrestling a cow, roping a calf, etc. The people who take part in these rodeos are usually highly skilled and experienced. Therefore, when someone tells you something and you respond by saying, “This is not my first rodeo” or “This ain’t my first rodeo”, what you are suggesting is that this is not the first time you are doing something. You are experienced, and therefore, the other individual need not worry because you know what it is you are doing. The expression is mostly used in informal contexts in American English. Sunil is not at all worried about tomorrow’s presentation. He’s made many before. This is not his first rodeo. Don’t worry. Hema is not going to be nervous. This ain’t her first rodeo. She’s been in several finals before this. What is the difference between ‘godown’ and ‘warehouse’? (K Manjula, Trichy) In terms of meaning, very little. Both words can refer to a relatively large building that can be used to store materials of different kinds. Native speakers of English also use the word ‘warehouse’ to refer to any large store, retail or wholesale, which sells a product at a low price. Although the two words are listed in most dictionaries, all of them suggest that ‘godown’ is mostly limited to eastern Asia; it is most frequently used in India. Some dictionaries define it as ‘Indian English for warehouse’. ‘Godown’ is seldom used in native varieties of English; in fact, most native speakers may not even be aware of its existence. Unlike ‘godown’, the word ‘warehouse’ can be used as a verb as well. Atul’s company specialises in building warehouses/godowns. The students went to a discount electronic warehouse to buy their computer. If you ask me, it makes more sense to warehouse our entire inventory in one place. How is the word ‘behemoth’ pronounced? (Rajesh Trivedi, Jaipur) This rather formal word consists of three syllables. The first ‘e’ sounds like the ‘i’ in ‘sit’, ‘bit’ and ‘kit’; the second sounds like the ‘ee’ in ‘bees’, ‘sees’; and ‘knees’. The final syllable is pronounced like the word ‘moth’. The word is pronounced ‘bi-HEE-moth’ with the stress on the second syllable. According to scholars, the word comes from the Hebrew ‘b’hemah’ meaning ‘beast’. People believe ‘behemoth’ was first used to refer to the hippopotamus. When the word was borrowed into English, it was used to refer to any large animal. With the passage of time, however, the word began to be used with anything that was enormous in size and very powerful. For example, it is very common nowadays to refer to a huge organisation as a behemoth. It’s about time that the auto industry stopped manufacturing such gas guzzling behemoths. If the two companies merge, it’ll result in a behemoth that most industrialists will fear. ******** “Never approach a bull from the front, a horse from the rear or a fool from any direction.”Unknown The author teaches at the English and Foreign Languages University, Hyderabad. upendrankye@gmail.com

Space for all things creative|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Hyderabad is now home to India’s first Amar Chitra Katha learning centre – ACK Alive. Spread across 10,000sqft adjacent to Ramanaidu Studios, Jubilee Hills, it’s come up in the space that originally housed a visual effects studio founded by Rana Daggubati a few years before he turned an actor. A collaborative effort between Amar Chitra Katha (ACK), Rana Daggubati and Kishore Biyani of Future Group, this space aims to teach the 64 art forms to children and adults who want to re-discover their creative side. The spacious set-up comes alive with walls in vibrant sunshine hues and decked up with posters of the earliest ACK comics and characters from Tinkle. “The visual effects studio that once existed here was an adult, corporate space. We turned it around to a space that would welcome children and make them want to spend time here,” Rana tells us. Creative corners Art director Bhupesh who’s worked with film productions and the creative team of ACK got together and roped in several artists, including Hyderabad-based art therapist Saher Ali to adorn the learning centre with statuettes, murals, paintings, a feedback tree and adarzicorner to display products created by participants. “It felt like we were sculpting the entire space, designing each wall and seeing each corner come alive with many artefacts. You can’t register everything here in one visit; each time you step in you will notice something new,” says Bhupesh. The rooms are creatively named too. At Chitralekha, learn folk arts from rural artisans who’ve honed the skills over generations. Anant Pai room is where you do a theatre workshop or stage a play; the Shantala art room is for the older audience to learn painting; at the Amrapali studio learn Bharatanatyam, Kuchipudi, Bollywood dance and even acrobatic yoga! The music room is called Tansen and under the Parijata tree, learn pottery and woodwork. There’s also a mini library. If you’re in a group, gather at a storytelling corner and allow your imagination to soar. The idea of ACK Alive stemmed around seven months ago, says Vidisha Bagree, director, ACK. Rana who was in touch with the Biyanis for an ad project was keen on starting the learning centre in Hyderabad. Rana explains, “Real estate is easier here and our studio is nearby to help. To me, this felt the right thing to do. Learning has become so boxed. I wanted a place where you can learn, create and tutor at the same time. We have to nurture art and being in the film community, I felt the need to do it. It’s our attempt to nurture a creative community.” Art, a way of life Rana looks at ACK Alive as a creative knowledge hub for all age groups. “There’s enough room here to learn an art form and become a professional. It’s not time pass. Art makes young people look at the world differently. Art is a way of my life and it’s a great way to be,” Rana adds. In the last few days, select guests have been invited to experience the space and give their feedback. Regular sessions are now on for a range of courses. Anuraag Agarwal, CEO of ACK is keen to open more such learning centres across India. The team worked closely with Avanti Schools Trust to design a curriculum that will befit India. He says, “My five-year-old daughter is more aware of Peppa Pig than some of our Indian stories. It’s not her fault. We need to present our stories in a fun manner in digital platforms as well.” Reading comics is a starting point. A learning centre, he feels, can whet the appetite of children to dive deeper into stories and art forms. Anuraag states that finding teachers for different arts is a challenge. Vidisha points out that on the ACK Alive website, each programme comes with a tutor profile and students can rate and review teachers. Having re-visited Tinkle comics of the 80s from his personal collection recently, Rana tells us, “These books were filled with simple, small stories that were entertaining and taught us values. Our land is full of such stories. The West showcases its culture of a few hundreds of years so well; we have thousands of years of culture and need to be doing a lot more.” For the actor, a venture like ACK Alive may not immediately seem to be in the realm of movies. But, as Rana sums up, “Cinema is the keeper of all arts. In that sense, this venture is very much related to what I do in cinema.” (Look up ackalive.com for the courses offered)  The timeline  Amar Chitra Katha was founded in 1967 and its first comic was Krishna, in 1970. Vasavadataa, in 1972, was ACK’s first Indian classic literature title. The first Tinkle comic was published in 1980. ACK published its set of Mahabharata comics in 1985.

IP College’s grand past|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Alipore House was originally the residence-cum-office of the Commander-in-Chief of the British-Indian Army. In 1932, Indraprastha College for Women moved into the colonial-style building designed by George Wood in the early decades of the 20th century. It shifted there from Chandrawali House in the Civil Lines. Indraprastha (IP) College had started in Chhipiwara, behind the Jama Masjid in the haveli gifted by Rai Balkrishan Das in 1904 for the Indraprastha Girls’ School. In September 2015, Dr. Romila Thapar of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), inaugurated the college archives and museum. They are the repository of the history of the college, which started with just five students in 1924. In 1934-35 the number had risen to 71, thanks to the efforts of the Australian educationalist and theosophist, Leonara G’meiner, who was the first principal of the school and college right from 1904 to her retirement in 1935. It was Lala Jugal Kishore, who was instrumental in acquiring the services of G’meiner. Later his grandson, Narain Prasad, was the manager of the school and college upto his death in February 2016. The principal, Babli Moitra Saraf, strived for years to create the archives and museum. One can see in the archives hoary pictures of Annie Besant, Jawaharlal Nehru and other famous leaders, who visited Alipore House from time to time and recorded their memorable impressions of the first women’s college of the Delhi University. Interestingly, one of the students was Zohra Ansari, daughter of the noted freedom fighter Dr. M. A. Ansari. Among other Muslim girls, who gave up purdah and joined the college was Begum Musharraf, mother of the former Pakistan President. Later, Qurratullain Hailder, the Urdu litterateur and novelist, also studied there briefly. Among the noted visitors in more recent years was Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, who was the guest speaker at the Fourth Annual Public Lecture on 13 December, 2007. No wonder a visit to the college is a rewarding experience. It is made all the more vivid while sitting in the verandah facing an enchanting garden that still breathes of the halcyon days of Alipore House. However that pleasure is denied to the visitor in other historic houses which have tumbled down like Jack and Jill of the nursery rhyme. Linked to Alipore House is the primary girls’ school in Patni Mal-ki-haveli, a landmark in Naiwara, which now houses Suraj Kanya Shikshalaya. The first Suraj Kanya presumably was Surajmukhi, Prithviraj Chauhan’s daughter, for whom the first storey of the Qutub Minar (later built upon by Qutubuddin Aibak and Iltutmish) is believed to have been erected so that she could see the Yamuna at dawn and worship the sun. Now the 350-odd girls studying in this middle school are all considered “Surya Kanyas” and lavished with such love and affection that they never think of leaving it till passing out. Patni Mal was a wealthy merchant of Chandni Chowk, whose two-storied, spacious mansion was later handed over to nearby Indraprastha Girls’ School in 1924 by Lala Jagan Nath for running its primary section from where the foundation was laid for Indraprastha Girls’ College before it moved to Alipora House. The school, reached through Chawari Bazar Chowk via Nai Sarak and Chipiwara, still retains its lovely old-world charm, like the Rajasthani-style balcony and canopy above the main entrance in marble, with intricate designs, pillared rooms and arched verandahs. Now after renovation it is a mixture of the old and new. The courtyard, where once ladies in purdah danced and swung on rope jhoolas at the Teej festivals or celebrated Janmasthami, Diwali (with a 100 earthen lamps) and Holi (when rainbow colours blotted out even the sunlight), is now the place where the students assemble in the morning to welcome the new day with a song, before entering class. And what unique classrooms they have: arched with exquisite dallan-type enclosures that breathe of the 19th century. In one of them was a well, a deep one, from which water was drawn before Delhi got its piped water supply. The cool water of the well was a blessing in the summer months, when there were no refrigerators. In the aftermath of the war in 1857, when a lot of wells in the city had been either poisoned or had corpses of the slain dumped into them, such mansions as this haveli were a real oasis for the thirsty as the wells were hidden inside the living rooms. Now since the wells have lost their utility, the one in an ante-room of the senior classes has been closed, says the principal. She leads me through the classrooms and up a flight of stairs to the roof where too classes are held in newly-built rooms, with a wire mesh to keep out monkeys, which are a real menace. Before the school came to be housed here, there were probably kaua-haknis (women who chased away crows) and men employed to scare monkeys. Standing on the balcony, one imagines the time when husbands, hiding behind their big-Rajasthani-skirted wives, watched the Persian soldiers looking for human fodder for their swords, which were drawn out when the huge one of Nadir Shah was unsheathed at Sonheri Masjid, near the erstwhile Kotwali, opposite the Fountain in 1739. “So long as my sword is out of its scabbard, kill everyone you come across”, were the invader’s words as his soldiers rampaged through Chandni Chowk and entered its gullies. Now what one sees is a long queue of parents waiting for school to give over so that they could escort their children back home in the nearby or far away kuchas. As one descends from the balcony through a narrow staircase that also breathes of old times, one cannot shake off the feeling that after seeing the bloodbaths of the 1739 invasion and the 1857 war, the inmates of this haveli must have hurriedly descended through it to take refuge from the killers who had been let loose in the city. Now, of course, it’s the girls who run down this staircase to rush into the arms of their waiting parents.

Dim some story|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|“How did you eat the spicy cheesy broccoli dim sum?” asked chef Jugal Pradhan. Convinced I was giving a smart reply, I said, ‘I popped it in my mouth with chopsticks’. “That is the incorrect way to have that dim sum, the melted cheese needs to be sucked in first,” he replied. Chef Jugal was in town to oversee the Dim Sum festival at Shankar’s F9. Jugal, a sought-after chef had impressed everyone with a delicate eye-popping presentation of the dim sums. Curried dim sums, spinach seafood roll, roasted cumin and sweet potato gyoza — they were all his specialities. “On the first day of the fest, I had to request guests to stop ordering because the chef was working without a break. Jugal’s dim sums are hard to resist. His love for his work reflects in his food,” says Shankar. When Jugal finally took a break to meet the guests at the table, he was all smiles. “I hope everything is good. I am hard-pressed for time to come out and meet the guests and explain the dim sums. One cannot relish a dish if it is not eaten the right way. That is how I started to enjoy food with my grandmother. I started as her helper as a kid. I was helping with tasting the food for her. That is how I developed my love for cooking,” shares Jugal. Jugal is of the opinion that food tastes best in its simplest form. Dishes should be presented and cooked in a way so that every ingredient used contributes to exciting the taste buds. “Each dish should be able to tell a story of its own,” he says. Born in Darjeeling, his quest to understand and hone the skills of cooking good food took him to Kolkata, to Tangra. “Here I learnt about surreal flavours of Asian cooking, use of different ingredients. After finishing my IIH, I went to work in Goa, and then to Mumbai. In Mumbai, I got work with chef Timi Lu, of Flamingo, a restaurant in Juhu. He was a hands-on chef and beautifully understood what the crowd liked,” he says. His quest to learn more on being a top chef took him to Thailand, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, China, Bhutan, Tibet and Nepal. “In Thailand, I worked at a Pan Asian Kitchen in Chiang Mai, at Nobu in Monte Carlo, Hakkasan and Yauatcha in Mumbai and I must say all that I have learnt are from the masters in these places.” Jugal clarifies that dim sums need not always come in a basket nor do they have to be steamed by default, “Dim sum can be baked, fried or even grilled,” sums up Jugal.

Embrace the Essentialist outlook|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|In addition to your usual college course load, you join the debate, drama and quizzing societies. As you are an active member in each one, your days are packed. Though you are already stretching yourself thin, you decide to do a part-time internship at a local startup, after college hours, three days a week. As you hadn’t expected to get the internship when you applied, you now feel compelled to take up the offer. But, as you are loath to forsake any activity, you find yourself on a very tight rope. And, sure enough, you begin to slip up. First, you are late in submitting your record work. Then, unlike your usual stellar accomplishments, your marks on tests are below average. To add to your woes, the head of the quizzing society pulls you up for missing two meetings in a row. When you take part in a debate, your performance is lacklustre. Just when the work at the startup gets interesting, you contract a nasty flu. Being forced to rest in bed gives you a much-needed respite to assess your situation objectively. Prioritise You have taken up an insurmountable load that it is simply not possible to do justice to your commitments. Business consultant and author, Greg McKeown, advocates the less is better principle, and urges you to become what he calls an ‘Essentialist’. He says that if want to succeed, you have to “give yourself permission to stop trying to do it all” so that you “can you make your highest contribution towards the things that really matter.” In other words, you need to evaluate how you are investing your time and energy, and prioritise things that are most significant. By opting to do what is essential and weeding out the rest, you can make a more meaningful contribution. In order to embrace an Essentialist outlook, let go of the notion that can do it all if you simply work harder. If you keep pushing yourself by taking on more, soon enough you will reach breaking point. Besides your work getting slipshod, you will also compromise your health. Instead of aiming to do more, pick and choose what you take on. Given that there is limited time, make judicious choices on how you want to spend your day. To make the most prudent selection, first, be open to all available possibilities. But before committing to an activity or duty, ask yourself if these tasks inspire you. Do they tap your talents or fulfil a need within you? Don’t feel guilty when you eliminate extraneous activities. McKeown exhorts us to switch from the “undisciplined pursuit of more to the disciplined pursuit of less.” Ironically, success can compel you to assume more responsibilities as you feel confident of handling more tasks. But as you assume more duties without necessarily assessing your impact, your efforts may get diluted and you may grow increasingly distracted. McKeown refers to this as the “paradox of success.” So, even when the going is good, be discerning of the choices you make. And, this involves learning to say ‘No’, firmly but politely, to activities or commitments that detract from your most salient goals. Eminent management guru, Peter Drucker, once said in an interview, “People are effective because they say ‘no,’ because they say, ‘this isn’t for me.’” Take stock of your progress and periodically review your objectives, which may change in subtle or profound ways. Being in touch with yourself will help distinguish essential from superfluous goals.

The book has been penned by eminent journalist and former editor of BBC, Andrew Whitehead. The actor talks about the various role models and influencers he’s met along the way and why one must learn to be proud of the institution you are from, despite its people. From the heart My parents were idealists. We had no money in the family. I had to work my way through college. I was studying History honours at St Stephen’s college in Delhi University. To earn some pocket money, I did commentary for AIR, read English news for television. Later, I even did a show called “Mirror of the world” on television.

People asked me, ‘What will you do with history?’ I was always interested in where we came from. We had some great professors as well. Ameen Sahib, who taught us medieval history, was a phenomenal man. He should have become the principal, given his qualifications. But he couldn’t because of circumstances. It was really unfortunate. A lot of characters I played on screen have been inspired from characters of medieval history. I played Shahjahan and Tuglaq on stage and screen as well. When I moved to Bombay, I worked with a theatre group under Alyque Padamsee. All my training came from acting through stage. You see, I could never become a conventional Bollywood superstar. I just couldn’t sing and dance. I always considered myself more of a dramatic actor, Shakespearean in nature. Acting wasn’t even my first choice. I wanted to be a filmmaker. That’s why I had joined advertising after college, and worked for two big MNCs — Ogilvy and Lintas. I was their film chief for five years. But as fate would have it, Girish Karnad’s first play “Tuglaq” became a major hit and producers came to sign me. I consoled myself saying that I could always come back to filmmaking. I was always inspired by historical greats such as Gandhi and Tolstoy. I wasn’t really moved to acting because of any Bollywood actors. There were no filmmaking schools those days. So I always respect the institutions I came from. I learnt this from my mother. While in Tibet, she was teaching English to monks. But frankly, some of them were absolutely worthless.

Change for the better|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Nidhi Bansal, Pro-Vice Chairperson, Pacific World School, Greater noida The Indian education system needs to focus on encouraging free thinking and creativity, coupled with experiential learning. There is a need for open-book exams that test the application of concepts, leading to fostering creative minds instead of merely the bookworms that the present system produces. This should be followed by regular assessment of teachers, curriculum, and students. Equal attention must be given to non-conventional career paths such as music, drama, fine arts, and sports. Sahil Chhabra, UGFD, Pearl Academy, New delhi The Indian education system needs to focus more on realistic terms; there are subjects which cannot be taught, but can only be learnt by experience. Moreover, the syllabus should be revised and updated constantly. Focus should be on educating students instead of making them cram, in order to top a class of 50. It also needs to be student- friendly, as students will learn only when they are comfortable, and not terrified of their tutors. Veena Goel, Principal, Apeejay School, Pitampura, delhi The Indian education system reveres theguru. In ancient times, the teacher was believed to provide all the answers, and his/her word was the law. The reverence of theguruis still intact, but today,learners and theguruseek answers together. Western education is more practical, application-based and has more room for creativity. This approach, if woven into the Indian system, will make it unparalleled globally. Tushar Arora, X, Guru Harikrishan Public School, New delhi We must change our education style and overall education scenario. No one is going to interview us with a list of questions on what we studied in school. When we talk about changing the system, we must bring technology in focus. Online learning is fast developing; eventually, western education is successful because of better system of management.  Focus should be on educating students instead of making them cram.Sahil Chhabra

Alopecia areata|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Last week, the sister noticed a small patch of hair missing on the scalp above her left ear. Worried our parents would blame her curling iron for it, and confiscate the device, she resorted to calling me instead. She had what docs call Alopecia areata apparently a common condition, affecting over a million people in India. Hair falls in patches — generally, from the scalp — and in more severe cases, eyelashes, and eyebrows. “Though the exact reason for it is not established, the main postulated theory is that it is a specific type of autoimmune disease,” says Chennai dermatologist Dr Deepika Lunawat. Which essentially means that the body’s immune system starts acting against its own hair follicles, resulting in hair loss. “It is a polygenic (caused by multiple genes) disorder. Studies have shown that environmental factors such as high stress levels, low amounts of zinc and iron in the body, trigger the condition in an individual who is already genetically susceptible,” she says. If people in your family have had it as well, or if you have other autoimmune conditions, you are more likely to get it. “There is no complete cure for alopecia areata, but there are medications available to curtail the disease activity,” she says. “Topicals such as corticosteroids, when applied on the affected patchy areas, decrease inflammation, and encourage hair growth.” The other option, said the doctor, is immunotherapy and phototherapy. Oral medications are available as well, but doctors don’t often prescribe them, especially in teenagers, as it can affect growth. “If topical therapy isn’t responding, I would prefer intralesional corticosteroids over oral: you inject the medication into the patches, so that the effect is more concentrated,” she says. Despite the emotional or psychological toll of hair loss, the good news is that it is mostly cosmetic in nature, and not symptomatic of any underlying issues. You can expect your hair to return within two to six months. In this column, we demystify the buzzwords in wellness.

Script to screen and everything in between|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|“I always wanted to make a fun movie likeDie Hard.That has been the driving force,” says film and commercial producer Nikil Shyam Sunder, who’s currently shooting for his forthcoming production. Following the footsteps of his dad, Nikil joined engineering in an attempt to “play it safe”. “But soon, I realised that it wasn’t working out,” he says.  After taking up a couple of odd jobs including news anchoring, Nikil enrolled for a 11-month production course at New York Film Academy in Los Angeles. Since then, he has produced and worked on feature films commercial and musical videos. What’s the major difference between the mediums? “Shooting a commercial film is relatively easy because you can complete the project in a week’s time. So, handling the budget is much more easier. For a feature film, you are shooting for a longer period, right? There are days when things might go for a toss. Which is why we come up with a specific plan during the preproduction stage and keep an eye on the budget.” According to Nikhil, an ideal production manager is the someone who has “patience and the ability to think on his/her feet”. “The producer takes the major decisions and production managers execute his/her ideas.” Does it mean that production managers aren’t allowed to take creative decisions? “Yes, they are. My job is to understand the director’s vision. Sometimes, the director will have grand ideas,” he laughs, adding, “I need to make sure that it’s all executable. The speciality of production manager is to make a low-budget movie appear like a spectacle.” Nikhil says he would love to work in Indian films though, he admits that he has a lot of catching up to do. “To be honest, I stopped following Indian cinema after I left India. Having said that, I follow the works of Mani Ratnam and Anurag Kashyapbecause they are the ones who are consistently making great stories.” Despite his work schedule, Nikil takes time out to watch a Rajinikanth or Kamal Haasan film, if it releases in the US. “A couple of days ago, I watchedBaashaand, yes, it stands the test of time. The last Indian film I saw wasThe Ghazi Attack.It’s really hard to keep track of Indian cinema.” Earlier this year, Nikil produced a couple of videos for musical bands such as Panic! At The Disco and Khaalid. He producedSpiral Farm, which was screened at Sundance Film Festival in 2018. Nikil has also worked closely with a bunch of indie bands and international artists. However, his experience with Lady Gaga was special. “She is the most creative and nicest person I met. I became a bigger fan after I worked with her for G.U.Y. I was very emotional when I watched her performance inA Star Is Born. No wonder she won the Oscar,” says Nikil, adding that he’s currently in the process of making his third feature film. His ultimate goal is to make Ramayana likeThe Lord of The Ringsin terms of the scale. “If I ever accomplish that, I would die a happy man.”  The speciality of production manager is to make a low-budget movie appear like a spectacle

They are the champions|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|It took more than a decade for Ameesha Joshi and Anna Sarkissian, two independent filmmakers from Canada, to document the rise of Indian women boxers. The iconic Mary Kom is the central figure of the documentary,With This Ring, recently uploaded for public viewing on YouTube. A well-researched effort, it also captures the gripping journey of Sarita Devi and Chhoto Loura, champions from Northeast India. “I could only imagine the criticism, even ridicule, these young women must have faced, yet, they were winning medals internationally. They were trailblazers in the truest sense. I admired their strength of character and felt a strong desire to make this film and share their stories around the globe,” says Joshi, on the reason behind picking women boxers as the subject. The film, shot extensively on location in India and overseas, includes some breathtaking training sessions, apart from footage from the competitions. Sarkissian was not even interested in boxing as a sport. “I am fascinated by women’s stories, particularly those that are absent from the mainstream. When I found out about these women, and the unconventional directions they have chosen, I knew they would have interesting stories to share — stories worthy of being made into a documentary,” notes Sarkissian. At the end of the 10-year toil, Joshi is pleased. “There was nothing easy about making this film.” Anna agrees, “We have worked on this project along with our regular paying jobs for more than 10 years. We worked on it in the evenings and on weekends. We had our ups and downs along the way. When you’re in the thick of it, it can feel hopeless and interminable... We had very little funding.” Mary Kom and Sarita Devi have come to symbolise the modern Indian sportswoman — daring in venturing into little-known zones. “It’s been encouraging to observe the significant change in society’s acceptance of women in more ‘masculine’ sports, since we began filming in 2006. I think the power of mainstream movies likeMary KomandDangalhad an impact on changing people’s mindset and are indicators that society is progressing — but I still feel we have a long way to go,” says Joshi. Sarkissian points out the difference between women boxers from India and Canada. “We were quite surprised to see how many resources were being poured into the women’s boxing programme in India, compared with other countries. In Canada, for example, the boxers have no funding. It’s just their hobby. They train at their own gym; they need to find jobs to support themselves, and try to fund-raise to attend competitions. The Indian team has facilities, funding for education, and a generous travel allowance to send a full roster to competitions around the globe. Their Government jobs mean that they have a pension for life, without having to show up for work every day.” Does motherhood promote or impede a sportswoman’s ambitions to venture out? Joshi feels it depends on the attitude of the partner. “Two of our characters, Mary and Sarita, married men that champion their careers. Mary’s husband Onler stayed at home to parent their twin boys, so she could continue to train full-time. Sarita continued to work as hard as ever post the birth of her son.” Sarkissian agrees, “Some people say the busier you are, the more you can accomplish. I would imagine Mary has almost no time for herself! Sarita also has a child, and has managed to keep going. Mary and Sarita both have very supportive husbands who have put their own careers on hold to help their wives fulfil their own ambitions.”

Stories from the c hawl|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Newly-turned producers Madhuri Dixit-Nene and her husband Dr Shriram Nene are holding a series of interviews at Taj Lands End in Mumbai. With the sun setting outside, the two pose for final photographs before returning to more questions about their first production, the recent Netflix release,15 August. Directed by Swapnaneel Jayakar, the two-hour Marathi film is about the dwellers of Gandhichawl. Being lauded for its real, believable characters, the film follows the events that unfold during Independence Day celebrations. Script hunt The couple’s company, RnM (standing for Ram and Madhuri) Moving Pictures was launched in 2012 and has been focussing on health and lifestyle digital content. Shriram says that the “logical sequel” was to produce films by tapping into his business acumen and Madhuri’s experience of 35 years in front of the camera. And for Shriram, the transition from being a physician to partnering with his wife felt like a natural progression. “In that avatar you can cure one patient at a time,” he explains. “This is no different. If you make someone laugh, it’s often the best medicine.” Madhuri took control of sifting through scripts and, after about four years of seeking the right one, she found one that clicked. The star says, “[It was] the wholechawlset-up. I had relatives who lived inchawls, and I [have] stayed with them. So I felt like I know all these earthy, everyday characters. And it’s a layered comedy, so I thought it’d be ideal to make.” Women central Madhuri’s transition comes at a time when there seems to be a wave of female actors taking the reins behind the camera. Anushka Sharma has her production company Clean Slate Films; Deepika Padukone, who is both the lead and co-producer for the upcomingChhapaak, and Priyanka Chopra whose Purple Pebble Pictures is known to promote regional talent and cinema. While they certainly aren’t the first (even actors like Juhi Chawla and Hema Malini forayed into the field over a decade ago) the increasing rise of female actors in the production space seems to indicate a thirst to create and diversify the narratives in Indian films. “How come heroes become producers and nobody asks why? I think when you have worked for 10 to 15 years, you’re equipped to go behind the camera and produce movies,” says the Padma Shri awardee known for 1990s hits such asHum Apke Hain Koun,KhalnayakandBeta. But has the climate become more conducive for this shift? “It was very disorganised before, and that is changing now.” Web battles The tricky part was having to pick between a release in theatres or going online. “This film could’ve done well in theatres,” says Shriram, “because it’s a basic story: a love triangle with different themes. [But] there are 9,000 theatres in India, of which 400 will play Marathi films for a few weeks.” While he elaborates that the Netflix release enables reach to its 139 million paid subscribers across 190 countries, Madhuri adds, “The content is amazing. You see Spanish and French movies, and diverse cultures. For the Indian diaspora abroad, they get to see a Marathi film and it stays on forever!” The conversation soon shifts towards films the couple wish they could have produced. “We have two teenage boys,” says Shriram, before sheepishly adding “So I see a lot of Marvel films, unfortunately. ButBlack Panther(2018) stood out.” Madhuri admits she’s more of a whodunit aficionado and, while she enjoyed last year’sAndhadhun, the actor has barely gotten time to catch recent releases. “I’m just looking at the future and asking, ‘what kind of films do we want to make?’” Shriram agrees, “I think our films should always make people happy, and maybe teach a lesson in the process. But more than anything else, entertain them.” The year ahead The star’s plate is full with Karan Johar’s multi-starrer productionKalank, and Tahira Kashyap’s directorial débutSharmaji Ki Beti. On how she has been balancing her acting and new role as a producer, she says, “It’s been adventurous.15 Augustwas going on, and then I was simultaneously working onKalank.And then I had these two teenagers in the house which is another production! And [there’s also] a little puppy now! It couldn’t be busier, right?” concludes Madhuri, with her characteristically infectious laugh.  How come heroes become producers and nobody asks why?

Knowledge Quiz|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Q1BBC had a current affairs programme called “Panorama” since 1953, that is still going strong with a prime-time slot. In 1957, their programme consisted of a Swiss family harvesting a popular food item from their family tree. After the programme aired, the BBC received several calls asking for advice on growing their own tree to produce ______. The BBC told them to ‘place a sprig of ______ in tomato sauce and hope for the best.’ At the time, this dish was uncommon in the U.K., and was considered an exotic luxury. So, Britons were unaware of how it was made and from whence it came. This was BBC’s first ever April Fool’s joke, that was made 66 years ago today. What was this exotic food item that Britons thought they could grow? Q2The segment ‘Flight of the _______’ was featured in the opera “The Tale of Tsar Saltan”, written by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. Its composition is intended to evoke the seemingly chaotic and changing flying pattern of a _______. Despite the segment not being an area of focus in the opera, it gained fame because of its usage in pop culture. What is the segment named, given that it closes out an act where a character is turned into an insect, so he can fly away? Q3This university is an international and research-intensive institution located near Rajgir in India. It was set up to emulate the earlier version of the institution, widely considered the greatest of all ancient monasteries, and as the world’s first residential institution that stood for over 800 years. The initial version was likely ransacked and destroyed by the Mamluk dynasty. What is its name, that’s attributed to the abundance of lotus stalks in the area, and would come to mean ‘giver of lotus stalks?’ Q4This genetic hybrid of a female horse (mare) and a male donkey offers the best of both animals. It is less obstinate and more intelligent than a donkey, while it is more patient, hardy, and long-lived than horses. Often referred to as a beast of burden, this animal is mostly used for carrying loads. It was notably used in the Anglo-Afghan wars to carry ammo. Which ‘fantastic beast’ is this? Q5It was invented accidentally by Joseph Priestley in 1767, when he discovered a method to infuse water with carbon dioxide. It is known as sparkling water or carbonated water in many regions. However, in America and non-Commonwealth regions, a different term is used. It comes from the fact that a German town, renowned for its mineral springs holds a genericised trademark for this naturally carbonated water. What is it called? Q6This word comes from Etienne de _______, a French finance minister, who in 1759, was forced to impose severe economic restrictions, and cost-cutting measures upon the French people. Therefore, the word initially meant ‘to do or make something very cheaply.’ Before the advent of photography, this method was the cheapest way of recording a person’s image. It was usually done on a white background, and the person’s likeness would be portrayed by opaque, dark, black ink. (pictured) What is this method/word called?

A leap of faith|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The healthcare industry, one that has vast and ample opportunities, can greatly benefit from the incorporation of technology. This is where the contribution of 28-year-old Gauri Angrish, founder and CEO of Caredose, a New Delhi-based MedTech company, comes in. When Gauri was studying biotechnology, with a focus on cardiac stem cells, at the University of Nottingham in the U.K., her aim was to get into research. At the time of her return to India, however, stem cell research was neither as advanced as she had hoped for, nor was it as interesting. She then decided to expose herself to the business side of healthcare, joining McKinsey & Company in the pharmaceuticals and medical products vertical. “My job involved a lot of interaction with big pharmaceutical manufacturers, so that’s where I realised that the problem of medicine non-adherence exists,” says Gauri. Medicine non-adherence, an unsolved problem in the healthcare industry, is when patients fail to take their prescribed medication due to reasons such as incorrect dosage or instructions, failure to take it at the right time, or take it all together and so on. Having identified this problem, Gauri was unsure of how to solve it. She eventually quit her job to start Caredose in 2016, after running an independent pharmacy which helped her understand the business. Caredose is an innovative system by which regular prescriptions, each dose precisely packaged, can be sent to patients with reminders and instructions on how to take them in the language understood by the patient. If a dose is skipped, alerts are sent to both the patient and the caregiver. It also monitors the daily medicine intake, data used by doctors when checking a patient’s progress. Prescriptions are automatically refilled when they get over. Caredose works with leading names in healthcare including MAX Healthcare, Apollo Hospitals, the World Health Organisation, USAID, and the Central TB Division, Government of India. To build Caredose, Gauri brought together an ideal team of two co-founders. Today, she has earned a spot on the Forbes Asia 30 under 30 for healthcare and science, and is a certified NASDAQ Milestone Maker. Possibilities galore Gauri believes that healthcare is at an exciting period when the line between tradition and innovation is blurring. “I find it exciting,” she says. “It’s so dynamic and it has so many possibilities, that it’s okay to be wherever you are, as long as you keep your mind open.” When considering the jobs in healthcare, Gauri says, “I will be a little biased towards the technology side, because my exposure does lie there.” Biomedical engineering is also something she considers full of opportunity, especially when there is a combination of both medicine and technology. In today’s day and age, data scientists and data analysts have a power of their own, and Gauri would urge people to focus on these areas. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are also making their way through the healthcare sector. Takeaways When asked about the tips for those heading down the start-up route, she says, “One of the most important things is to work with the right people — this goes beyond just the co-founders and extends to all the employees and the team as a whole. It makes a big difference when you share the load and responsibility with one another while having the same values and focus. Secondly,” she continues, “Advisors, mentors and the people around you are important too. People who have a certain level of intelligence tend to believe that they know best. I don’t think that’s right, because we’re all young and we’re learning. It’s important to evolve and get others’ opinions on matters because sometimes they do know better. Lastly, the start-up world can be made to seem extremely glamorous sometimes — one of the things that drive an entrepreneur’s focus away from what he or she is actually supposed to be doing.” Gauri believes that education isn’t limited to being inside universities and classrooms. The experience in McKinsey taught her about the entrepreneurial aspect of things and the discipline needed to create her company. “Real education begins when you just jump,” she says. “In reality, doing ground work actually teaches you what works and what doesn’t,” she signs off.  One of the most important things is to work with the right people. It makes a big difference when you share the load with one another while having the same values and focus. Gauri Angrish  Caredose aims to solve the problem of medicine non-adherence. It is a system that ensures that patients take their medicines exactly as prescribed. The team works with leading names in the healthcare sector.
Not your usual job|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Deciding what you want to do for a living right after you have graduated from college can be quite daunting. It is common for us to think of our chosen field of study as the only means to a job. But what we do not realise is there are some really unusual, uncommon options out there for us to choose from, and they pay well too! Here are a few options to get you to consider getting off the beaten track... Golf ball diver Are you someone who loves adventure, outdoors, and likes to take risks too? Then, you are a perfect candidate to be a golf ball diver. They are responsible for collecting all the golf balls from the bottom of ponds on golf courses. It may sound easy and fun, but the truth is that along with the balls, be assured to find other stuff too. But that’s what makes it a lucrative choice as according toESPN, golf ball divers can earn up to a $1,00,000 dollars! Furniture tester Imagine a job where all you have to do is simple sit all day. Sounds like fantasy, doesn’t it? As a furniture tester, you will get to do just that! In addition, you do need to give your opinion on how comfortable the experience was. While machines can make the furniture, they cannot judge if humans will enjoy it. And that’s why people are employed to do this. In fact, a variant of this is bed testing where people are hired to test beds — mattresses and pillows, to be specific — for companies and hotels. You are paid to sleep at work! A good bed tester must know how to lie down to check if the mattress has dips and if the edges of the bed are strong enough to sit on. Pet food taster Ever wondered what the food your dog is eating tastes like? As a pet food taster, it will be your job to know. You will have the responsibility of making sure our pets eat clean and good quality food. You will have to taste pet food to evaluate the flavours and check if it is up to quality standards. Nobody deserves bad food, and definitely not the favourite member of the family. Wildlife photographer If you enjoy photography and have a penchant for wildlife, becoming a wildlife photographer is a good idea. Touted to be one of the most challenging forms of photography, you will need to have good skills. While a degree is not mandatory, you must be willing to travel and have a passion for nature. Contributing to travel and environment magazines likeNational Geographicor websites and television channels, can also be a lucrative option. Depending upon your shots, creativity, and sense of timing, you will be offered projects. You can earn anywhere from Rs. 1.25 lakhs to Rs. 2.5 lakhs per month. Horse exerciser Horse exercisers are individuals responsible for riding racehorses during workouts to keep the animals fit and race-ready. They must be skilled at controlling horses and need to be in top form fitness-wise to be able to give the horses a good workout. Being used as race horses, the riders must know the horse’s running rate and plan their workouts accordingly. If you have certification and training you could start with a salary of Rs. 5000 a day.


Staying ahead|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The School of Management Studies — Sathyabama Institute of Science and Technology, had organised a three day international conference on Advancements in Technology, Business and Management in association with the University of MISKOLC-Hungary last week.

Warehouse of knowledge|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|What is the meaning of ‘not my first rodeo’? (N Bhanu, Hyderabad) First, let us deal with the pronunciation of ‘rodeo’. The ‘rod’ is pronounced like the word ‘road’ and the ‘eo’; sounds like the ‘io’ in ‘radio’. One way of pronouncing the word is ‘ROAD-i-yo’ — with the stress on the first syllable. A rodeo is an event in which people, usually cowboys, get a chance to display their various skills - riding a bull or a horse, wrestling a cow, roping a calf, etc. The people who take part in these rodeos are usually highly skilled and experienced. Therefore, when someone tells you something and you respond by saying, “This is not my first rodeo” or “This ain’t my first rodeo”, what you are suggesting is that this is not the first time you are doing something. You are experienced, and therefore, the other individual need not worry because you know what it is you are doing. The expression is mostly used in informal contexts in American English. Sunil is not at all worried about tomorrow’s presentation. He’s made many before. This is not his first rodeo. Don’t worry. Hema is not going to be nervous. This ain’t her first rodeo. She’s been in several finals before this. What is the difference between ‘godown’ and ‘warehouse’? (K Manjula, Trichy) In terms of meaning, very little. Both words can refer to a relatively large building that can be used to store materials of different kinds. Native speakers of English also use the word ‘warehouse’ to refer to any large store, retail or wholesale, which sells a product at a low price. Although the two words are listed in most dictionaries, all of them suggest that ‘godown’ is mostly limited to eastern Asia; it is most frequently used in India. Some dictionaries define it as ‘Indian English for warehouse’. ‘Godown’ is seldom used in native varieties of English; in fact, most native speakers may not even be aware of its existence. Unlike ‘godown’, the word ‘warehouse’ can be used as a verb as well. Atul’s company specialises in building warehouses/godowns. The students went to a discount electronic warehouse to buy their computer. If you ask me, it makes more sense to warehouse our entire inventory in one place. How is the word ‘behemoth’ pronounced? (Rajesh Trivedi, Jaipur) This rather formal word consists of three syllables. The first ‘e’ sounds like the ‘i’ in ‘sit’, ‘bit’ and ‘kit’; the second sounds like the ‘ee’ in ‘bees’, ‘sees’; and ‘knees’. The final syllable is pronounced like the word ‘moth’. The word is pronounced ‘bi-HEE-moth’ with the stress on the second syllable. According to scholars, the word comes from the Hebrew ‘b’hemah’ meaning ‘beast’. People believe ‘behemoth’ was first used to refer to the hippopotamus. When the word was borrowed into English, it was used to refer to any large animal. With the passage of time, however, the word began to be used with anything that was enormous in size and very powerful. For example, it is very common nowadays to refer to a huge organisation as a behemoth. It’s about time that the auto industry stopped manufacturing such gas guzzling behemoths. If the two companies merge, it’ll result in a behemoth that most industrialists will fear. ******** “Never approach a bull from the front, a horse from the rear or a fool from any direction.”Unknown The author teaches at the English and Foreign Languages University, Hyderabad. upendrankye@gmail.com

New age policy-makers|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|I still remember the time in school, when civics was the favourite subject for most of my classmates, including me. More than the content of the curriculum that the subject offered, it was the way it was taught, that made it so interesting — ‘participative’ would, indeed, be the word for it. The role plays served as an immersion into real-life scenarios, in order to understand duties, responsibilities and challenges better. The outcome — better understanding, as all of had our thinking caps on. That was not just a momentary outcome, but had a long-term impact of sorts. The interest in the country’s affairs, its societies, communities, and their respective roles was kindred, and enhanced, with the passage of time. Though the profession I chose was far and wide from the subject, the attachment and interest remained. I have always wondered (and hoped) whether ‘learning that encourages to think’ is being actively deployed in classrooms, no matter what age the faculty and students are. One of my recent assignments plunged me into the world of public policy making. The first point that struck me was, “How can someone be trained in this vast and dynamic field?” Of course, basic training forms the core, but experience on-the-job would, ideally, do the trick. The popularity in the study of the field lies in the fact that it holds career progression, wide scope for exposure, and fulfilment of the passion to be the change one wishes to see and make. Having said this, my introduction to the Indian School of Public Policy (ISPP) served as an eye-opener, in a way. Policy-making, and its training, is a highly specialised field, with the amalgamation of theoretical rigour and experiential learning being a prerequisite. Not only is an in-depth study of the nuances of the subject paramount, but what is also vital is an exposure to the subject on an international basis, and to global policy makers. Says Vijay Kelkar, former finance secretary, Chairman of the Thirteenth Finance Commission of India, Padma Vibhushan awardee and chairman of academic advisory council, ISPP, “One of the most important, not skill, but prerequisite for a public policy domain maker, according to me, is the possession of values. He or she should be committed to public good. This is extremely important. On second place, I would place domain knowledge. How can a policy-maker make a policy, on say climate change, when he/she is not well versed with the nuances of the field? This applies to policy-making in any field. On the other hand, this does not mean a standalone focus on one field. It also fosters the strength to navigate between fields, quickly and effectively. Another important prerequisite is the willingness to adapt.” Over the past few decades, it has been heartening to see the paradigm shift towards specialisation in a field like public policy; this has been, mainly, to address the desire in future decision-makers to find innovative and effective solutions for the dynamic challenges the country faces. The energy is infectious and inspiring. At the same time, governments are becoming increasingly open to draw fresh talent, ideas and designs from outside the bureaucratic ranks. The need is urgent and agreed upon. And so, young minds nourishing policy space is an idea whose time has come, and a shift that is here to stay…hopefully, for a long time… The writer is advisor, communications and media outreach, IL&FS Education and Technology Services.

They are the champions|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|It took more than a decade for Ameesha Joshi and Anna Sarkissian, two independent filmmakers from Canada, to document the rise of Indian women boxers. The iconic Mary Kom is the central figure of the documentary,With This Ring, recently uploaded for public viewing on YouTube. A well-researched effort, it also captures the gripping journey of Sarita Devi and Chhoto Loura, champions from Northeast India. “I could only imagine the criticism, even ridicule, these young women must have faced, yet, they were winning medals internationally. They were trailblazers in the truest sense. I admired their strength of character and felt a strong desire to make this film and share their stories around the globe,” says Ameesha, on the reason behind picking women boxers as the subject. The film, shot extensively on location in India and overseas, includes some breathtaking training sessions, apart from footage from the competitions. Anna was not even interested in boxing as a sport. “I am fascinated by women’s stories, particularly those that are absent from the mainstream. When I found out about these women, and the unconventional directions they have chosen, I knew they would have interesting stories to share — stories worthy of being made into a documentary,” notes Anna. At the end of the 10-year toil, Ameesha is pleased. “There was nothing easy about making this film.” Anna agrees, “We have worked on this project along with our regular paying jobs for more than 10 years. We worked on it in the evenings and on weekends. We had our ups and downs along the way. When you’re in the thick of it, it can feel hopeless and interminable... We had very little funding.” Mary Kom and Sarita Devi have come to symbolise the modern Indian sportswoman — daring in venturing into little-known zones. “It’s been encouraging to observe the significant change in society’s acceptance of women in more ‘masculine’ sports, since we began filming in 2006. I think the power of mainstream movies likeMary KomandDangalhad an impact on changing people’s mindset and are indicators that society is progressing — but I still feel we have a long way to go,” says Ameesha. Anna points out the difference between women boxers from India and Canada. “We were quite surprised to see how many resources were being poured into the women’s boxing programme in India, compared with other countries. In Canada, for example, the boxers have no funding. It’s just their hobby. They train at their own gym; they need to find jobs to support themselves, and try to fund-raise to attend competitions. The Indian team has facilities, funding for education, and a generous travel allowance to send a full roster to competitions around the globe. Their Government jobs mean that they have a pension for life, without having to show up for work every day.” Does motherhood promote or impede a sportswoman’s ambitions to venture out? Ameesha feels it depends on the attitude of the partner. “Two of our characters, Mary and Sarita, married men that champion their careers. Mary’s husband Onler stayed at home to parent their twin boys, so she could continue to train full-time. Sarita continued to work as hard as ever post the birth of her son.” Anna agrees, “Some people say the busier you are, the more you can accomplish. I would imagine Mary has almost no time for herself! Sarita also has a child, and has managed to keep going. Mary and Sarita both have very supportive husbands who have put their own careers on hold to help their wives fulfil their own ambitions.”

The wellness proposition|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|If you boil wellness down to its basics, it’s fairly uncomplicated: good health for as long as possible. It’s a journey that takes you through life’s ups and downs, with your body and mind reminding you to rest, eat wholesome food, stay active through the day, and laugh a little with family and friends. The in-road The problem is that we’re mostly out of sync with our bodies and minds because of our lifestyles of sitting and screens, and a disconnection from community and Nature. And where there is emptiness, the devil — let’s call him the marketeer — steps in, with a product for every niggling ‘problem’. A generation ago, health communication was often centred around fear-mongering, as in the case of anti-tobacco advertising or even cooking oil. It was a ‘give up the cigarette or else…’, or ‘buy this brand of oil or else…’ line. Today, fear-mongering has been turned on its head, says Vijay Raaghavan, Associate Director — Management Consulting, Healthcare, PwC, Bengaluru. “Communication is tuned to assuage fears we already have. So if I see the product is ‘all-natural’, ‘pollutant-free’, and I’m already worried about a polluted city, it’s pandering to it. But it’s always a set of pleasant-sounding words that are used, like ‘healing’,” he says. What’s changed is the approach to branding and packaging. While companies are spending more on R&D, it’s also true that “they use information from existing health research selectively,” says Dr Senthil Reddi, Additional Professor, Department of Psychiatry, NIMHANS, Bengaluru. The messaging is usually aligned with the socio-economic class that has the most disposable income. Out and about With social-media explosion, peer pressure is at its highest, and now extends through multiple age groups. “Travel to say, Paris and London is passé. It’s got to be to some exotic location,” says Janaki Abraham, Associate Professor, Department of Sociology, University of Delhi. In the same vein, rice gets substituted with quinoa, or whatever grain a celebrity is eating or a social-media influencer is pushing. On their part, influencers need to live (and show) the most authentic life possible. Take Jacqueline Fernandez, Pilates poster girl, who has a stake in Raw Pressery. She must not just lead a healthful life, but also prove she does on social media and at events. “Trust is key, which thanks to a serious trust-deficit in every sphere, is at an all-time low,” says Delhi-based Sanghamitra Chakraborty, who editedPreventionandWomen’s Healthmagazines when they were in the country, and who now editsReader’s Digest. So, Chakraborty,says, people tend to spend money on big brands with science-backed claims, feeling that they can be trusted. Also, she says we’ve simply outsourced our health, turning to dieticians, life coaches, personal trainers, when we all know what we really need to do. What is it about the exotic that lures us? The more complex a product sounds, the more aspirational it is. So out goes the face cream and in come day and night creams, among the arsenal of products you’re supposed to use for healthy skin. Raaghavan cites words that are key: organic, cold-pressed, virgin, gut health, all requiring a great deal of background reading. This makes it exclusive. It signifies you have a certain level of English language comprehension, data access, disposable income. The market calls these better-for-you products. “It’s a licence to charge more,” he says. Above and beyond “In some way, the crisis in health had to lead to this,” says Abraham. “Unfortunately, it’s so linked to money and has become another product that can only be consumed by some.” But that is how it is worldwide. Carol Singh started a cold-pressed juice brand in 2014, called Antidote. At the time, she says people had no awareness around the concept, but they were curious. “Around 2016, there was a bombardment of natural products, beauty products, supplements. Suddenly, brands were jumping on the wellness bandwagon. Now everyone wants to be in this space, know about it, talk about it.” She and co-founder Nadia Singh, felt the dialogue was getting diluted, so they began what they call Vitality Hours, a day-long event which began as an invite-only affair, and is now a platform where they put urban folk in touch with wellness professionals: yoga ‘gurus’, alternative medicine specialists, nutritionists. Next weekend, they’ll do their first two-day event. She’s candid about the fact that products and services in the wellness space are exclusive and more expensive, but also says it’ll trickle down. In a sense, it already has, if we look at the success of Patanjali that Baba Ramdev says will overtake HUL in the next financial year. Whether Patanjali (Saundarya Aloe Vera Gel, Neem Kanti Body Cleanser) or any of HUL’s brands (Dove, Lever Ayush) are actually facilitating wellness is anyone’s guess, but it’s clear there’s a market for them. This spread of wellness into the FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) segment is rooted to linking professionals — either doctors or others from the medical fraternity — with products. Take activated charcoal. Before it became popular in everything from burgers to smoothies, beauty brands used it. One product claim says it: “easily absorbs and lifts away the black impurities and pollution particles”, and “reveals your natural pure-looking white skin,” playing into insecurities at many levels. A recent change “It’s only over the past decade or so that we’ve learnt what the sun protection factor (SPF) is, or what an ‘active ingredient’ in a beauty product is. Beauty brands began moving into the dermat space,” says Chakraborty. Dermatologists also spoke on behalf of companies, much like how dieticians spoke on behalf of say, almond or olive-oil brands. Packaging and labelling for beauty products world-over changed, to be minimalistic, almost medicinal — it was not an indulgence anymore; it was a downright necessity. On the whole though, people don’t see the attention to wellness as bad: it is an awareness, after all. If it makes you happy to wear a hearable rather than a hearing aid, and you can afford to pay for the pop colours, you’ve landed on wellness. For the rest of us, there’s always preventive health.    A generation ago, health communication was often centred on fear-mongering  Tracking consumers In 2012, PwC did one of its earliest reports on the wellness consumer, drawing up a pyramid that traced the development of a consumer from passive to beginner, active, and finally a believer.
What’s your narrative?|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Every person has his/her own strengths and weaknesses. Some people are good at learning, some people are better at being practical. There can be no set criteria of selecting students for admissions as there are students who might not score 90% but might be passionate for something other than studying set subjects. In order to be fair to everyone, universities ask for a Statement of Purpose (SoP). It is an essay that a student writes when seeking admission to universities (especially universities abroad). This essay reflects a student’s passion, work experience and the will to put his or her hundred percent in learning. “Many universities follow a holistic assessment process. This would mean, that they would assess the respective student not just on tangible measures like marks obtained in competitive exams like Boards, SAT/ACT, or GMAT/GRE but also measures such as purpose, commitment level, fitment with programme, overall personality, and so on. All of these together are referred to as an applicant’s narrative, profile or story. Application essays are purported to convey the applicant’s story,” says Abhishek Singhal, Co-Founder of UnivAdmitHelp. An SoP gives a student a chance to convince the evaluator that he or she is worth the university’s time, energy and resources. Having read hundreds of SoPs for a single course, an evaluator is trained to catch pre-drafted SoPs and is always looking for something genuine. “Think of it as an opportunity to give a monologue to someone who is interested but tired, kind of like the lecture after the lunch break,” Abhishek explains. Work out the WHYs The essay is considered to be one of the most important part of the admission process. Students should keep in mind that the evaluators are not looking for a mention of one’s educational qualifications and work experiences. They are looking for what did you personally to gain out of those educational degrees and what you learnt while working in the said field. It is important to answer all the ‘why’s like why this university, why this course, why this country. Chalk out your goal for the evaluator and explain briefly how you plan to work towards that goal. “An SoP is all about your independent thinking, experiences and failures, what helped you in becoming who you are today, and not just what you have mastered professionally, but also personally. If you go and venture your time in explaining your academic or professional achievements, it won’t do. It is already there for you to write about in other parts of your application,” says Adarsh Khandelwal, Co-Founder and Director at Collegify. Universities abroad have opened their admission for their 2019 intakes, so, before it is too late, we suggest students prepare their statement of purposes and get ready to prove their candidature.  Chalk out your goal for the evaluator and explain briefly how you plan to work towards that goal.   Quick points to remember while writing an SoP:  Why do you want to study this specific degree? Why do you want to study at this particular college? What do you plan to do with your degree after graduation? Would you choose to end up with a job or take up research?

What’s your narrative?|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Every person has his/her own strengths and weaknesses. Some people are good at learning, some people are better at being practical. There can be no set criteria of selecting students for admissions as there are students who might not score 90% but might be passionate for something other than studying set subjects. In order to be fair to everyone, universities ask for a Statement of Purpose (SoP). It is an essay that a student writes when seeking admission to universities (especially universities abroad). This essay reflects a student’s passion, work experience and the will to put his or her hundred percent in learning. “Many universities follow a holistic assessment process. This would mean, that they would assess the respective student not just on tangible measures like marks obtained in competitive exams like Boards, SAT/ACT, or GMAT/GRE but also measures such as purpose, commitment level, fitment with programme, overall personality, and so on. All of these together are referred to as an applicant’s narrative, profile or story. Application essays are purported to convey the applicant’s story,” says Abhishek Singhal, Co-Founder of UnivAdmitHelp. An SoP gives a student a chance to convince the evaluator that he or she is worth the university’s time, energy and resources. Having read hundreds of SoPs for a single course, an evaluator is trained to catch pre-drafted SoPs and is always looking for something genuine. “Think of it as an opportunity to give a monologue to someone who is interested but tired, kind of like the lecture after the lunch break,” Abhishek explains. Work out the WHYs The essay is considered to be one of the most important part of the admission process. Students should keep in mind that the evaluators are not looking for a mention of one’s educational qualifications and work experiences. They are looking for what did you personally to gain out of those educational degrees and what you learnt while working in the said field. It is important to answer all the ‘why’s like why this university, why this course, why this country. Chalk out your goal for the evaluator and explain briefly how you plan to work towards that goal. “An SoP is all about your independent thinking, experiences and failures, what helped you in becoming who you are today, and not just what you have mastered professionally, but also personally. If you go and venture your time in explaining your academic or professional achievements, it won’t do. It is already there for you to write about in other parts of your application,” says Adarsh Khandelwal, Co-Founder and Director at Collegify. Universities abroad have opened their admission for their 2019 intakes, so, before it is too late, we suggest students prepare their statement of purposes and get ready to prove their candidature.  Chalk out your goal for the evaluator and explain briefly how you plan to work towards that goal.   Quick points to remember while writing an SoP:  Why do you want to study this specific degree? Why do you want to study at this particular college? What do you plan to do with your degree after graduation? Would you choose to end up with a job or take up research?

Warehouse of knowledge|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|What is the meaning of ‘not my first rodeo’? (N Bhanu, Hyderabad) First, let us deal with the pronunciation of ‘rodeo’. The ‘rod’ is pronounced like the word ‘road’ and the ‘eo’; sounds like the ‘io’ in ‘radio’. One way of pronouncing the word is ‘ROAD-i-yo’ — with the stress on the first syllable. A rodeo is an event in which people, usually cowboys, get a chance to display their various skills - riding a bull or a horse, wrestling a cow, roping a calf, etc. The people who take part in these rodeos are usually highly skilled and experienced. Therefore, when someone tells you something and you respond by saying, “This is not my first rodeo” or “This ain’t my first rodeo”, what you are suggesting is that this is not the first time you are doing something. You are experienced, and therefore, the other individual need not worry because you know what it is you are doing. The expression is mostly used in informal contexts in American English. Sunil is not at all worried about tomorrow’s presentation. He’s made many before. This is not his first rodeo. Don’t worry. Hema is not going to be nervous. This ain’t her first rodeo. She’s been in several finals before this. What is the difference between ‘godown’ and ‘warehouse’? (K Manjula, Trichy) In terms of meaning, very little. Both words can refer to a relatively large building that can be used to store materials of different kinds. Native speakers of English also use the word ‘warehouse’ to refer to any large store, retail or wholesale, which sells a product at a low price. Although the two words are listed in most dictionaries, all of them suggest that ‘godown’ is mostly limited to eastern Asia; it is most frequently used in India. Some dictionaries define it as ‘Indian English for warehouse’. ‘Godown’ is seldom used in native varieties of English; in fact, most native speakers may not even be aware of its existence. Unlike ‘godown’, the word ‘warehouse’ can be used as a verb as well. Atul’s company specialises in building warehouses/godowns. The students went to a discount electronic warehouse to buy their computer. If you ask me, it makes more sense to warehouse our entire inventory in one place. How is the word ‘behemoth’ pronounced? (Rajesh Trivedi, Jaipur) This rather formal word consists of three syllables. The first ‘e’ sounds like the ‘i’ in ‘sit’, ‘bit’ and ‘kit’; the second sounds like the ‘ee’ in ‘bees’, ‘sees’; and ‘knees’. The final syllable is pronounced like the word ‘moth’. The word is pronounced ‘bi-HEE-moth’ with the stress on the second syllable. According to scholars, the word comes from the Hebrew ‘b’hemah’ meaning ‘beast’. People believe ‘behemoth’ was first used to refer to the hippopotamus. When the word was borrowed into English, it was used to refer to any large animal. With the passage of time, however, the word began to be used with anything that was enormous in size and very powerful. For example, it is very common nowadays to refer to a huge organisation as a behemoth. It’s about time that the auto industry stopped manufacturing such gas guzzling behemoths. If the two companies merge, it’ll result in a behemoth that most industrialists will fear. ******** “Never approach a bull from the front, a horse from the rear or a fool from any direction.”Unknown The author teaches at the English and Foreign Languages University, Hyderabad. upendrankye@gmail.com

Left, right, centre|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|We had all gathered at a beautiful off-site location for a corporate wellness programme. As I kick-started the session, I asked participants to roll open the mats provided, lay them down in columns, with repeated instructions to leave enough arm space on either side. What followed was not surprising. Mats were laid haphazardly and too close to each other to allow any movement. Everybody’s had to be patiently rearranged. This was just the beginning. During the course of the workshop, we went through several simple exercises, and once again, I witnessed a lack of body and spatial awareness. This isn’t an isolated case. I often see this lack of awareness in people who are comparatively active too. Even minor tweaks that challenge habitual actions — performing an action in reverse order or direction, for instance — seem to leave people movement challenged. It’s usually a case of poor or neglected kinaesthetics. What is that, you ask? An innate sense Kinaesthetics relates to a person’s sensory awareness of the position and movement of various parts of the body — to know where these parts are in relation to each other, in relation to space, and how they move individually and collectively. Kinaesthetic awareness is what contributes quality to movement and makes it more than actions. It forms the basis that helps one know how movement is to be executed and how it feels. Irony of adulthood Ever seen a baby grip a rattle toy with tiny fingers for the first time? The number of times the baby hits it on the face trying to get it into the mouth? A few clumsy but determined tries and then, success! Body and spatial awareness is an innate sense that progressively develops in us humans as we grow into adulthood. Performing relatively more complex movements should then come naturally. Yet, many adults struggle even with simple ones. Reclaiming awareness We need to keep alive and hone our body/spatial awareness to perform movement, especially qualitative ones. This provides physical benefits: fewer stresses, strains and injuries. You’re less likely to trip, for instance. But it also has mental benefits: greater sharpness, awareness, control, and the joy of being able to perform! Body awareness is a powerful quality. It can be empowering and energising. Think of a dancer. A good dancer can leave anyone awestruck by the quality of her/his movements. It’s like watching poetry in motion. The sense of control is strong. None of it is accidental. Use it or lose it Coordination and movement need practice. Practising quick direction changes, manoeuvring simple obstacles, changing/tweaking regular movement patterns periodically, trying new ones and performing composite movements help develop heightened body and spatial awareness. Play games that need mental and physical coordination — such as dodge ball. Being an adult doesn’t mean giving up on fun. Try learning a sport or activity that challenges you in multiple directions. Playing with kids can be a great way of developing skills for all. Balance-building exercises too help develop body awareness. Not everyone has or wants to develop dancer-level skills. But everyone should work on acquiring basic skills of movement and reclaim the power and control that comes with body awareness. Without it we underutilise our superior abilities as humans and do ourselves injustice.

‘Find the balance’|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Kabir Bedi, an international actor, attended the book launch ofLives of Freda,at Asian College of Journalism, Chennai, where he had a conversation with students about his mother Freda Bedi, a British woman who fought for India’s independence. The book has been penned by eminent journalist and former editor of BBC, Andrew Whitehead. The actor talks about the various role models and influencers he’s met along the way and why one must learn to be proud of the institution you are from, despite its people. From the heart My parents were idealists. We had no money in the family. I had to work my way through college. I was studying History honours at St Stephen’s college in Delhi University. To earn some pocket money, I did commentary for AIR, read English news for television. Later, I even did a show called “Mirror of the world” on television. Remember, those were the earliest days of Indian television. History was one of my favourite subjects and I followed that in my college as well. People asked me, ‘What will you do with history?’ I was always interested in where we came from. We had some great professors as well. Ameen Sahib, who taught us medieval history, was a phenomenal man. He should have become the principal, given his qualifications. But he couldn’t because of circumstances. It was really unfortunate. A lot of characters I played on screen have been inspired from characters of medieval history. I played Shahjahan and Tuglaq on stage and screen as well. When I moved to Bombay, I worked with a theatre group under Alyque Padamsee. All my training came from acting through stage. You see, I could never become a conventional Bollywood superstar. I just couldn’t sing and dance. I always considered myself more of a dramatic actor, Shakespearean in nature. Acting wasn’t even my first choice. I wanted to be a filmmaker. That’s why I had joined advertising after college, and worked for two big MNCs — Ogilvy and Lintas. I was their film chief for five years. But as fate would have it, Girish Karnad’s first play “Tuglaq” became a major hit and producers came to sign me. I consoled myself saying that I could always come back to filmmaking. I was always inspired by historical greats such as Gandhi and Tolstoy. I wasn’t really moved to acting because of any Bollywood actors. There were no filmmaking schools those days. So I always respect the institutions I came from. I learnt this from my mother. While in Tibet, she was teaching English to monks. But frankly, some of them were absolutely worthless. I was extremely angry at my mother for bowing down to them. In reply, she said, “I bow down to the robe, not to the individual”. Always be proud of the institution you are from, despite of its people. I understand the pressure today’s youth faces. The ridiculous practice of judging solely by marks is unfair not only to students but colleges as well. How can you judge someone from the marks they have scored? There are various types of skills! I can only say this: Be clear of what you want to do and why. Don’t search for a ‘lucrative job’; search for a fulfilling one. Search for something that strikes a balance between the two. Second, ask yourself who is going to be the best father or mother to your child. If you get these two right, a major chunk of your problems won’t even exist. As told to Eetika Kapoor  The ridiculous practice of judging solely by marks is unfair not only to students but colleges as well.

War booty and a benefactor|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Hyderabad has a new attraction — the Mir Alam Park on the banks of the lake by the same name in the southern part of the city. The six-acre park at the foothill of Mir Mahmood ki Pahadi perpetuates the name of the nobleman who was a minister of the Nizam Ali Khan. Near Charminar one of the most bustling markets for almost anything is the Mir Alam Mandi. It is a cacophony of noises, smells and colours framed by a graceful arch. And inside the Salar Jung Museum are a bunch of ivory chairs with intricately wrought patterns and shapes that were gifted by the French king Louis XVI to the Mysore ruler Tipu Sultan. The one man who binds all these strands of Hyderabad is Mir Alam Bahadur or Mir Abul Qasim. Mir Abul Qasim was born a few metres away from Charminar in an area known as Irani Gully or as is now popularly known, Burqa Gully. His father hailed from Shustar region of Iran and settled down in Hyderabad. Beginning his career as a vakil to one of Nizam’s courtiers, Mir Abul Qasim came into his own when he led the Nizam’s soldiers to fight Tipu Sultan in 1799. While the Paigah nobles were opposed to aligning with the British to fight Tipu Sultan, Mir Alam had no such qualms. At the battle of Seringapatam as Tipu Sultan’s challenge folded up, a massive share of the spoils came the way of Mir Alam who in turn shared it with the Nizam. But the greed for treasure never ends. If Mir Alam gifted the Nizam some of the spoils of war, the courtiers began whispers about the wealth he had secreted away. Another sticking point for the Nizam was a partition deal agreed by Mir Alam. While the Nizam and the British shared some of the dominions of Tipu, a big chunk of the kingdom of Mysore went to the Wodeyars, the traditional rulers of the land. As the army which defeated Tipu Sultan had been bankrolled by the Nizam, who had also contributed almost half the soldiers for the war, he felt he should have got a more significant share. This heartburn led to a fissure in the relationship between the powerful nobleman and the Nizam. But it is in his role as a benefactor of Hyderabad that Mir Alam is best remembered. He was instrumental in deepening and creating one of the modern wonders of Hyderabad when French engineers built a dam near Mir Mahmood ki Pahadi to create the Mir Alam Tank. Completed in 1806, it was a source of drinking water for the southern part of the city for years. The Mir Alam Mandi too is a gift of the nobleman, as are the ivory chairs, now in the Salar Jung Museum. The legacy of Mir Alam continued when his son-in-law Munir ul Mulk became the key minister in Nizam’s cabinet. Munir ul Mulk’s grandson Mir Turab Ali Khan rose to prominence as the Salar Jung after his appointment in 1853, according toImperial Gazetteer of India. Mir Alam died in 1808 and is buried in Mir Momin ka Daira not very far from Mir Alam Mandi and Mir Alam Tank. With the addition of the Deccan themed park, the legacy of the 18th century nobleman continues to resonate in Hyderabad.   Multi-arch dam The retaining wall of Mir Alam Tank is a brick and masonry structure designed by the same gentleman who executed the construction of the British Residency building. While most dams in and around Hyderabad are built with stone and masonry, the Mir Alam Tank is a rare multi-arch dam built with bricks.

Options aplenty|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|I am a class XII humanities student, who is in the process of writing my board exams in English, Hindi, political science, geography, history, and physical education. I don’t know what I want to do after class XII, as I do not know my field of interest. I am a good listener, I can give good advice, and love reading. Other than that, I don’t know what I want to do. Please guide me about the different fields which are unique. - Divya Shrivastava Dear Divya, I hope you have completed your board exams and finally have some time to breathe and keenly think about your field of interests. Since you are a good listener and can give sound advice and love to read, do you want to consider psychology or law? Both are pretty unique and have brilliant scope. English literature is also a good option. What do you really enjoy? Would you want to teach? Do you see yourself being a therapist, or someone in the advertising world, an event manager? Or do you want to specialise in mass communication, work with a leading business house, or be a journalist? Please meet an equipped career counsellor to help you narrow your search with your interest and skill sets. I am 21 years old and have completed my B.E. in EEE. I got a job through college placements, but wasn’t interested in the software job. My passion was always helping people, so I opted for teaching. During B.E, I took tuitions for school students. Presently, I am working as a math faculty in a private institution, but I want to do something to improve people’s life and for my country. I am the only earning member in my middle-class family. How can I improve my career? - Subha Sri Dear Subha Sri, What else in addition to teaching would you like to do, in order to make a difference? Please shortlist specific areas of interest and skill sets that you would you want to develop (whilst working). Many reputed universities offer online courses, specialised programmes through distant education in social work, public health and administration, counselling psychology and master’s in many disciplines like math, for example. Alternatively, there are also organisations (like Teach For India) that are supportive of young adults and that you can join part-time till you find your calling. You could also join the Indian Army, Navy, or Air Force with your B.E credits, as a direct entry. Think of where you see yourself in the next few years and what makes you wake up effortlessly to be charged and ready for a bright new day; you will find your answer. I am currently pursuing my third year in B.A.(Hons.) English, from Delhi University. I am least interested in pursuing M.A. in literature and am considering an MBA in international business or HR. Is there any scope for me? I have studied science in higher secondary. What should I do? - Tina Shah Dear Tina, MBA in international business is a great choice as you can pursue a career as an international trade specialist, an economist, or specialise in marketing and sales or business development or supply chain, become a risk management director, or even run your own business, eventually. An MBA in human resource management, on the other hand, can equip you with the knowledge and skills that you need to deal with high stress situations and develop talent within an organisation. HR is, by far, the most important department of any organisation. Everything from hiring to firing, and in between, is taken care of by HR. HRM extends great potential for employee and company schemes, recruiting, increasing employee benefits, reworking effective policies, appraisals, designing and engaging in training and development, enhancing job stability and improving overall job satisfaction of the office employees. I am 15 years old and am currently studying in class X. I am passionate about astrophysics, and want to pursue a career in the same. Could you tell me about colleges offering courses in astrophysics (for example, B.Sc Astrophysics), in India, and what are the exams through which I must attempt, in order to get admission to such colleges? - Arjun Sijai Dear Arjun, I am assuming that you are passionate about physics, space, and understanding the physical world. First, you have to complete your 10+2 exam in the science stream, and do exceptionally well in math and physics. After 10+2, you will need to take mandatory entrance exams to make it to the college of your choice. You could do a B.Sc or BS-MS in physics and then complete your Ph.D. in astrophysics from IISc, IISERs, which are good institutes for a degree in physics, and of course, the IITs (engineering physics is a course offered by only a few IITs). You could also do B.E in EEE, ETC, or a course in engineering physics across the IITs, BITS Pilani, IISER Mohali, IIST, or other prominent institutes. All these institutions will give you a good headstart. The rest depends on your discipline and consistency. Disclaimer: This column is not a substitute for long-term therapy.

Complementing the narrative|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Cinematographer Karthik Ghattamaneni is never seen at social gatherings and official functions. He’s uncomfortable when facing a camera but at ease behind one. “I just go to Tirupati after the film wraps up and pray for the success, then I detach myself,” he shares during a chat. His filmChitralahariis set to release on April 12. AfterKrishnarjuna Yuddham, Karthik didn’t take up any project for a long time, as he was committed to work on an untitled project to be directed by Praveen Sattaru. Unfortunately that got shelved after a spade work of six to seven months. He had to give up around six offersfor this project during that time. Creative freedom  Kishore Tirumala’sChitralahariis the kind of cinema happening these days, the kind that works for Karthik. Until then, he had been getting only mass type of films. Commenting on his choice, Karthik states that there is no guarantee that films big in scale will work, but films likeChitralahariirrespective of the result, make him happy. He can contribute to the staging part and there is scope for creative freedom and discussions, as well as enough space and time to take the shots. He has different strategies of camera placements for each director and film. He shares, “For three minutes of footage, you might take 15 or 10 shots but for the same footage in another film, there could be 50 shots and you don’t know if you are doing right or wrong. You can take too many shots if the planning is good. Sometimes for a formula film, on the day of shoot there is discussion happening, content improvisation happens on the spot and shot speed becomes problematic as we wouldn’t be ready. With spontaneous people, the process is different. With such directors around, I do key lighting only when actors starts performing; but in films likeAwe, we did the lighting first and then called the actor for the shot. Each project has a different demand. Spontaneous shoot works with directors who are collaborative.” Karthik comes from Rajiv Menon’s school where he was taught that if cinematography is clearly evident that means you are doing something wrong. If people say it is amazing then you messed it up. If your work supports it, then it becomes an invisible art form. He recalls his past two films and the feedback, “When people said lighting scheme inAwewas amazing, it meant they didn’t watch the film. ForNinnu Korithey said the film is nice and that is because they got connected to the story. After a point they are not seeing cinematography, they are seeing characters and their story.” Karthik adds, “Both camera and story should travel together. Rajiv Menon would say if you are concentrating on photography, why choose films? For films of Sanjay Leela Bhansali, we see grandeur and we expect it, so we can show it on a big scale. When a character is living in a simple house, I don’t believe in elevating the scale.” He reveals directors Sekhar Kammula, Kranti Madhav, Kishore Tirumala are smarter, they don’t come up with their idea of their shot; they talk of content and want cinematographers to contribute. Only when they are not satisfied, do they suggest. They wait for the technician’s contribution, hoping their idea might be better. They value inputs.” SinceChitralahariis about a guy with a lot of failures and his journey, Karthik treated it as a simple film that connects with young audiences. It is peppy, consistent, simple and candid, with a little stylisation through colour. Lot of yellows and blues were used and the art department kept it trendy. It is mostly an indoor film and the mood of the film keeps moving with the character’s mood. Seventy percent shot in Hyderabad and 30% in Mumbai.  For three minutes of footage, you might take 15 or 10 shots but for the same footage in another film, there could be 50 shots

Knowledge Quiz|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Q1BBC had a current affairs programme called “Panorama” since 1953, that is still going strong with a prime-time slot. In 1957, their programme consisted of a Swiss family harvesting a popular food item from their family tree. After the programme aired, the BBC received several calls asking for advice on growing their own tree to produce ______. The BBC told them to ‘place a sprig of ______ in tomato sauce and hope for the best.’ At the time, this dish was uncommon in the U.K., and was considered an exotic luxury. So, Britons were unaware of how it was made and from whence it came. This was BBC’s first ever April Fool’s joke, that was made 66 years ago today. What was this exotic food item that Britons thought they could grow? Q2The segment ‘Flight of the _______’ was featured in the opera “The Tale of Tsar Saltan”, written by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. Its composition is intended to evoke the seemingly chaotic and changing flying pattern of a _______. Despite the segment not being an area of focus in the opera, it gained fame because of its usage in pop culture. What is the segment named, given that it closes out an act where a character is turned into an insect, so he can fly away? Q3This university is an international and research-intensive institution located near Rajgir in India. It was set up to emulate the earlier version of the institution, widely considered the greatest of all ancient monasteries, and as the world’s first residential institution that stood for over 800 years. The initial version was likely ransacked and destroyed by the Mamluk dynasty. What is its name, that’s attributed to the abundance of lotus stalks in the area, and would come to mean ‘giver of lotus stalks?’ Q4This genetic hybrid of a female horse (mare) and a male donkey offers the best of both animals. It is less obstinate and more intelligent than a donkey, while it is more patient, hardy, and long-lived than horses. Often referred to as a beast of burden, this animal is mostly used for carrying loads. It was notably used in the Anglo-Afghan wars to carry ammo. Which ‘fantastic beast’ is this? Q5It was invented accidentally by Joseph Priestley in 1767, when he discovered a method to infuse water with carbon dioxide. It is known as sparkling water or carbonated water in many regions. However, in America and non-Commonwealth regions, a different term is used. It comes from the fact that a German town, renowned for its mineral springs holds a genericised trademark for this naturally carbonated water. What is it called? Q6This word comes from Etienne de _______, a French finance minister, who in 1759, was forced to impose severe economic restrictions, and cost-cutting measures upon the French people. Therefore, the word initially meant ‘to do or make something very cheaply.’ Before the advent of photography, this method was the cheapest way of recording a person’s image.

They are the champions|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|It took more than a decade for Ameesha Joshi and Anna Sarkissian, two independent filmmakers from Canada, to document the rise of Indian women boxers. The iconic Mary Kom is the central figure of the documentary,With This Ring, recently uploaded for public viewing on YouTube. A well-researched effort, it also captures the gripping journey of Sarita Devi and Chhoto Loura, champions from Northeast India. “I could only imagine the criticism, even ridicule, these young women must have faced, yet, they were winning medals internationally. They were trailblazers in the truest sense. I admired their strength of character and felt a strong desire to make this film and share their stories around the globe,” says Ameesha, on the reason behind picking women boxers as the subject. The film, shot extensively on location in India and overseas, includes some breathtaking training sessions, apart from footage from the competitions. Anna was not even interested in boxing as a sport. “I am fascinated by women’s stories, particularly those that are absent from the mainstream. When I found out about these women, and the unconventional directions they have chosen, I knew they would have interesting stories to share — stories worthy of being made into a documentary,” notes Anna. At the end of the 10-year toil, Ameesha is pleased. “There was nothing easy about making this film.” Anna agrees, “We have worked on this project along with our regular paying jobs for more than 10 years. We worked on it in the evenings and on weekends. We had our ups and downs along the way. When you’re in the thick of it, it can feel hopeless and interminable... We had very little funding.” Mary Kom and Sarita Devi have come to symbolise the modern Indian sportswoman — daring in venturing into little-known zones. “It’s been encouraging to observe the significant change in society’s acceptance of women in more ‘masculine’ sports, since we began filming in 2006. I think the power of mainstream movies likeMary KomandDangalhad an impact on changing people’s mindset and are indicators that society is progressing — but I still feel we have a long way to go,” says Ameesha. Anna points out the difference between women boxers from India and Canada. “We were quite surprised to see how many resources were being poured into the women’s boxing programme in India, compared with other countries. In Canada, for example, the boxers have no funding. It’s just their hobby. They train at their own gym; they need to find jobs to support themselves, and try to fund-raise to attend competitions. The Indian team has facilities, funding for education, and a generous travel allowance to send a full roster to competitions around the globe. Their Government jobs mean that they have a pension for life, without having to show up for work every day.” Does motherhood promote or impede a sportswoman’s ambitions to venture out? Ameesha feels it depends on the attitude of the partner. “Two of our characters, Mary and Sarita, married men that champion their careers. Mary’s husband Onler stayed at home to parent their twin boys, so she could continue to train full-time. Sarita continued to work as hard as ever post the birth of her son.” Anna agrees, “Some people say the busier you are, the more you can accomplish. I would imagine Mary has almost no time for herself! Sarita also has a child, and has managed to keep going. Mary and Sarita both have very supportive husbands who have put their own careers on hold to help their wives fulfil their own ambitions.”

‘Find the balance’|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Kabir Bedi, an international actor, attended the book launch ofLives of Freda,at Asian College of Journalism, Chennai, where he had a conversation with students about his mother Freda Bedi, a British woman who fought for India’s independence. The book has been penned by eminent journalist and former editor of BBC, Andrew Whitehead. The actor talks about the various role models and influencers he’s met along the way and why one must learn to be proud of the institution you are from, despite its people. From the heart My parents were idealists. We had no money in the family. I had to work my way through college. I was studying History honours at St Stephen’s college in Delhi University. To earn some pocket money, I did commentary for AIR, read English news for television. Later, I even did a show called “Mirror of the world” on television. Remember, those were the earliest days of Indian television. History was one of my favourite subjects and I followed that in my college as well. People asked me, ‘What will you do with history?’ I was always interested in where we came from. We had some great professors as well. Ameen Sahib, who taught us medieval history, was a phenomenal man. He should have become the principal, given his qualifications. But he couldn’t because of circumstances. It was really unfortunate. A lot of characters I played on screen have been inspired from characters of medieval history. I played Shahjahan and Tuglaq on stage and screen as well. When I moved to Bombay, I worked with a theatre group under Alyque Padamsee. All my training came from acting through stage. You see, I could never become a conventional Bollywood superstar. I just couldn’t sing and dance. I always considered myself more of a dramatic actor, Shakespearean in nature. Acting wasn’t even my first choice. I wanted to be a filmmaker. That’s why I had joined advertising after college, and worked for two big MNCs — Ogilvy and Lintas. I was their film chief for five years. But as fate would have it, Girish Karnad’s first play “Tuglaq” became a major hit and producers came to sign me. I consoled myself saying that I could always come back to filmmaking. I was always inspired by historical greats such as Gandhi and Tolstoy. I wasn’t really moved to acting because of any Bollywood actors. There were no filmmaking schools those days. So I always respect the institutions I came from. I learnt this from my mother. While in Tibet, she was teaching English to monks. But frankly, some of them were absolutely worthless. I was extremely angry at my mother for bowing down to them. In reply, she said, “I bow down to the robe, not to the individual”. Always be proud of the institution you are from, despite of its people. I understand the pressure today’s youth faces. The ridiculous practice of judging solely by marks is unfair not only to students but colleges as well. How can you judge someone from the marks they have scored? There are various types of skills! I can only say this: Be clear of what you want to do and why. Don’t search for a ‘lucrative job’; search for a fulfilling one. Search for something that strikes a balance between the two. Second, ask yourself who is going to be the best father or mother to your child. If you get these two right, a major chunk of your problems won’t even exist. As told to Eetika Kapoor  The ridiculous practice of judging solely by marks is unfair not only to students but colleges as well.


Stand out in the crowd|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Keep these points in mind while creating your resume. CV vs resume When Sachin Tendulkar is invited as the chief guest, he submits a curriculum vitae or CV, but when Sachin Vaikuntham, a graduate, applies for a job he submits a resume (pronounced /rezumay/ and not /rezum/). Although curriculum vitae and resume often get used interchangeably, a curriculum vitae lists a person’s achievements, awards, and honours. A curriculum vitae is two pages or more in length. A resume is used by a job seeker and is never longer than a page. This does not mean using font size 8 to pack in information in one page, but to provide details relevant to a job or organisation. Common mistakes The most common mistake that applicants make is to photocopy and send the same resume to all clients. An effective resume writer puts in the effort to make his/her resume organisation-specific. Such a resume attracts the interviewer. Secondly, ineffective resumes lack structure, focus and headings. Structure gives logical sequence to the information in the resume. Structure contributes to clarity and focus, and reveals an uncluttered mind. Template You could try the following template to structure your resume effectively. Provide all the relevant personal details — name, birth date, correspondence address, email ID, mobile number, date of the resume. Write your job objective highlighting how you can contribute to the organisation’s goals, in a simple, non-exaggerated way in less than 10 words. Qualification: Begin with the last degree first and briefly list your degrees from Class X/XI onwards, name of the college/university, place, and marks. You can use a table to save space and present information in a visually appealing manner. Course and project details: Title, business implications and benefits to the client Skills: Only those relevant to the job Hobbies: Just one or two to bring out an all-rounded personality. If you don’t have hobbies, leave it blank or put in something simple such as listening to film music. But do not fib. A student once mentioned classical music and one of the interviewers turned out to be a classical singer. The student lost the opportunity as he couldn’t answer any question on music.  Checklist Once your resume is ready, check for the following before sending it. Does it: give a true description of your qualifications? match your beliefs? indicate preparation for stated career objective? reflect a realistic time span for fulfilling career goals? If you follow these tips and write an organisation-specific resume with focus and structure, it will stand every chance of being considered an effective resume.

Embrace the Essentialist outlook|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|In addition to your usual college course load, you join the debate, drama and quizzing societies. As you are an active member in each one, your days are packed. Though you are already stretching yourself thin, you decide to do a part-time internship at a local startup, after college hours, three days a week. As you hadn’t expected to get the internship when you applied, you now feel compelled to take up the offer. But, as you are loath to forsake any activity, you find yourself on a very tight rope. And, sure enough, you begin to slip up. First, you are late in submitting your record work. Then, unlike your usual stellar accomplishments, your marks on tests are below average. To add to your woes, the head of the quizzing society pulls you up for missing two meetings in a row. When you take part in a debate, your performance is lacklustre. Just when the work at the startup gets interesting, you contract a nasty flu. Being forced to rest in bed gives you a much-needed respite to assess your situation objectively. Prioritise You have taken up an insurmountable load that it is simply not possible to do justice to your commitments. Business consultant and author, Greg McKeown, advocates the less is better principle, and urges you to become what he calls an ‘Essentialist’. He says that if want to succeed, you have to “give yourself permission to stop trying to do it all” so that you “can you make your highest contribution towards the things that really matter.” In other words, you need to evaluate how you are investing your time and energy, and prioritise things that are most significant. By opting to do what is essential and weeding out the rest, you can make a more meaningful contribution. In order to embrace an Essentialist outlook, let go of the notion that can do it all if you simply work harder. If you keep pushing yourself by taking on more, soon enough you will reach breaking point. Besides your work getting slipshod, you will also compromise your health. Instead of aiming to do more, pick and choose what you take on. Given that there is limited time, make judicious choices on how you want to spend your day. To make the most prudent selection, first, be open to all available possibilities. But before committing to an activity or duty, ask yourself if these tasks inspire you. Do they tap your talents or fulfil a need within you? Don’t feel guilty when you eliminate extraneous activities. McKeown exhorts us to switch from the “undisciplined pursuit of more to the disciplined pursuit of less.” Ironically, success can compel you to assume more responsibilities as you feel confident of handling more tasks. But as you assume more duties without necessarily assessing your impact, your efforts may get diluted and you may grow increasingly distracted. McKeown refers to this as the “paradox of success.” So, even when the going is good, be discerning of the choices you make. And, this involves learning to say ‘No’, firmly but politely, to activities or commitments that detract from your most salient goals. Eminent management guru, Peter Drucker, once said in an interview, “People are effective because they say ‘no,’ because they say, ‘this isn’t for me.’” Take stock of your progress and periodically review your objectives, which may change in subtle or profound ways. Being in touch with yourself will help distinguish essential from superfluous goals.

Not your usual job|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Deciding what you want to do for a living right after you have graduated from college can be quite daunting. It is common for us to think of our chosen field of study as the only means to a job. But what we do not realise is there are some really unusual, uncommon options out there for us to choose from, and they pay well too! Here are a few options to get you to consider getting off the beaten track... Golf ball diver Are you someone who loves adventure, outdoors, and likes to take risks too? Then, you are a perfect candidate to be a golf ball diver. They are responsible for collecting all the golf balls from the bottom of ponds on golf courses. It may sound easy and fun, but the truth is that along with the balls, be assured to find other stuff too. But that’s what makes it a lucrative choice as according toESPN, golf ball divers can earn up to a $1,00,000 dollars! Furniture tester Imagine a job where all you have to do is simple sit all day. Sounds like fantasy, doesn’t it? As a furniture tester, you will get to do just that! In addition, you do need to give your opinion on how comfortable the experience was. While machines can make the furniture, they cannot judge if humans will enjoy it. And that’s why people are employed to do this. In fact, a variant of this is bed testing where people are hired to test beds — mattresses and pillows, to be specific — for companies and hotels. You are paid to sleep at work! A good bed tester must know how to lie down to check if the mattress has dips and if the edges of the bed are strong enough to sit on. Pet food taster Ever wondered what the food your dog is eating tastes like? As a pet food taster, it will be your job to know. You will have the responsibility of making sure our pets eat clean and good quality food. You will have to taste pet food to evaluate the flavours and check if it is up to quality standards. Nobody deserves bad food, and definitely not the favourite member of the family. Wildlife photographer If you enjoy photography and have a penchant for wildlife, becoming a wildlife photographer is a good idea. Touted to be one of the most challenging forms of photography, you will need to have good skills. While a degree is not mandatory, you must be willing to travel and have a passion for nature. Contributing to travel and environment magazines likeNational Geographicor websites and television channels, can also be a lucrative option. Depending upon your shots, creativity, and sense of timing, you will be offered projects. You can earn anywhere from Rs. 1.25 lakhs to Rs. 2.5 lakhs per month. Horse exerciser Horse exercisers are individuals responsible for riding racehorses during workouts to keep the animals fit and race-ready. They must be skilled at controlling horses and need to be in top form fitness-wise to be able to give the horses a good workout. Being used as race horses, the riders must know the horse’s running rate and plan their workouts accordingly. If you have certification and training you could start with a salary of Rs. 5000 a day.

Learn science HANDS-ON|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Handing over a tiny toy, ‘Tippe Top’, H.R. Madhusudan, Assistant Director, Bangalore Association for Science Education (BASE), Jawaharlal Nehru Planetarium (JNP), says he is fascinated by the spinning toy. “It performs like any other rotating object when it is spun on its stem but when it is spun over its head, it turns upside down!” says Madhusudan, as he begins to demonstrate it on his table. When the toy does not flip over as he explained, he quickly realises that it is a defective one and rushes to fetch a working tippe top. “The faulty one also comes handy in explaining kids the science behind toy-making,” says the senior scientist. Madhusudan along with his scientist-colleagues has been designing courses, workshops and shows in physics, chemistry, mathematics and astronomy at the premier Science institution since 1995. This Summer too, BASE offers a variety of short-duration programmes for students from class three to under-graduation. One of their most-sought after courses --Tiny tots-- is for children between class three and five. The aim of this course is to introduce to children methods of science at a very young age through hands-on activities. “Here children are encouraged to think and ask questions about things they come across daily. For instance, why does a ‘Rattleback’, a semi-ellipsoidal toy, prefers to spin in a single direction and refuses to spin in any other direction? When Science is taught in a way that children can relate to, it becomes enjoyable for them,” he explains. Interactions with younger children are kept informal as the idea is to create space that is devoid of stress and competition. “This enables children to share their ideas and findings with their peers without worrying about marks or ranks. This also sows seeds of originality in them,” he adds. Base Camp, a course for students from classes six to ten, will have lectures, accompanied by activities. In this course, high school students are introduced to theoretical thinking. The theme of this year’sSummer Courseis ‘Classification of Things’. “As UNESCO has declared 2019 as the year of Mendeleev’s periodic table, this summer we look at the table closely and also try classifying things, in general, scientifically,” says Madhusudan, on whose table is a coffee cup with the periodic table printed on it. College students are introduced to hot topics of research in all fields of Science inFrom web of Life to the Universe. This course is to demonstrate the joy of research. “Overall, the philosophy of all BASE activities is to inculcate the habit of thinking scientifically,” states Madhusudan. If the Planetarium conducts summer camps in pure sciences and year-long activities in Astronomy, other premier institutions of Science in Bangalore such as Visvesvaraya Industrial and Technological Museum (VITM) offers courses, mainly, in Technology. On an annual membership, it allows students between class six and eleven to conduct projects and experiments at its Idea Lab during the weekends. This Summer, it offers ten-day courses in Electronics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics and Robotics for students from classes eight to 11. “Making circuits that produce doorbell and gun shot sounds are taught inElectronics, programming of simple robotic operations are taught inRobotics,” informs the courses-in-charge, VITM. ‘How to create an android application’ is taught to participants ofApp Developmentworkshop and ‘how to operate programmable board for different operations’ is taught in a workshop onRaspberry Pi.These two workshops are for students from classes eight to 12. InArts and Science,students from classes six to eight, work on making scientific apparatus, labs and museums aesthetically appealing. Students between class six and 12 can enrol into this course. “Students not just from Bangalore but neighbouring districts and States as well attend our Summer courses. Some even opt for one in the morning and another in the afternoon,” informs the officer. The courses are free of cost for government and municipal corporation school students to support them going into scientific fields. “It is often these government school children who take this opportunity seriously and learn from everything they are exposed to. They might not be fluent speakers but are sharp learners,” he adds. On how to learn Science, he says: “Learning Science does not end with an exam. Like the arts, it has to be a hobby and a life-long pursuit. Purpose of these courses is to imbibe that in children.”    At JNP Apart from ten-day and two-week courses , shorter courses and day-long workshops in Astronomy, astro-computing and mathematics will be held over the next two months. Number of seats are limited and admission to some of the popular courses are already over. Last date to apply is April 2. Course-fee ranges from Rs. 100 to Rs. 500. There will be aTelescope Assemblyworkshop for four days in May. The planetarium also conducts weekend workshops and sky-gazing sessions regularly for the public. For more details, visit www.taralaya.org. At VITM Courses will be conducted in two batches, one in April and the other in May. Filled applications have to be submitted before April 10 for the first batch that starts from April 15. Deadline for submitting applications for May batch is April 20. Second batch of courses begin from May 6. Fee for the courses is Rs.1200 and workshops is Rs.1500. Government school students have to get their applications signed by the Principal for availing the benefit of free participation. To download applications, log onto www.vismuseum.gov.in.

What’s your narrative?|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Every person has his/her own strengths and weaknesses. Some people are good at learning, some people are better at being practical. There can be no set criteria of selecting students for admissions as there are students who might not score 90% but might be passionate for something other than studying set subjects. In order to be fair to everyone, universities ask for a Statement of Purpose (SoP). It is an essay that a student writes when seeking admission to universities (especially universities abroad). This essay reflects a student’s passion, work experience and the will to put his or her hundred percent in learning. “Many universities follow a holistic assessment process. This would mean, that they would assess the respective student not just on tangible measures like marks obtained in competitive exams like Boards, SAT/ACT, or GMAT/GRE but also measures such as purpose, commitment level, fitment with programme, overall personality, and so on. All of these together are referred to as an applicant’s narrative, profile or story. Application essays are purported to convey the applicant’s story,” says Abhishek Singhal, Co-Founder of UnivAdmitHelp. An SoP gives a student a chance to convince the evaluator that he or she is worth the university’s time, energy and resources. Having read hundreds of SoPs for a single course, an evaluator is trained to catch pre-drafted SoPs and is always looking for something genuine. “Think of it as an opportunity to give a monologue to someone who is interested but tired, kind of like the lecture after the lunch break,” Abhishek explains. Work out the WHYs The essay is considered to be one of the most important part of the admission process. Students should keep in mind that the evaluators are not looking for a mention of one’s educational qualifications and work experiences. They are looking for what did you personally to gain out of those educational degrees and what you learnt while working in the said field. It is important to answer all the ‘why’s like why this university, why this course, why this country. Chalk out your goal for the evaluator and explain briefly how you plan to work towards that goal. “An SoP is all about your independent thinking, experiences and failures, what helped you in becoming who you are today, and not just what you have mastered professionally, but also personally. If you go and venture your time in explaining your academic or professional achievements, it won’t do. It is already there for you to write about in other parts of your application,” says Adarsh Khandelwal, Co-Founder and Director at Collegify. Universities abroad have opened their admission for their 2019 intakes, so, before it is too late, we suggest students prepare their statement of purposes and get ready to prove their candidature.  Chalk out your goal for the evaluator and explain briefly how you plan to work towards that goal.   Quick points to remember while writing an SoP:  Why do you want to study this specific degree? Why do you want to study at this particular college? What do you plan to do with your degree after graduation? Would you choose to end up with a job or take up research?

Knowledge Quiz|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Q1BBC had a current affairs programme called “Panorama” since 1953, that is still going strong with a prime-time slot. In 1957, their programme consisted of a Swiss family harvesting a popular food item from their family tree. After the programme aired, the BBC received several calls asking for advice on growing their own tree to produce ______. The BBC told them to ‘place a sprig of ______ in tomato sauce and hope for the best.’ At the time, this dish was uncommon in the U.K., and was considered an exotic luxury. So, Britons were unaware of how it was made and from whence it came. This was BBC’s first ever April Fool’s joke, that was made 66 years ago today. What was this exotic food item that Britons thought they could grow? Q2The segment ‘Flight of the _______’ was featured in the opera “The Tale of Tsar Saltan”, written by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. Its composition is intended to evoke the seemingly chaotic and changing flying pattern of a _______. Despite the segment not being an area of focus in the opera, it gained fame because of its usage in pop culture. What is the segment named, given that it closes out an act where a character is turned into an insect, so he can fly away? Q3This university is an international and research-intensive institution located near Rajgir in India. It was set up to emulate the earlier version of the institution, widely considered the greatest of all ancient monasteries, and as the world’s first residential institution that stood for over 800 years. The initial version was likely ransacked and destroyed by the Mamluk dynasty. What is its name, that’s attributed to the abundance of lotus stalks in the area, and would come to mean ‘giver of lotus stalks?’ Q4This genetic hybrid of a female horse (mare) and a male donkey offers the best of both animals. It is less obstinate and more intelligent than a donkey, while it is more patient, hardy, and long-lived than horses. Often referred to as a beast of burden, this animal is mostly used for carrying loads. It was notably used in the Anglo-Afghan wars to carry ammo. Which ‘fantastic beast’ is this? Q5It was invented accidentally by Joseph Priestley in 1767, when he discovered a method to infuse water with carbon dioxide. It is known as sparkling water or carbonated water in many regions. However, in America and non-Commonwealth regions, a different term is used. It comes from the fact that a German town, renowned for its mineral springs holds a genericised trademark for this naturally carbonated water. What is it called? Q6This word comes from Etienne de _______, a French finance minister, who in 1759, was forced to impose severe economic restrictions, and cost-cutting measures upon the French people. Therefore, the word initially meant ‘to do or make something very cheaply.’ Before the advent of photography, this method was the cheapest way of recording a person’s image. It was usually done on a white background, and the person’s likeness would be portrayed by opaque, dark, black ink. (pictured) What is this method/word called?

GOLD RUSH|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Traditionally, the Gold Coast has long been Australia’s favourite holiday destination. While this stunning city by the sea is still popular among holiday-makers, the significant investment and subsequent growth, over recent years, has seen the Gold Coast emerge as a new-world city. Nowhere has this newfound maturity been more obvious, than within the Gold Coast’s education sector. The city is home to three world-class, research-intensive universities, each providing a unique offering to students. Bond University is privately operated, and sits in the Top 20 Best Small Universities of the World, according to the Times Higher Education rankings. The university is also rated as the number one university in Australia for student experience with five-star ratings, in every student category of the 2018 Good Universities Guide. Popular courses Around 40% of Bond’s population are international students, with the number of Indian students surging over the past three years, on an average increase of 20 per cent, per annum. The most popular courses for Indian students, at Bond University, are business, project management, construction practice and accounting. The university’s new Master of Business Data Analytics (Professional) is expected to be particularly popular with Indian students. The programme began in January, this year, and enrolments from India are already strong. Students first learn technical skills, including the R and Python languages most commonly used in the development of data programming, after which they focus on practical application, based on actual business problems in industries, such as health, marketing and finance.

As the modern world transitions itself to the information age and economy, there is essentially no area of modern business that is free of data-based decision-making, meaning that the most important component of any successful business, regardless of size or industry, will be its ability to mine its modern storehouse of customer and market information into gains, for the company’s efficiency and productivity,” says professor Stern.

Stand out in the crowd|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Keep these points in mind while creating your resume. CV vs resume When Sachin Tendulkar is invited as the chief guest, he submits a curriculum vitae or CV, but when Sachin Vaikuntham, a graduate, applies for a job he submits a resume (pronounced /rezumay/ and not /rezum/). Although curriculum vitae and resume often get used interchangeably, a curriculum vitae lists a person’s achievements, awards, and honours. A curriculum vitae is two pages or more in length. A resume is used by a job seeker and is never longer than a page. This does not mean using font size 8 to pack in information in one page, but to provide details relevant to a job or organisation. Common mistakes The most common mistake that applicants make is to photocopy and send the same resume to all clients. An effective resume writer puts in the effort to make his/her resume organisation-specific. Such a resume attracts the interviewer. Secondly, ineffective resumes lack structure, focus and headings. Structure gives logical sequence to the information in the resume. Structure contributes to clarity and focus, and reveals an uncluttered mind. Template You could try the following template to structure your resume effectively. Provide all the relevant personal details — name, birth date, correspondence address, email ID, mobile number, date of the resume. Write your job objective highlighting how you can contribute to the organisation’s goals, in a simple, non-exaggerated way in less than 10 words. Qualification: Begin with the last degree first and briefly list your degrees from Class X/XI onwards, name of the college/university, place, and marks. You can use a table to save space and present information in a visually appealing manner. Course and project details: Title, business implications and benefits to the client Skills: Only those relevant to the job Hobbies: Just one or two to bring out an all-rounded personality. If you don’t have hobbies, leave it blank or put in something simple such as listening to film music. But do not fib. A student once mentioned classical music and one of the interviewers turned out to be a classical singer. The student lost the opportunity as he couldn’t answer any question on music.  Checklist Once your resume is ready, check for the following before sending it. Does it: give a true description of your qualifications? match your beliefs? indicate preparation for stated career objective? reflect a realistic time span for fulfilling career goals? If you follow these tips and write an organisation-specific resume with focus and structure, it will stand every chance of being considered an effective resume. The writer is a trained coach and corporate consultant.   An effective resume writer puts in the effort to make his/her resume organisation-specific. Such a resume attracts the interviewer.

Knowledge Quiz|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Q1BBC had a current affairs programme called “Panorama” since 1953, that is still going strong with a prime-time slot. In 1957, their programme consisted of a Swiss family harvesting a popular food item from their family tree. After the programme aired, the BBC received several calls asking for advice on growing their own tree to produce ______. The BBC told them to ‘place a sprig of ______ in tomato sauce and hope for the best.’ At the time, this dish was uncommon in the U.K., and was considered an exotic luxury. So, Britons were unaware of how it was made and from whence it came. This was BBC’s first ever April Fool’s joke, that was made 66 years ago today. What was this exotic food item that Britons thought they could grow? Q2The segment ‘Flight of the _______’ was featured in the opera “The Tale of Tsar Saltan”, written by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. Its composition is intended to evoke the seemingly chaotic and changing flying pattern of a _______. Despite the segment not being an area of focus in the opera, it gained fame because of its usage in pop culture. What is the segment named, given that it closes out an act where a character is turned into an insect, so he can fly away? Q3This university is an international and research-intensive institution located near Rajgir in India. It was set up to emulate the earlier version of the institution, widely considered the greatest of all ancient monasteries, and as the world’s first residential institution that stood for over 800 years. The initial version was likely ransacked and destroyed by the Mamluk dynasty. What is its name, that’s attributed to the abundance of lotus stalks in the area, and would come to mean ‘giver of lotus stalks?’ Q4This genetic hybrid of a female horse (mare) and a male donkey offers the best of both animals. It is less obstinate and more intelligent than a donkey, while it is more patient, hardy, and long-lived than horses. Often referred to as a beast of burden, this animal is mostly used for carrying loads. It was notably used in the Anglo-Afghan wars to carry ammo. Which ‘fantastic beast’ is this? Q5It was invented accidentally by Joseph Priestley in 1767, when he discovered a method to infuse water with carbon dioxide. It is known as sparkling water or carbonated water in many regions. However, in America and non-Commonwealth regions, a different term is used. It comes from the fact that a German town, renowned for its mineral springs holds a genericised trademark for this naturally carbonated water. What is it called? Q6This word comes from Etienne de _______, a French finance minister, who in 1759, was forced to impose severe economic restrictions, and cost-cutting measures upon the French people. Therefore, the word initially meant ‘to do or make something very cheaply.’ Before the advent of photography, this method was the cheapest way of recording a person’s image. It was usually done on a white background, and the person’s likeness would be portrayed by opaque, dark, black ink. (pictured) What is this method/word called?

Warehouse of knowledge|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|What is the meaning of ‘not my first rodeo’? (N Bhanu, Hyderabad) First, let us deal with the pronunciation of ‘rodeo’. The ‘rod’ is pronounced like the word ‘road’ and the ‘eo’; sounds like the ‘io’ in ‘radio’. One way of pronouncing the word is ‘ROAD-i-yo’ — with the stress on the first syllable. A rodeo is an event in which people, usually cowboys, get a chance to display their various skills - riding a bull or a horse, wrestling a cow, roping a calf, etc. The people who take part in these rodeos are usually highly skilled and experienced. Therefore, when someone tells you something and you respond by saying, “This is not my first rodeo” or “This ain’t my first rodeo”, what you are suggesting is that this is not the first time you are doing something. You are experienced, and therefore, the other individual need not worry because you know what it is you are doing. The expression is mostly used in informal contexts in American English. Sunil is not at all worried about tomorrow’s presentation. He’s made many before. This is not his first rodeo. Don’t worry. Hema is not going to be nervous. This ain’t her first rodeo. She’s been in several finals before this. What is the difference between ‘godown’ and ‘warehouse’? (K Manjula, Trichy) In terms of meaning, very little. Both words can refer to a relatively large building that can be used to store materials of different kinds. Native speakers of English also use the word ‘warehouse’ to refer to any large store, retail or wholesale, which sells a product at a low price. Although the two words are listed in most dictionaries, all of them suggest that ‘godown’ is mostly limited to eastern Asia; it is most frequently used in India. Some dictionaries define it as ‘Indian English for warehouse’. ‘Godown’ is seldom used in native varieties of English; in fact, most native speakers may not even be aware of its existence. Unlike ‘godown’, the word ‘warehouse’ can be used as a verb as well. Atul’s company specialises in building warehouses/godowns. The students went to a discount electronic warehouse to buy their computer. If you ask me, it makes more sense to warehouse our entire inventory in one place. How is the word ‘behemoth’ pronounced? (Rajesh Trivedi, Jaipur) This rather formal word consists of three syllables. The first ‘e’ sounds like the ‘i’ in ‘sit’, ‘bit’ and ‘kit’; the second sounds like the ‘ee’ in ‘bees’, ‘sees’; and ‘knees’. The final syllable is pronounced like the word ‘moth’. The word is pronounced ‘bi-HEE-moth’ with the stress on the second syllable. According to scholars, the word comes from the Hebrew ‘b’hemah’ meaning ‘beast’. People believe ‘behemoth’ was first used to refer to the hippopotamus. When the word was borrowed into English, it was used to refer to any large animal. With the passage of time, however, the word began to be used with anything that was enormous in size and very powerful. For example, it is very common nowadays to refer to a huge organisation as a behemoth. It’s about time that the auto industry stopped manufacturing such gas guzzling behemoths. If the two companies merge, it’ll result in a behemoth that most industrialists will fear. ******** “Never approach a bull from the front, a horse from the rear or a fool from any direction.”Unknown The author teaches at the English and Foreign Languages University, Hyderabad. upendrankye@gmail.com

GOLD RUSH|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Traditionally, the Gold Coast has long been Australia’s favourite holiday destination. While this stunning city by the sea is still popular among holiday-makers, the significant investment and subsequent growth, over recent years, has seen the Gold Coast emerge as a new-world city. Nowhere has this newfound maturity been more obvious, than within the Gold Coast’s education sector. The city is home to three world-class, research-intensive universities, each providing a unique offering to students. Bond University is privately operated, and sits in the Top 20 Best Small Universities of the World, according to the Times Higher Education rankings. The university is also rated as the number one university in Australia for student experience with five-star ratings, in every student category of the 2018 Good Universities Guide. Popular courses Around 40% of Bond’s population are international students, with the number of Indian students surging over the past three years, on an average increase of 20 per cent, per annum. The most popular courses for Indian students, at Bond University, are business, project management, construction practice and accounting. The university’s new Master of Business Data Analytics (Professional) is expected to be particularly popular with Indian students. The programme began in January, this year, and enrolments from India are already strong. Students first learn technical skills, including the R and Python languages most commonly used in the development of data programming, after which they focus on practical application, based on actual business problems in industries, such as health, marketing and finance.

The wellness proposition|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|If you boil wellness down to its basics, it’s fairly uncomplicated: good health for as long as possible. It’s a journey that takes you through life’s ups and downs, with your body and mind reminding you to rest, eat wholesome food, stay active through the day, and laugh a little with family and friends. The in-road The problem is that we’re mostly out of sync with our bodies and minds because of our lifestyles of sitting and screens, and a disconnection from community and Nature. And where there is emptiness, the devil — let’s call him the marketeer — steps in, with a product for every niggling ‘problem’. A generation ago, health communication was often centred around fear-mongering, as in the case of anti-tobacco advertising or even cooking oil. It was a ‘give up the cigarette or else…’, or ‘buy this brand of oil or else…’ line. Today, fear-mongering has been turned on its head, says Vijay Raaghavan, Associate Director — Management Consulting, Healthcare, PwC, Bengaluru. “Communication is tuned to assuage fears we already have. So if I see the product is ‘all-natural’, ‘pollutant-free’, and I’m already worried about a polluted city, it’s pandering to it. But it’s always a set of pleasant-sounding words that are used, like ‘healing’,” he says. What’s changed is the approach to branding and packaging. While companies are spending more on R&D, it’s also true that “they use information from existing health research selectively,” says Dr Senthil Reddi, Additional Professor, Department of Psychiatry, NIMHANS, Bengaluru. The messaging is usually aligned with the socio-economic class that has the most disposable income. Out and about With social-media explosion, peer pressure is at its highest, and now extends through multiple age groups. “Travel to say, Paris and London is passé. It’s got to be to some exotic location,” says Janaki Abraham, Associate Professor, Department of Sociology, University of Delhi. In the same vein, rice gets substituted with quinoa, or whatever grain a celebrity is eating or a social-media influencer is pushing. On their part, influencers need to live (and show) the most authentic life possible. Take Jacqueline Fernandez, Pilates poster girl, who has a stake in Raw Pressery. She must not just lead a healthful life, but also prove she does on social media and at events. “Trust is key, which thanks to a serious trust-deficit in every sphere, is at an all-time low,” says Delhi-based Sanghamitra Chakraborty, who editedPreventionandWomen’s Healthmagazines when they were in the country, and who now editsReader’s Digest. So, she says, people tend to spend money on big brands with science-backed claims, feeling that they can be trusted. Also, she says we’ve simply outsourced our health, turning to dieticians, life coaches, personal trainers, when we all know what we really need to do. What is it about the exotic that lures us? The more complex a product sounds, the more aspirational it is. So out goes the face cream and in come day and night creams, among the arsenal of products you’re supposed to use for healthy skin. Raaghavan cites words that are key: organic, cold-pressed, virgin, gut health, all requiring a great deal of background reading. This makes it exclusive. It signifies you have a certain level of English language comprehension, data access, disposable income. The market calls these better-for-you products. “It’s a licence to charge more,” he says. Above and beyond “In some way, the crisis in health had to lead to this,” says Abraham. “Unfortunately, it’s so linked to money and has become another product that can only be consumed by some.” But that is how it is worldwide. Carol Singh started a cold-pressed juice brand in 2014, called Antidote. At the time, she says people had no awareness around the concept, but they were curious. “Around 2016, there was a bombardment of natural products, beauty products, supplements. Suddenly, brands were jumping on the wellness bandwagon. Now everyone wants to be in this space, know about it, talk about it.” She and co-founder Nadia Singh, felt the dialogue was getting diluted, so they began what they call Vitality Hours, a day-long event which began as an invite-only affair, and is now a platform where they put urban folk in touch with wellness professionals: yoga ‘gurus’, alternative medicine specialists, nutritionists. Next weekend, they’ll do their first two-day event. She’s candid about the fact that products and services in the wellness space are exclusive and more expensive, but also says it’ll trickle down. In a sense, it already has, if we look at the success of Patanjali that Baba Ramdev says will overtake HUL in the next financial year. Whether Patanjali (Saundarya Aloe Vera Gel, Neem Kanti Body Cleanser) or any of HUL’s brands (Dove, Lever Ayush) are actually facilitating wellness is anyone’s guess, but it’s clear there’s a market for them. This spread of wellness into the FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) segment is rooted to linking professionals — either doctors or others from the medical fraternity — with products. Take activated charcoal. Before it became popular in everything from burgers to smoothies, beauty brands used it. One product claim says it: “easily absorbs and lifts away the black impurities and pollution particles”, and “reveals your natural pure-looking white skin,” playing into insecurities at many levels. A recent change “It’s only over the past decade or so that we’ve learnt what the sun protection factor (SPF) is, or what an ‘active ingredient’ in a beauty product is. Beauty brands began moving into the dermat space,” says Chakraborty. Dermatologists also spoke on behalf of companies, much like how dieticians spoke on behalf of say, almond or olive-oil brands. Packaging and labelling for beauty products world-over changed, to be minimalistic, almost medicinal — it was not an indulgence anymore; it was a downright necessity. On the whole though, people don’t see the attention to wellness as bad: it is an awareness, after all. If it makes you happy to wear a hearable rather than a hearing aid, and you can afford to pay for the pop colours, you’ve landed on wellness. For the rest of us, there’s always preventive health.    A generation ago, health communication was often centred on fear-mongering  Tracking consumers In 2012, PwC did one of its earliest reports on the wellness consumer, drawing up a pyramid that traced the development of a consumer from passive to beginner, active, and finally a believer.

Alopecia areata|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Last week, the sister noticed a small patch of hair missing on the scalp above her left ear. Worried our parents would blame her curling iron for it, and confiscate the device, she resorted to calling me instead. She had what docs call Alopecia areata apparently a common condition, affecting over a million people in India. Hair falls in patches — generally, from the scalp — and in more severe cases, eyelashes, and eyebrows. “Though the exact reason for it is not established, the main postulated theory is that it is a specific type of autoimmune disease,” says Chennai dermatologist Dr Deepika Lunawat. Which essentially means that the body’s immune system starts acting against its own hair follicles, resulting in hair loss. “It is a polygenic (caused by multiple genes) disorder. Studies have shown that environmental factors such as high stress levels, low amounts of zinc and iron in the body, trigger the condition in an individual who is already genetically susceptible,” she says. If people in your family have had it as well, or if you have other autoimmune conditions, you are more likely to get it. “There is no complete cure for alopecia areata, but there are medications available to curtail the disease activity,” she says. “Topicals such as corticosteroids, when applied on the affected patchy areas, decrease inflammation, and encourage hair growth.” The other option, said the doctor, is immunotherapy and phototherapy. Oral medications are available as well, but doctors don’t often prescribe them, especially in teenagers, as it can affect growth. “If topical therapy isn’t responding, I would prefer intralesional corticosteroids over oral: you inject the medication into the patches, so that the effect is more concentrated,” she says. Despite the emotional or psychological toll of hair loss, the good news is that it is mostly cosmetic in nature, and not symptomatic of any underlying issues. You can expect your hair to return within two to six months. In this column, we demystify the buzzwords in wellness.

Primary apprehensions Q1.As the competition level will be high, will I able to make it? The competition level will be stiff for everybody. Whether you can make it or not will depend upon the actual performance on the exam day. Put in sincere efforts, after practising a number of JEE Main questions. Focus on speed and accuracy. Believe in yourself. Q2.I skipped a couple of topics. Should I start them now? Don’t start any fresh topic that you haven’t read in the last one year or recent months. Revise formulas and practice as many questions as you can, from already studied topics. Q3.What if paper’s difficulty level increases? If it increases, it will be for every aspirant. From your end, be prepared as per the syllabi of JEE Main, and solve adequate number of questions. With your best efforts, you can secure a seat in any branch of National Institute of Technology (NIT), and qualify for JEE Advanced. Q4.Where do I stand, as my friend’s preparation is better than mine? Selection in any competitive exam is based on one’s preparation level, comprehensive and analytical skills, time management, and most importantly, the actual performance on the exam day. You cannot control your friend’s performance, but you can certainly control yourself. If you give your best efforts, there will not be any need for comparison. Q5Are there any portals for mock tests? Yes. The most famous web portal for mock tests is www.mypat.in. This will help you familiarise yourselves with strong and weak areas. Stay fit and healthy for the exam, as it enhances your performance.  Subject-wise preparation Math Keeping in previous year trends, co-ordinate geometry, algebra, and calculus are topics which need to be given more attention. Topics such as mathematical reasoning, statistics and determinants, can be helpful in increasing your score. Refer to previous years’ question papers for better understanding of what to expect. Physics Kinematics and particle dynamics are topics which are asked most often. As per trends, mechanics, electricity and magnetism are the topics from which questions are always asked. Thermodynamics is the most important chapter, both in physics and chemistry. Wave optics is a much smaller topic to cover,when compared to ray optics. Vectors need to be studied properly, as it troubles most students. Modern physics is theoretical, yet some scoring questions are frequently asked. Chemistry Conceptual clarity, application skills, and awareness should be of focus. Special attention should be given to topics such as mole concept, chemical equilibrium, and electrochemistry. As far as inorganic chemistry is concerned, major topics such as chemical bonding, structures, processes, applications and coordination chemistry must be given special attention. First attempt theoretical questions before attempting those that require calculation. The writer is IIT JEE expert, FIITJEE  Familiarising yourselves with the past year paper trends will be handy.  Preparation checklist of JEE Main Be Thorough with exam pattern and syllabus  Self -confidence is the key to success  The right strategy for the exam  Speed and accuracy when attempting the questions  No one is perfect. Stay calm and do your best, on the day of the exam.

My contribution is significant|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|I was cast in a small role, in a theatrical production, recently. While the role was small, I believed it was important. Yet, when I got off the stage after our first performance, I asked myself if my role was required at all. Such thoughts that coursed through me made me feel less of who I was and I slipped into despondency. Feeling unimportant did not help, so I re-examined the role I had played. A concept that I learnt in college helped me process my thoughts. ‘Hygiene factor’, is the belief that the presence of a factor, trait or what have you may not add materially to enhancing value, yet its absence will certainly diminish the effect. In applying this thought to my predicament, I realised that while the role I played may not have added much body to the scene I acted in, yet without it, the scene I was cast to act in would have lacked depth. My appearance in the role provided context for effective enactment by the protagonist. The thought was very enabling and restored me, thus reducing my feeling unimportant. In my not being or wanting to see merit in what I was commissioned to do, I seemed to sabotage myself. As a young adult, I was once told ‘what you do unto yourself, you do to others’; if therefore I cannot appreciate myself, I may not be able to appreciate others. Small or otherwise, my contribution was important. Not acknowledging this to self only causes pain, disappointment and sadness in me. The writer is an organisational and behavioural consultant.

‘Find the balance’|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Kabir Bedi, an international actor, attended the book launch ofLives of Freda,at Asian College of Journalism, Chennai, where he had a conversation with students about his mother Freda Bedi, a British woman who fought for India’s independence. The book has been penned by eminent journalist and former editor of BBC, Andrew Whitehead. The actor talks about the various role models and influencers he’s met along the way and why one must learn to be proud of the institution you are from, despite its people. From the heart My parents were idealists. We had no money in the family. I had to work my way through college. I was studying History honours at St Stephen’s college in Delhi University. To earn some pocket money, I did commentary for AIR, read English news for television. Later, I even did a show called “Mirror of the world” on television. Remember, those were the earliest days of Indian television. History was one of my favourite subjects and I followed that in my college as well. People asked me, ‘What will you do with history?’ I was always interested in where we came from. We had some great professors as well. Ameen Sahib, who taught us medieval history, was a phenomenal man. He should have become the principal, given his qualifications. But he couldn’t because of circumstances. It was really unfortunate. A lot of characters I played on screen have been inspired from characters of medieval history. I played Shahjahan and Tuglaq on stage and screen as well. When I moved to Bombay, I worked with a theatre group under Alyque Padamsee. All my training came from acting through stage. You see, I could never become a conventional Bollywood superstar. I just couldn’t sing and dance. I always considered myself more of a dramatic actor, Shakespearean in nature. Acting wasn’t even my first choice. I wanted to be a filmmaker. That’s why I had joined advertising after college, and worked for two big MNCs — Ogilvy and Lintas. I was their film chief for five years. But as fate would have it, Girish Karnad’s first play “Tuglaq” became a major hit and producers came to sign me. I consoled myself saying that I could always come back to filmmaking. I was always inspired by historical greats such as Gandhi and Tolstoy. I wasn’t really moved to acting because of any Bollywood actors. There were no filmmaking schools those days. So I always respect the institutions I came from. I learnt this from my mother. While in Tibet, she was teaching English to monks. But frankly, some of them were absolutely worthless. I was extremely angry at my mother for bowing down to them. In reply, she said, “I bow down to the robe, not to the individual”. Always be proud of the institution you are from, despite of its people. I understand the pressure today’s youth faces. The ridiculous practice of judging solely by marks is unfair not only to students but colleges as well. How can you judge someone from the marks they have scored? There are various types of skills! I can only say this: Be clear of what you want to do and why. Don’t search for a ‘lucrative job’; search for a fulfilling one. Search for something that strikes a balance between the two. Second, ask yourself who is going to be the best father or mother to your child. If you get these two right, a major chunk of your problems won’t even exist. As told to Eetika Kapoor  The ridiculous practice of judging solely by marks is unfair not only to students but colleges as well.

Women are judged harshly, says Nicole Kidman|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Actor Nicole Kidman says she is astounded by the ‘harsh way women are judged’ in films. Nicole who plays Erin Bell — a police detective who is drawn back into an old case that left her traumatised — inDestroyersaid in an interview toThe Guardian, that the action movie offers a gritty and raw and totally authentic look at her character who doesn’t adhere to traditional beauty ideals. “A lot of times if you are going to be a female in an action film, they want you to look gorgeous, be bad a**, capable of firing guns and doing high kicks and still have lipstick and be svelte,” she said. “I’m always astounded at the harsh way in which women are judged, and I shouldn’t be.” The actor is also excited about the second season ofBig Little Lies, aired in India on Star World, explained how she hopes to help change things. “Maybe in 20 years time, for the next generation of women, it will be different but I want to be one of those women who’s helping carve a path for the next generation. I’m the recipient of those that have come before me to even be in this position.” IANS

Bald, brave, beautiful|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Whether it’s Anjali inThe Trip, Golu Gupta inMirzapuror Shaalu inMasaan, there is spunk and energy that permeates all of Shweta Tripathi Sharma’s characters. Talking to the actor makes it obvious where is comes from. After nine films, Tripathi Sharma’s love for her work is evident, and she’s happy with the experience of her new film,Gone Kesh, which released across the country on Friday. “I am one of those who will not do anything and just sit at home if I don’t like the work coming my way. I want to do a project with the right intentions — not money or popularity or to be busy. I’m not even concerned about being “out of sight, out of mind” because if that’s the motivation then I won’t give my 110% to the work. Whatever project I may be doing, I have to bloody well give it you 200% otherwise there is no point in doing it,” she shares. Support system In some ways, her character inGone Kesh, Enakshi is similar to Tripathi Sharma in real life. “I have had a simple life. I have amazing support from family, a great set of friends; financially and emotionally, I have been quite balanced,” says the actor. When she read the script written by Qasim Khallow, Tripathi Sharma was bowled over with the beautiful handling of the delicate subject. “The emotions and the relationships between Enakshi and her parents and her friends are the heart of the film. I realised that with any illness or condition, physically one person goes through it but their family and loved ones also go through it with them. It is this journey of her family and friends. Her dream is to become a dancer. But with alopecia, the way you perceive yourself changes; you don’t want to step out of the house. You know people will be staring, pointing, taunts and jokes will come your way. This drives people into a shell, which is heartbreaking,” she emphasises. Alopecia is a disease that attacks the hair follicles and causes hair to fall in large quantities forming bald patches. “I had no idea such a disease even existed. That’s when you feel so ignorant and small,” she confesses. She was ecstatic to be offered this project. “I kept thinking how cool this opportunity was and how many actors would even get a chance to do something like this! I was, in fact, thankful that this role came to me and nobody else. When I got to know that the poster would have me bald, I was even happier because it’s easy to look fabulous in a poster with a great photographer, a stylist and a whole team behind you.Yeh sab karne mein zyada mazaa hai.” Character sketches Playing a character as she ages in the film brought new challenges for the actor. “I got a chance to play a girl who grows up as the film progresses. It was challenging to understand how she deals with her condition and how it changes her. It showcases her journey from denial to acceptance.” Along with any film that deals with a medical condition comes a responsibility to portray it realistically and she was aware of that. “People who have alopecia should see the film and be able to relate to it. Thankfully, after watching the trailer, my Instagram was flooded with messages and photos from people suffering from the condition. Also, for people who knew others who had alopecia, they felt guilty because somewhere they had been insensitive. I was happy because as a society if we accept our faults and be more sensitive and supportive towards each other — alopecia or not — it’s great! Let’s just be there for each other,” she implores, the actor.  It was challenging to understand how she deals with her condition (alopecia) and how it changes her. It showcases her journey from denial to acceptance.

Options aplenty|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|I am a class XII humanities student, who is in the process of writing my board exams in English, Hindi, political science, geography, history, and physical education. I don’t know what I want to do after class XII, as I do not know my field of interest. I am a good listener, I can give good advice, and love reading. Other than that, I don’t know what I want to do. Please guide me about the different fields which are unique. - Divya Shrivastava Dear Divya, I hope you have completed your board exams and finally have some time to breathe and keenly think about your field of interests. Since you are a good listener and can give sound advice and love to read, do you want to consider psychology or law? Both are pretty unique and have brilliant scope. English literature is also a good option. What do you really enjoy? Would you want to teach? Do you see yourself being a therapist, or someone in the advertising world, an event manager? Or do you want to specialise in mass communication, work with a leading business house, or be a journalist? Please meet an equipped career counsellor to help you narrow your search with your interest and skill sets. I am 21 years old and have completed my B.E. in EEE. I got a job through college placements, but wasn’t interested in the software job. My passion was always helping people, so I opted for teaching. During B.E, I took tuitions for school students. Presently, I am working as a math faculty in a private institution, but I want to do something to improve people’s life and for my country. I am the only earning member in my middle-class family. How can I improve my career? - Subha Sri Dear Subha Sri, What else in addition to teaching would you like to do, in order to make a difference? Please shortlist specific areas of interest and skill sets that you would you want to develop (whilst working). Many reputed universities offer online courses, specialised programmes through distant education in social work, public health and administration, counselling psychology and master’s in many disciplines like math, for example. Alternatively, there are also organisations (like Teach For India) that are supportive of young adults and that you can join part-time till you find your calling. You could also join the Indian Army, Navy, or Air Force with your B.E credits, as a direct entry. Think of where you see yourself in the next few years and what makes you wake up effortlessly to be charged and ready for a bright new day; you will find your answer. I am currently pursuing my third year in B.A.(Hons.) English, from Delhi University. I am least interested in pursuing M.A. in literature and am considering an MBA in international business or HR. Is there any scope for me? I have studied science in higher secondary. What should I do? - Tina Shah Dear Tina, MBA in international business is a great choice as you can pursue a career as an international trade specialist, an economist, or specialise in marketing and sales or business development or supply chain, become a risk management director, or even run your own business, eventually. An MBA in human resource management, on the other hand, can equip you with the knowledge and skills that you need to deal with high stress situations and develop talent within an organisation. HR is, by far, the most important department of any organisation. Everything from hiring to firing, and in between, is taken care of by HR. HRM extends great potential for employee and company schemes, recruiting, increasing employee benefits, reworking effective policies, appraisals, designing and engaging in training and development, enhancing job stability and improving overall job satisfaction of the office employees. I am 15 years old and am currently studying in class X. I am passionate about astrophysics, and want to pursue a career in the same. Could you tell me about colleges offering courses in astrophysics (for example, B.Sc Astrophysics), in India, and what are the exams through which I must attempt, in order to get admission to such colleges? - Arjun Sijai Dear Arjun, I am assuming that you are passionate about physics, space, and understanding the physical world. First, you have to complete your 10+2 exam in the science stream, and do exceptionally well in math and physics. After 10+2, you will need to take mandatory entrance exams to make it to the college of your choice. You could do a B.Sc or BS-MS in physics and then complete your Ph.D. in astrophysics from IISc, IISERs, which are good institutes for a degree in physics, and of course, the IITs (engineering physics is a course offered by only a few IITs). You could also do B.E in EEE, ETC, or a course in engineering physics across the IITs, BITS Pilani, IISER Mohali, IIST, or other prominent institutes. All these institutions will give you a good headstart. The rest depends on your discipline and consistency. Disclaimer: This column is not a substitute for long-term therapy.

Stand out in the crowd|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Keep these points in mind while creating your resume. CV vs resume When Sachin Tendulkar is invited as the chief guest, he submits a curriculum vitae or CV, but when Sachin Vaikuntham, a graduate, applies for a job he submits a resume (pronounced /rezumay/ and not /rezum/). Although curriculum vitae and resume often get used interchangeably, a curriculum vitae lists a person’s achievements, awards, and honours. A curriculum vitae is two pages or more in length. A resume is used by a job seeker and is never longer than a page. This does not mean using font size 8 to pack in information in one page, but to provide details relevant to a job or organisation. Common mistakes The most common mistake that applicants make is to photocopy and send the same resume to all clients. An effective resume writer puts in the effort to make his/her resume organisation-specific. Such a resume attracts the interviewer. Secondly, ineffective resumes lack structure, focus and headings. Structure gives logical sequence to the information in the resume. Structure contributes to clarity and focus, and reveals an uncluttered mind. Template You could try the following template to structure your resume effectively. Provide all the relevant personal details — name, birth date, correspondence address, email ID, mobile number, date of the resume. Write your job objective highlighting how you can contribute to the organisation’s goals, in a simple, non-exaggerated way in less than 10 words. Qualification: Begin with the last degree first and briefly list your degrees from Class X/XI onwards, name of the college/university, place, and marks. You can use a table to save space and present information in a visually appealing manner. Course and project details: Title, business implications and benefits to the client Skills: Only those relevant to the job Hobbies: Just one or two to bring out an all-rounded personality. If you don’t have hobbies, leave it blank or put in something simple such as listening to film music. But do not fib. A student once mentioned classical music and one of the interviewers turned out to be a classical singer. The student lost the opportunity as he couldn’t answer any question on music.  Checklist Once your resume is ready, check for the following before sending it. Does it: give a true description of your qualifications? match your beliefs? indicate preparation for stated career objective? reflect a realistic time span for fulfilling career goals? If you follow these tips and write an organisation-specific resume with focus and structure, it will stand every chance of being considered an effective resume. The writer is a trained coach and corporate consultant.   An effective resume writer puts in the effort to make his/her resume organisation-specific. Such a resume attracts the interviewer.

The wellness proposition|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|If you boil wellness down to its basics, it’s fairly uncomplicated: good health for as long as possible. It’s a journey that takes you through life’s ups and downs, with your body and mind reminding you to rest, eat wholesome food, stay active through the day, and laugh a little with family and friends. The in-road The problem is that we’re mostly out of sync with our bodies and minds because of our lifestyles of sitting and screens, and a disconnection from community and Nature. And where there is emptiness, the devil — let’s call him the marketeer — steps in, with a product for every niggling ‘problem’. A generation ago, health communication was often centred around fear-mongering, as in the case of anti-tobacco advertising or even cooking oil. It was a ‘give up the cigarette or else…’, or ‘buy this brand of oil or else…’ line. Today, fear-mongering has been turned on its head, says Vijay Raaghavan, Associate Director — Management Consulting, Healthcare, PwC, Bengaluru. “Communication is tuned to assuage fears we already have. So if I see the product is ‘all-natural’, ‘pollutant-free’, and I’m already worried about a polluted city, it’s pandering to it. But it’s always a set of pleasant-sounding words that are used, like ‘healing’,” he says. What’s changed is the approach to branding and packaging. While companies are spending more on R&D, it’s also true that “they use information from existing health research selectively,” says Dr Senthil Reddi, Additional Professor, Department of Psychiatry, NIMHANS, Bengaluru. The messaging is usually aligned with the socio-economic class that has the most disposable income. Out and about With social-media explosion, peer pressure is at its highest, and now extends through multiple age groups. “Travel to say, Paris and London is passé. It’s got to be to some exotic location,” says Janaki Abraham, Associate Professor, Department of Sociology, University of Delhi. In the same vein, rice gets substituted with quinoa, or whatever grain a celebrity is eating or a social-media influencer is pushing. On their part, influencers need to live (and show) the most authentic life possible. Take Jacqueline Fernandez, Pilates poster girl, who has a stake in Raw Pressery. She must not just lead a healthful life, but also prove she does on social media and at events. “Trust is key, which thanks to a serious trust-deficit in every sphere, is at an all-time low,” says Delhi-based Sanghamitra Chakraborty, who editedPreventionandWomen’s Healthmagazines when they were in the country, and who now editsReader’s Digest. So, she says, people tend to spend money on big brands with science-backed claims, feeling that they can be trusted. Also, she says we’ve simply outsourced our health, turning to dieticians, life coaches, personal trainers, when we all know what we really need to do. What is it about the exotic that lures us? The more complex a product sounds, the more aspirational it is. So out goes the face cream and in come day and night creams, among the arsenal of products you’re supposed to use for healthy skin. Raaghavan cites words that are key: organic, cold-pressed, virgin, gut health, all requiring a great deal of background reading. This makes it exclusive. It signifies you have a certain level of English language comprehension, data access, disposable income. The market calls these better-for-you products. “It’s a licence to charge more,” he says. Above and beyond “In some way, the crisis in health had to lead to this,” says Abraham. “Unfortunately, it’s so linked to money and has become another product that can only be consumed by some.” But that is how it is worldwide. Carol Singh started a cold-pressed juice brand in 2014, called Antidote. At the time, she says people had no awareness around the concept, but they were curious. “Around 2016, there was a bombardment of natural products, beauty products, supplements. Suddenly, brands were jumping on the wellness bandwagon. Now everyone wants to be in this space, know about it, talk about it.” She and co-founder Nadia Singh, felt the dialogue was getting diluted, so they began what they call Vitality Hours, a day-long event which began as an invite-only affair, and is now a platform where they put urban folk in touch with wellness professionals: yoga ‘gurus’, alternative medicine specialists, nutritionists. Next weekend, they’ll do their first two-day event. She’s candid about the fact that products and services in the wellness space are exclusive and more expensive, but also says it’ll trickle down. In a sense, it already has, if we look at the success of Patanjali that Baba Ramdev says will overtake HUL in the next financial year. Whether Patanjali (Saundarya Aloe Vera Gel, Neem Kanti Body Cleanser) or any of HUL’s brands (Dove, Lever Ayush) are actually facilitating wellness is anyone’s guess, but it’s clear there’s a market for them. This spread of wellness into the FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) segment is rooted to linking professionals — either doctors or others from the medical fraternity — with products. Take activated charcoal. Before it became popular in everything from burgers to smoothies, beauty brands used it. One product claim says it: “easily absorbs and lifts away the black impurities and pollution particles”, and “reveals your natural pure-looking white skin,” playing into insecurities at many levels. A recent change “It’s only over the past decade or so that we’ve learnt what the sun protection factor (SPF) is, or what an ‘active ingredient’ in a beauty product is. Beauty brands began moving into the dermat space,” says Chakraborty. Dermatologists also spoke on behalf of companies, much like how dieticians spoke on behalf of say, almond or olive-oil brands. Packaging and labelling for beauty products world-over changed, to be minimalistic, almost medicinal — it was not an indulgence anymore; it was a downright necessity. On the whole though, people don’t see the attention to wellness as bad: it is an awareness, after all. If it makes you happy to wear a hearable rather than a hearing aid, and you can afford to pay for the pop colours, you’ve landed on wellness. For the rest of us, there’s always preventive health.    A generation ago, health communication was often centred on fear-mongering  Tracking consumers In 2012, PwC did one of its earliest reports on the wellness consumer, drawing up a pyramid that traced the development of a consumer from passive to beginner, active, and finally a believer.

NYC’s architectural theatre|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The notoriously busy JFK airport is set to get a touch of glamour this summer. A mid-20th century Jet Age relic, TWA Flight Center — which was rendered obsolete but never torn down — is being refurbished into a luxury hotel, reminiscent of the ’60s. Originally designed by Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen, known for his neo-futuristic style, the terminal-turned-hotel will feature six restaurant and eight bars, including celebrity chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s Paris Café. “It captures the moment in time, architecture and the golden age of air travel, when people used to dress up to fly,” says Fred Dixon, President and CEO, NYC & Company, over a cup of coffee at Mumbai’s Soho House on a balmy afternoon. Come May 15, the TWA Hotel will be open for guests, with 512 guest rooms that feature vintage interiors (midcentury modern Knoll furnishings) and noise-cancelling glass curtain walls. Looking to stepwells This summer is significant for the Big Apple, for more reasons than one. Alongside the month-long Pride celebrations in June, the city will witness the opening of various luxury spaces across its five boroughs, from dining to hotels to retail. Many much-anticipated projects are concentrated in the metropolis’ shiny new neighbourhood, Hudson Yards, touted to be the largest private real estate development space in the history of the US. “In excess of $25 billion in investments are coming to this one project,” Dixon reveals. In this part-commercial, part-residential space, high-end fitness brand Equinox is opening its first hotel in June. It has also attracted a number of celebrity chefs like Thomas Keller, David Chang and José Andrés to open their new outlets. The central attraction, however, is two large-scale art projects, The Shed and the newly-opened Vessel. Designed by British architects Heatherwick Studio, the latter is a 15-storey structure featuring 154 interconnected flights of stairs. “It’s got an India connection, since the inside is modelled after step wells,” says Dixon. The Shed, on the other hand, is a centre for performing and visual arts, which will open in April. Calling it a “building on wheels that can be expanded and opened up on demand”, Dixon says the opening performances will be a series of original mash-ups, including a collaboration between filmmaker Steve McQueen and record producer Quincy Jones. Times Square indulgence Outside Hudson Yard, traditionally touristy areas like Lower Manhattan is witnessing an explosion of luxury dining, hotel and retail experientials. There’s the much-anticipated arrival of Milan’s pioneering concept store, 10 Corso Como, a medley of art, clothing, music, design and food; Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s 50,000 sq ft food market, located in the restored Tin Building; a new bar and grill concept by Momofuku Group’s David Chang and Malibu Farm, all slated to open in 2019. “Times Square is also getting a taste of luxury after quite some time,” shares Dixon. Ian Schrager’s 452-room Edition launched this month with high-end restaurants developed by chef John Fraser and a modern cabaret bar. Midtown Manhattan will also see two new properties by Portuguese hotel group Pestana launching this summer, and architect Jean-Michel Gathy’s highly-anticipated uber-luxury brand, Aman New York, is opening its doors in 2020.

Stories from the chawl|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|A bowlful of papaya slices is sent into the room where newly-turned producers Madhuri Dixit-Nene and her husband Dr Shriram Nene are holding a series of interviews at Taj Lands End in Mumbai. With the sun setting outside, the two pose for final photographs, before returning to more questions about their first production, the recent Netflix release,15 August. Directed by Swapnaneel Jayakar, the two-hour-long, heart-warming Marathi film is about the dwellers of Gandhichawl. Being lauded for its real, believable characters, the film follows the events that unfold surrounding a surreptitious love story during their Independence Day celebrations. Script hunt The couple’s company, RnM (standing for Ram and Madhuri) Moving Pictures was launched in 2012, and has been focussing on health and lifestyle digital content. Shriram says that the “logical sequel” was to then produce films by tapping into his business acumen, and Madhuri’s experience of 35 years in front of the camera. And for Shriram, the transition from being a physician to partnering with his wife down this new path felt like a natural progression. “In that avatar you could cure one patient at a time,” he explains. “This is no different. If you make someone laugh, it’s often the best medicine.” Madhuri took control of sifting through scripts, and after about four years of seeking the right one, she found one that clicked. The star says, “[It was] the wholechawlset-up. I had relatives who lived inchawls, and I [have] stayed with them. So I felt like I know all these earthy, everyday characters. And it’s a layered comedy, so I thought it’d be ideal to make.” Women central Dixit’s transition comes at a time when there seems to be a wave of female actors taking the reins behind the camera. There’s Anushka Sharma who stepped into the arena withNH10(2015) with her production company Clean Slate Films, Deepika Padukone, who is both the lead and co-producer for the upcomingChhapaak, and Priyanka Chopra whose Purple Pebble Pictures is known to promote regional talent and cinema. While they certainly aren’t the first (even actors like Juhi Chawla and Hema Malini forayed into the field over a decade ago) the increasing rise of female actors in the production space seems to indicate a thirst to create and diversify the narratives in Indian films. “How come heroes become producers and nobody asks why? I think when you have worked for 10 to 15 years, you’re equipped to go behind the camera and produce movies,” says the Padma Shri awardee known for ’90s hits such asHum Apke Hain Koun,KhalnayakandBeta. But has the climate become more conducive for this shift? “It was very disorganised before, and that is changing now,” she says. Web battles The tricky part for the duo was having to pick between a release in theatres or going online. “This film could’ve done well in theatres,” says Shriram, “because it’s a basic story: a love triangle with different themes. [But] there are 9,000 theatres in India, of which 400 will play Marathi films for a few weeks.” While he elaborates that the Netflix release enables reach to its 139 million paid subscribers across 190 countries, Madhuri adds, “The content is amazing. You see Spanish and French movies, and diverse cultures. For the Indian diaspora abroad, they get to see a Marathi film and it stays on forever!” The conversation soon shifts towards films the couple wish they could have produced. “We have two teenage boys,” says Nene, before sheepishly adding “So I see a lot of Marvel films, unfortunately. ButBlack Panther(2018) stood out.” Dixit admits she’s more of a whodunit aficionado, and while she enjoyed last year’sAndhadhun, the actor has barely gotten time to catch up on recent releases. “I’m just looking at the future and asking, ‘what kind of films do we want to make?’”. Shriram agrees, “I think our films should always make people happy, and maybe teach a lesson in the process. But more than anything else, entertain them.” The year ahead The star’s plate is full with Karan Johar’s multi-starrer productionKalank, and Tahira Kashyap’s directorial débutSharmaji Ki Beti. On how she has been balancing her acting and new role as a producer, she says, “It’s been adventurous.15 Augustwas going on, and then I was simultaneously working onKalank.And then I had these two teenagers in the house which is another production! And [there’s also] a little puppy now! It couldn’t be busier, right?” concludes Madhuri, with her characteristically infectious laugh.  How come heroes become producers and nobody asks why? When you’ve worked for 15 years, you’re equipped to go behind the camera

Knowledge Quiz|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Q1BBC had a current affairs programme called “Panorama” since 1953, that is still going strong with a prime-time slot. In 1957, their programme consisted of a Swiss family harvesting a popular food item from their family tree. After the programme aired, the BBC received several calls asking for advice on growing their own tree to produce ______. The BBC told them to ‘place a sprig of ______ in tomato sauce and hope for the best.’ At the time, this dish was uncommon in the U.K., and was considered an exotic luxury. So, Britons were unaware of how it was made and from whence it came. This was BBC’s first ever April Fool’s joke, that was made 66 years ago today. What was this exotic food item that Britons thought they could grow? Q2The segment ‘Flight of the _______’ was featured in the opera “The Tale of Tsar Saltan”, written by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. Its composition is intended to evoke the seemingly chaotic and changing flying pattern of a _______. Despite the segment not being an area of focus in the opera, it gained fame because of its usage in pop culture. What is the segment named, given that it closes out an act where a character is turned into an insect, so he can fly away? Q3This university is an international and research-intensive institution located near Rajgir in India. It was set up to emulate the earlier version of the institution, widely considered the greatest of all ancient monasteries, and as the world’s first residential institution that stood for over 800 years. The initial version was likely ransacked and destroyed by the Mamluk dynasty. What is its name, that’s attributed to the abundance of lotus stalks in the area, and would come to mean ‘giver of lotus stalks?’ Q4This genetic hybrid of a female horse (mare) and a male donkey offers the best of both animals. It is less obstinate and more intelligent than a donkey, while it is more patient, hardy, and long-lived than horses. Often referred to as a beast of burden, this animal is mostly used for carrying loads. It was notably used in the Anglo-Afghan wars to carry ammo. Which ‘fantastic beast’ is this? Q5It was invented accidentally by Joseph Priestley in 1767, when he discovered a method to infuse water with carbon dioxide. It is known as sparkling water or carbonated water in many regions. However, in America and non-Commonwealth regions, a different term is used. It comes from the fact that a German town, renowned for its mineral springs holds a genericised trademark for this naturally carbonated water. What is it called? Q6This word comes from Etienne de _______, a French finance minister, who in 1759, was forced to impose severe economic restrictions, and cost-cutting measures upon the French people. Therefore, the word initially meant ‘to do or make something very cheaply.’ Before the advent of photography, this method was the cheapest way of recording a person’s image. It was usually done on a white background, and the person’s likeness would be portrayed by opaque, dark, black ink. (pictured) What is this method/word called?

GOLD RUSH|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Traditionally, the Gold Coast has long been Australia’s favourite holiday destination. While this stunning city by the sea is still popular among holiday-makers, the significant investment and subsequent growth, over recent years, has seen the Gold Coast emerge as a new-world city. Nowhere has this newfound maturity been more obvious, than within the Gold Coast’s education sector. The city is home to three world-class, research-intensive universities, each providing a unique offering to students. Bond University is privately operated, and sits in the Top 20 Best Small Universities of the World, according to the Times Higher Education rankings. The university is also rated as the number one university in Australia for student experience with five-star ratings, in every student category of the 2018 Good Universities Guide. Popular courses Around 40% of Bond’s population are international students, with the number of Indian students surging over the past three years, on an average increase of 20 per cent, per annum. The most popular courses for Indian students, at Bond University, are business, project management, construction practice and accounting. The university’s new Master of Business Data Analytics (Professional) is expected to be particularly popular with Indian students. The programme began in January, this year, and enrolments from India are already strong. Students first learn technical skills, including the R and Python languages most commonly used in the development of data programming, after which they focus on practical application, based on actual business problems in industries, such as health, marketing and finance. Exposure to expertise In Bond’s trademark small classes, students are mentored by Australia’s leading economists, statisticians, financial analysts and mathematicians, including Professor Steven Stern, custodian of cricket’s Duckworth Lewis Stern (DLS) system for rain-affected matches. “Skills in data analytics are in such high demand that it is a popular area for continuing professional development. As the modern world transitions itself to the information age and economy, there is essentially no area of modern business that is free of data-based decision-making, meaning that the most important component of any successful business, regardless of size or industry, will be its ability to mine its modern storehouse of customer and market information into gains, for the company’s efficiency and productivity,” says professor Stern. Griffith University has more than 50,000 students across Queensland, with the Gold Coast hosting its largest campus. The university ranks in the top two % of universities globally, and is recognised as one of the world’s top young universities. Interest in studying at Griffith University’s Gold Coast campus is growing among prospective students as to what the university and the City of the Gold Coast has to offer, as a study destination. Located opposite the site of the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games village, Griffith’s Gold Coast campus is a core partner in the Gold Coast’s $ 5 billion health and knowledge precinct development that is attracting multinational companies, keen to take advantage of the expertise available and the outstanding graduates. Griffith offers a comprehensive range of programmes and disciplines at its campus, including leading programmes in health, IT and engineering, science and business, as well as law and social sciences. Professor Sarah Todd, Vice President (Global), Griffith University says, “We have Indian students coming to our Gold Coast campus to study IT and engineering, business, sports management, health services management and architecture, as well as in a number of other areas. With Griffith University continuing to progress in the international rankings, we offer Indian students the opportunity to study on a modern campus where they are supported to achieve their potential.” Southern Cross University, is Australia’s only beachside campus. It is the newest of the Gold Coast’s universities and is ranked in the top 150 universities under 50 years old, in the world, according to the Times Higher Education Young University rankings. Options galore Popular Southern Cross University programmes include Bachelor of Business, Bachelor of Information Technology, Bachelor of Hospitality and Tourism Management, Master of Engineering Management/Master of Business Administration double degree, and Master of International Tourism and Hotel Management. Located right next door to the Gold Coast International Airport, Southern Cross University also offers a three-year Bachelor of Business (aviation management) with a fully-credited CASA Commercial Pilot Licence. Sanjeet Karkada is an expatriate Indian student, who had always dreamt of becoming a pilot and is undertaking the course. Sanjeet says, “When you first get in the cockpit of the plane, you can feel a little overwhelmed with all the buttons and controls. “But once you are in the air, it is beautiful. You don’t feel nerves, you just enjoy every moment.” Southern Cross has a substantial community of students from the sub-continent, particularly from India and Nepal. Don Whitford, the University’s regional manager of South Asia, Middle East and Africa, says, “Southern Cross University welcomes international students from more than 60 countries, and students from South Asia form an important part of our international student cohort.” The writer is content editor, Study Gold Coast  The most popular courses for Indian students, at Bond University, are business, project management, construction practice and accounting.

Not your usual job|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Deciding what you want to do for a living right after you have graduated from college can be quite daunting. It is common for us to think of our chosen field of study as the only means to a job. But what we do not realise is there are some really unusual, uncommon options out there for us to choose from, and they pay well too! Here are a few options to get you to consider getting off the beaten track... Golf ball diver Are you someone who loves adventure, outdoors, and likes to take risks too? Then, you are a perfect candidate to be a golf ball diver. They are responsible for collecting all the golf balls from the bottom of ponds on golf courses. It may sound easy and fun, but the truth is that along with the balls, be assured to find other stuff too. But that’s what makes it a lucrative choice as according toESPN, golf ball divers can earn up to a $1,00,000 dollars! Furniture tester Imagine a job where all you have to do is simple sit all day. Sounds like fantasy, doesn’t it? As a furniture tester, you will get to do just that! In addition, you do need to give your opinion on how comfortable the experience was. While machines can make the furniture, they cannot judge if humans will enjoy it. And that’s why people are employed to do this. In fact, a variant of this is bed testing where people are hired to test beds — mattresses and pillows, to be specific — for companies and hotels. You are paid to sleep at work! A good bed tester must know how to lie down to check if the mattress has dips and if the edges of the bed are strong enough to sit on. Pet food taster Ever wondered what the food your dog is eating tastes like? As a pet food taster, it will be your job to know. You will have the responsibility of making sure our pets eat clean and good quality food. You will have to taste pet food to evaluate the flavours and check if it is up to quality standards. Nobody deserves bad food, and definitely not the favourite member of the family. Wildlife photographer If you enjoy photography and have a penchant for wildlife, becoming a wildlife photographer is a good idea. Touted to be one of the most challenging forms of photography, you will need to have good skills. While a degree is not mandatory, you must be willing to travel and have a passion for nature. Contributing to travel and environment magazines likeNational Geographicor websites and television channels, can also be a lucrative option. Depending upon your shots, creativity, and sense of timing, you will be offered projects. You can earn anywhere from Rs. 1.25 lakhs to Rs. 2.5 lakhs per month. Horse exerciser Horse exercisers are individuals responsible for riding racehorses during workouts to keep the animals fit and race-ready. They must be skilled at controlling horses and need to be in top form fitness-wise to be able to give the horses a good workout. Being used as race horses, the riders must know the horse’s running rate and plan their workouts accordingly. If you have certification and training you could start with a salary of Rs. 5000 a day.

India gets surveillance satellite|Bengaluru|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) launched the country’s first electronic surveillance satellite, EMISAT, from Sriharikota in coastal Andhra Pradesh on Monday morning. As many as 28 small satellites of international customers were also put in space as secondary riders. Space-based electronic intelligence or ELINT from the 436-kg spacecraft will add teeth to situational awareness of the armed forces as it will provide location and information of hostile radars placed at the borders; this will be another dimension to the current land or aircraft-based ELINT, according to defence experts who did not wish to be named. ISRO, which is said to have built the satellite body for the DRDO payload, merely said the spacecraft would measure the electromagnetic spectrum. Once the last cubesat came out, ISRO Chairman K. Sivan announced: “Today PSLV-C45 has successfully injected the ISRO-made EMISAT in a 748-km orbit as well as 28 customer satellites in a 504-km orbit as sought by the customers.” An ISRO release said that as EMISAT came out, “[Its] two solar arrays were deployed automatically. The ISRO Telemetry Tracking and Command Network at Bengaluru assumed control of the satellite. In the coming days, the satellite will be brought to its final operational configuration.” A new PSLV team executed the mission as the previous programme head R. Hutton has moved to the headquarters in Bengaluru as the director of the Human Space Flight Centre. D

When Gervais grieves|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Among the silly feature stories Tony, a scribe, reluctantly pursues for theTambury Gazette, there’s one that involves a man who believes the water leakage stain on his wall resembles the face of (actor/director) Kenneth Branagh. This man also casually shares information about his wife being mugged recently, as if deliberately downplaying the incident to not take attention away from his big Branagh discovery, which is ideal fodder for Tony to launch into a diatribe against him. “Any stain looks like Kenneth Branagh,” Tony grunts to his colleague and loyal friend, Lenny, after. Played — rather fittingly — by Ricky Gervais, Tony is a man who’s out to get the world one snarky retort at a time. He can’t help being a complete douche to everyone he comes in contact with, whether it’s the postman who sneakily reads his mail, or even Lenny, whose “fat neck” Tony pulls on at one point. “Like a pug,” he jokes. Tony believes he has earned the right to torment people after losing his wife of many years to cancer. The sudden end of the only successful relationship he’s ever had (we never see any other family, or a social circle) has thrown him into a downward spiral. His house resembles a teenager’s dorm room, his pet dog has to settle for canned food in the absence of kibble, and Tony is a blade away from slitting his wrists and bleeding to death. Quite a few comedy writers lately have turned to a theme that only the most somber films and TV shows dealt with in the past — death. I earlier wrote aboutRussian Dollin this column, a brilliant show about a woman stuck in a loop where she dies repeatedly in the most gruesome fashion. Another favourite of mine isThe Good Place, about a self-centred woman accidentally landing up in heaven after dying in a tragic accident. Gervais, who’s known for his dry, sardonic wit even in his stand-up routine, fashions the perfect plot for his talent to shine through. Few actors would revel in the opportunity to play an unlikable, sour guy whose humane side is intact, and Gervais plays Tony with a remarkable balance of sarcasm and vulnerability. He also writes and directs six episodes packed with many uncomfortable laughs even as he masterfully tackles bigger themes like depression and loneliness. Tony’s life is so full of emptiness, the audience can’t help but feel sympathy even when he’s being a complete moron. Ironically, the only profound relationships Tony forms are with women who enter his life after his spouse’s death, be it rookie journalist Sandy (Mandeep Dhillon) who Tony is supposed to mentor, or sex worker Roxy/Daphne (Roisin Conati) who Tony pays to do his dishes. Another bond he forges is with the septuagenarian Anne (the charming Penelope Wilton), who visits her husband’s grave to have imaginary conversations with him. Then there is the relationship he isn’t able to let go off — with his dead wife, Lisa (Kerry Godliman). We only ever see her through video footage, made up of messages she left behind for him on her deathbed, and home video recordings of Tony pulling various pranks on her. Through these recordings, we realise that Tony is more-or-less the same man he was before his wife’s death, always finding devious ways to pull a fast one on a woman he dearly loved; except his intentions were not quite sinister then. In a rare moment of self-realisation, Tony refers to himself as “an angry rat stuck in a trap” who lashes out at others to grapple with his own misery.After Lifeis about him discovering that empathetic side of his personality which he keeps buried under the rude, arrogant façade created to deal with pain — a side that everyone around seems to be aware of, except Tony himself.

More curators, please, we’re in India|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|It was in the evenings, while unwinding together after a day of work, that a simple truth dawned on the motley group of Fellows at the Curatorial Intensive of South Asia (CISA). Close to half were Indians, and they would break into snatches of Hindi when addressing one another. Fellows from the other countries would pick up on some words and find similar-sounding ones in their own languages. “This really makes you realise that we in South Asia, are a part of a larger, shared cultural ecology,” says Anuj Daga, 33, an architect and curator based in Mumbai. In 2018, Daga was a Fellow at the CISA, a two-week residential workshop that Khoj International Artists Association, a Delhi-based arts non-profit, holds annually along with Goethe-Institut in India. Currently, CISA open to early-career curators, is inviting applications from prospective participants from all South-Asian nations, including Afghanistan and Iran, for its third edition that starts in July. The idea to utilise the museum space, for national self-fashioning, to make crucial socio-political points, or to offer spaces of historical and cultural reflection, is slowly gathering steam in the South-Asian region. With this, so is a demand for curators with well-rounded perspective and training. “We realised that there is a gap specifically in curatorial training...outside of the western paradigm,” says Mario D’Souza, programmes manager and curator at Khoj. For CISA, Khoj brings in weighty names from academia and the art industry as trainers and guest speakers. Natasha Ginwala, independent curator who recently worked on the Coutour Biennale 8 in Belgium; Naman Ahuja, a professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University’s School of Arts and Aesthetics; curator Shuddhabrata Sengupta of Raqs Media Collective; and Abhay Sardesai, the editor of Art India Magazine, are some of the Indians on faculty. Leonard Emmerling, curator and director of programmes South Asia from the Goethe-Institut/Max Mueller Bhavan joins them, along with Benjamin Mayer-Krahmer, a professor of art history, visual culture, and cultures of the curatorial at the Academy of Fine Arts Liepzig, forming the programme’s international faculty. As with any programme though, some of CISA’s alumni have found parts of their two-week residential course redundant. Khoj’s jury has already laid down the basic requirement that applicants either come in with a background in the humanities, or have experience with realising a few curatorial projects. The first category welcomes the deep dive into art history and curatorial theory, the latter not so much. Some also hope that the programme reaches more areas and people outside the fraternity. “I’d expressed in review that it would help to get in scholars from other South Asian countries too,” Daga, who is currently an assistant professor at the School of Environment and Architecture in Mumbai, says. Another fellow, NayanTara Gurung Kakshapati, 37, from Nepal agrees, noting that “A few mentors from around South Asia would make it feel more like a regional programme and experience.” Both fellows have extensive prior experience in curation. Daga had worked as assistant curator on the ‘Young Subcontinent’ project for the Serendipity Arts Festival in Goa, while Kakshapati co-founded Photo Kathmandu, Nepal’s first international photography festival among other projects including the Nepal Picture Library. Both however stressed how the programme’s role as a platform in bringing together like-minded people from a diverse range of practices, and more importantly, how it allowed them space to reflect, question, read, and widen their horizons, that was valuable to them. CISA’s scope ranges from the origins of the museum, understanding the biennale model, and thinking and theory. “The nuts and bolts, really,” says D’Souza, adding that it even teaches fellows how to write a curatorial note. They are then given six months and a budget, space, mentorship, and assistance to develop their own exhibition, giving many a launchpad to become independent curators. Last year, 70 people applied to CISA. Only 13-15 make it as fellows. With sustained interest and quality participation from neighbours, the space for developing this conversation is only becoming more open. The deadline to apply for CISA 2019 is 15th April.

SC questions Assam govt. over untraced foreign immigrants|NEW DELHI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Supreme Court on Monday questioned the Assam government’s efforts to trace over 70,000 illegal immigrants, who have already mixed with the local population in the State. A Ministry of Home Affairs affidavit shows that 91,609 persons were declared ‘illegal foreigners’ by the Foreigners Tribunals in Assam till March 2018. Of these, 72,486 are absconding. “This is quite a large number,” a worried Home Ministry told the court. A Bench of Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi said there might even be “undeclared foreigners” who had succeeded in “merging with the local population” in the State. “What is the number of these undeclared foreigners?” The CJI’s question drew a blank from the Assam government. The Home Ministry explained that persons declared ‘illegal foreigners’ by the tribunals either abscond immediately or are already untraceable. Now, 829 persons declared ‘foreigners’ by the tribunals and 115 foreigners, who have completed their jail term, are lodged in the six jail-cum-detention centres in the State. “But where are those illegals who have neither been deported nor are lodged in the detention centres? Where are they? How will you track them? What have you done in the past five years?” Chief Justice Gogoi asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing Assam. Mr. Mehta initially requested the Bench to defer the case. Many obstacles The hearing saw the court criticise the policy of “pushing back” illegal foreigners to Bangladesh without enquiring about their country of origin. This was in the backdrop of the Home Ministry spelling out obstacles in the nationality verification process for illegal foreigners. Wrong information “They provide wrong information. Details of the country of origin depend completely upon information provided by the persons,” the affidavit said. Though as a sovereign nation, India has the absolute right to deport illegal immigrants, it cannot do so randomly, the affidavit said, agreeing with the court’s point of view. Mr. Mehta said the “push-back” policy was dropped in 2013, and now diplomatic channels were employed to determine the nationality of an illegal foreigner and deport the person. The Ministry’s affidavit said the Assistant High Commissioner of Bangladesh visits detention centres to talk to detainees. If their information is proved correct, they are expeditiously issued travel documents. “You have been pushing them back without knowing their country of origin. Now, suddenly you have grown wise and are resorting to diplomatic channels,” the CJI said.

Naidu using Polavaram project as an ATM: Modi|STaff Reporter|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Accusing Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu of according top priority to his family welfare rather than the development and welfare of the State, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday alleged that Mr. Naidu was considering the Polavaram irrigation project as an ATM and trying to withdraw money time and again by escalating the costs. “Through the ‘Sevamitra’ app, Mr. Naidu’s government resorted to steal sensitive data pertaining to people of Andhra Pradesh. Do we need the State to be ruled by such a man with ulterior motives?” he asked at a public meeting here. Mr. Modi said the State government had so far allocated Rs. 7,000 crore towards the project but the State government had failed to speed up the work. “Like all the leaders who ruled the State in the last 40 years, Mr. Naidu too lacks sincerity towards completing the Polavaram, the lifeline of this State. The delay is only due to the laxity shown by the State government in the last five years.” Lambasting the Chief Minister as “U-turn Babu,” “Sticker Babu,” and “Bhallaladeva of Baahubali,” Mr. Modi said Mr. Naidu only knew well the art of promoting the Central government’s schemes as his own and campaigning them with his photographs. “Ours is the first government that established a separate Ministry and allocated special budget for the fishermen. We know the value of the taxpayers money and used it on infrastructure development. To honour the sincere taxpayers, we have increased the no-tax bracket to Rs. 5 lakh per annum,” he said. Highlighting the need for electing a sincere and hard-working political party that takes care of the welfare of the future generations, Mr. Modi urged people to go through the good work done by the BJP-led NDA government in the last five years before casting their vote. “Except the BJP, all other parties are nothing but family empires. Those leaders are more interested in promoting their wards, rather than taking care of the welfare of the public,” he said referring to the Congress and the regional parties. “They all now formed a grand alliance. Give us an opportunity to serve you the next five years and ensure bright future of your wards.” State unit president Kanna Lakshmi Narayana presided. Leaders and candidates from the East and the West Godavari districts were present.

PM has betrayed A.P.: Naidu|VIJAYAWADA|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Twitter as to what happened to the promises, particularly the Special Category Status (SCS), made by him to Andhra Pradesh at the time of bifurcation and whether he was not ashamed of speaking about development of the State having “thrown water and mud at it”. Referring to Mr. Modi’s visit to Rajahmundry, Mr. Naidu stated that people should not forget their betrayal by the NDA government, the unfulfilled promises, the discrimination and lack of support, which pushed the State into dire straits. He asserted that the Modi government was going to pay a heavy price for its autocratic rule.

Udupi CMC blamed for water scarcity|UDUPI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Mahiti Seva Samiti, a non-governmental organisation, has urged the Udupi City Municipal Council to ensure proper distribution of drinking water to Kodankur area soon. Addressing presspersons here, Raviraj Shetty, president of the Kodankur unit of the samiti, said that the Udupi City Municipal Council had started water rationing in the city citing the decreasing level of water at the Baje dam against the Swarna. The Municipal Council was supplying water once in three days now. But this had resulted in disruption of water supply and the people living in the Kodankur area were suffering a lot due to water scarcity. Though there was enough water in Baje dam, the Municipal Council had resorted to water rationing and created water scarcity, he said. Instead of supplying water once in three days, water should be supplied on alternate days as this would address the water problem to a large extent. If the water problem in Kodankur was not addressed soon, the residents might have to boycott the parliamentary polls, he said. Though the municipality had claimed that it was supplying water through tankers, so far only six tankers were being operated in Kodankur. This was not enough for people living there. “Where are the lakhs of rupees being spent for water supply through tankers going?” he asked. Though some officers from the Udupi City Municipal Council got transferred, they returned to their old posts within months. Though there was no water problem, the officers had created it [water shortage] to loot the municipal coffers, he said. Though the Municipal Council had called for rejuvenation of old wells, only a few wells had been rejuvenated. The Municipal Council should clean the remaining wells so that people could use water, Mr. Shetty said. G.A. Koteyar and Gita Suvarna, office-bearers of the samiti, were present. ‘Though there is enough water in Baje dam, the Municipal Council has created water scarcity’ ‘Though there is enough water in Baje dam, the Municipal Council has created water scarcity’

Poll official seeks report on Adityanath’s remarks|NEW DELHI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Uttar Pradesh Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) has sought a report from the Ghaziabad District Magistrate on Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s remarks, describing the armed forces as “Modiji ki sena” at a political rally in Ghaziabad on Sunday. The remarks drew condemnation from the Opposition parties. “Taking cognisance of the issue, the State CEO has asked for a report from the District Election Officer [the District Magistrate] by Tuesday noon,” said the Election Commission. In his speech, Mr. Adityanath said the Congress served “biryani” to terrorists, while Mr. Modi’s forces treated them with bullets and bombs. He said Congress leaders used “Ji” for terrorists like Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar but under the Prime Minister’s leadership, the BJP-led government was destroying their camps. Proud of Army: Mamata Reacting sharply to Mr. Adityanath’s comments on Twitter, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee expressed shock, saying it was an insult to the armed forces. “We are proud of our Army. They belong to all. They are a great asset of our nation, and not a cassette of the BJP. People of this country must reject this statement,” she said. Congress leader Priyanka Chaturvedi said: “They are India’s Armed Forces not the private army of Prachaar Mantri. Adityanath must apologise.” (With agency inputs)

Huge cash haul from premises of Durai Murugan’s ‘associate’|VELLORE|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Income Tax Department officials on Monday seized hundreds of cash bundles stacked in gunny bags, shopping bags and cartons from the house and cement godown of Poonjolai Srinivasan, a DMK functionary in Nadumottur village, Katpadi in Vellore district. He is believed to be a close associate of DMK treasurer and Deputy Leader of Opposition Durai Murugan, whose son Kathir Anand is contesting from the Vellore Parliamentary constituency in the general elections. Searches were also conducted at educational institutions and premises managed by Mr. Anand. At the time of going to print, the searches that began in the morning were on at some of the locations in Vellore and officials were yet to ascertain the value of the seizure that is suspected to run into several crore rupees. Currency counting machines were also requisitioned from local banks. IT Department officials, privately claimed, that the currency bundles were neatly packed in envelopes with markings indicating that they were intended to be distributed to voters. Clips on social media While usually the IT Department maintained secrecy in search operations, on Monday video clips and photos of cash bundles being examined were circulated widely on mobile messaging platforms.  DMK president M.K. Stalin charged that the IT searches were conducted at the behest of the BJP-led Central government to intimidate the Opposition. Mr Durai Murugan alleged that there was a conspiracy to rescind the poll notification in Vellore Lok Sabha constituency and two Assembly constituencies in the region where by-polls are due.

Former IL&FS vice-chairman arrested|Mumbai|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The former vice-chairman and managing director of Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS) Hari Sankaran was arrested by the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) on Monday and remanded in police custody till April 4. Mr. Sankaran was arrested in connection with the ongoing investigations into the affairs of IL&FS and its group entities, an official spokesperson said. “He has been arrested on the grounds that he abused his powers in IL&FS through his fraudulent conduct and in granting loans to entities which were not creditworthy or have been declared non-performing assets (NPAs) and caused wrongful loss to the company and its creditors,” the spokesperson added.

A subsequent series of defaults caused a systemic problem with many NBFCs running into financial issues.

‘It is important to convince people that we can give a stable government’|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Exuding confidence that the Opposition alliance will come together after victory in the Lok Sabha election, Janata Dal (S) patriarch and one of the architects of the Mahagathbandhan,H.D. Deve Gowdasays the BJP’s references to ‘mahamilavat’ reveal its desperation. Do you think air strikes post-Pulwama and the ASAT test have shifted the poll narrative to security and nationalism and therefore, in favour of the BJP? Exploiting the achievements of the Indian Army or Indian scientists is a heinous crime. No Prime Minister of independent India has claimed credit for such feats in the past. During the Indo-Pak. conflict, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi conducted herself with remarkable dignity. Atal Bihari Vajpayee carried out India’s second nuclear test at Pokhran and brought Pakistan to its knees in the decisive Kargil war. But never did they claim credit the way Mr. Modi is doing now. The tone and tenor of Mr. Modi does not augur well for the post he is holding. But has it succeeded in stemming what some thought was building up to an ‘anti-Modi’ wave? It is precisely because he is seeing this kind of a wave himself that Mr. Modi is trying to push a nationalist agenda. But people will not be carried away by theatrics. Mr. Modi refuses to reply on the Rafale deal in the Parliament. Does it not show people that Mr. Modi has something to hide? What is your counter- narrative? Congress and JD(S) in Karnataka will raise issues of unemployment, rural distress, destabilising constitutional institutions, misuse of offices of the Central Bureau of Investigation and the like. Search and seizure operation by I-T [officials] on those said to be linked to JD(S) and Congress, when polls to the Lok Sabha are round the corner, is testimony to Mr. Modi’s vendetta politics. No Prime Minister in independent India had stooped this low. BJP leaders are terming theMahagathbandhanthe ‘Tukde-Tukdegang’, ‘Mahamilawat’ etc, pointing to a lack of cohesion. BJP primarily has no moral right to criticise the coming together of parties under a common umbrella. Have they not aligned with regional parties like All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) in Tamil Nadu or Shiv Sena in Maharashtra? As Prime Minister, Mr. Modi should maintain a certain decorum while speaking. This language comes out of desperation. But there are strains and opposing pulls within the formation. It was JD(S) which initiated the process of mahagathbandhanby bringing together all anti-Modi and anti-BJP forces in the country during the oath-taking ceremony of Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy. Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leader Chandrababu Naidu tried his best to stitch an alliance between the Congress and other anti-BJP parties. But some anti-BJP parties are preparing a solo fight in their own States. This cannot be construed astukde-tukde (bits and pieces). This is nothing but an attempt by the BJP to humiliate regional parties for which they will pay a price. As far as I am concerned I will support any regional party which opposes BJP. Do you think people will trust the alliance as a possible national alternative, despite disappointments in the past? Parties opposed to Mr. Modi in each State will naturally have their own plans. After the polls, they would decide on the leadership. I have appealed to them in the past and will appeal to them again that the most important thing is to convince people that we can give a stable government for five years. I am optimistic.

Opposition gets a week for VVPAT reply|NEW DELHI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Supreme Court on Monday asked 21 Opposition parties to respond by April 8 to an Election Commission affidavit that states that increasing random physical verification using VVPAT to 50% would delay the Lok Sabha poll results of 2019 by six whole days. A Bench led by Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi, in a short hearing, agreed to a request made by senior advocate A.M. Singhvi for time to submit, in writing, the Opposition’s response to the EC’s affidavit. “The 50% Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slip verification in each Assembly segment of a parliamentary constituency or Assembly constituency on an average shall enlarge the time required for counting to about six days,” the EC said in a 50-page affidavit filed last week. Observing that the current confidence level in EVM-VVPAT accuracy was 99.9936%, the ECI said any increase in the sample size of verification of VVPAT slips would only lead to a “very negligible gain in the confidence level”. The ECI said the adoption of a particular percentage as a sample for VVPAT verification was devoid of scientific logic or statistical basis. In fact, it was “otiose” (would serve no practical purpose). The Commission stood its ground despite the court’s recent strong observations in favour of an increase in the sample VVPAT slip counting for the Lok Sabha election. The 21 Opposition parties jointly moved the court challenging the EC guideline that VVPAT slip counting would take place only in one polling station in an Assembly constituency or each Assembly segment in case of the Lok Sabha election. ISI report The EC is banking on a March 22 report of the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) to buttress its case against increasing the sample size for counting VVPAT slips. The ISI report recommends that a sample verification of 479 EVMs and VVPATs out of a total 10.35 lakh machines would lift confidence to 99.9936%. Deputy Election Commissioner Sudeep Jain, who authored the affidavit, however, wrote that the EC’s sample verification for the Lok Sabha polls would cover 4,125 EVMs and VVPATs. “This is 8.6 times the sample size recommended in the Indian Statistical Institute report.” The poll panel, represented by senior advocate Aryama Sundaram and advocate Amit Sharma, submitted that no mismatch had been detected during mock polls, or in the verification of VVPAT slips carried out at 1,500 polling stations till date. The EC said increased VVPAT slip counting would require extensive training and capacity building of election officials in the field. VVPAT slip counting takes place in specially erected VVPAT counting booths under the close monitoring of the returning officer and with direct oversight by the observer.

Voters will punish Congress for ‘Hindu terror’ slur: Modi|Wardha|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|In his first campaign rally in Maharashtra for the 2019 general election, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday criticised the Congress for coining the term ‘Hindu terror’. He added that the community would teach the Congress a fitting lesson for the slur. “The Congress and the NCP can stoop to the lowest level for the sake of vote-bank politics. The Congress attempted to defame the crores of Indians by using the term ‘Hindu terror’,” he said at a rally in Wardha in the Vidarbha region. The Bharatiya Janata Party’s Ramdas Tadas is seeking re-election from the Wardha constituency, taking on Charulata Tokas of the Congress. Aseemanand verdict Alluding to the Samjhauta Express blast case verdict, which acquitted Swami Aseemanand, without however specifically referring to the case, Mr. Modi said it had exposed the conspiracy hatched by the Congress. “How can the Congress be forgiven for insulting the Hindus in front of the world? Weren’t you hurt when you heard the word ‘Hindu terror’? How can a community known for peace, brotherhood and harmony be linked with terrorism? In the thousand years of history, not a single incident shows an act of Hindu terrorism. Even the British historians could never find it,” the Prime Minister said. Claiming that it was Sushil Kumar Shinde, who as Union Home Minister used the term, Mr. Modi said the Congress-NCP government in Maharashtra had given a free hand to the crowd in Azad Maidan, which went on the rampage destroying the memorial of martyrs. Balakot card Issuing a stern warning to the Congress, Mr. Modi said the Hindu community was aware now. Using innuendo, Mr. Modi said, “It is evident from the fact that one has to contest a seat where the minority is majority,” alluding to the decision of Congress president Rahul Gandhi — without naming him — to contest Kerala’s Wayanad, in addition to Amethi. Repeating his tirade against the Congress for seeking evidence of the IAF’s strikes in Balakot, Pakistan, Mr. Modi urged the crowd, “Do you want heroes of Hindustan or of Pakistan? You wantsaboot[evidence] orsapoot[great son]? Teach those who ask for evidence a lesson.”

Congress accuses Shah of falsifying poll affidavit|New Delhi|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Congress on Monday accused BJP president Amit Shah of ‘undervaluing’ one of the properties mentioned in his affidavit and demanded that the Election Commission direct the Returning Officer of Gandhinagar to take ‘appropriate’ action. Former Union Minister Manish Tewari told presspersons that a plot in Gandhinagar, which has a market value of Rs. 66.5 lakh based on government guidelines, had been declared by the BJP chief at a value of Rs. 25 lakh. Observing that ‘undervaluation’ of one’s assets in an election affidavit was a serious matter, Mr. Tewari said such an act violated the provisions of the Representation of the People Act (RPA). He said that Section 125-A of the RPA clearly states that “a candidate who fails to provide full information or provides false information or conceals any information, will be punishable with fine and/or imprisonment”. “We would like the Election Commission to take cognisance of this matter and direct the Returning Officer of Gandhinagar to take appropriate action under the law,” Mr. Tewari said. “This is no ordinary candidate, this is the president of the BJP and an alleged false declaration on an affidavit is a serious issue,” he added. ‘Achhe dinfor some’ The Congress leader said that despite a laid-down process, the BJP president had decided to declare the property at less than half its market value. Mr. Tewari also questioned the threefold jump in Mr. Shah’s assets between 2012 and 2019 — the assets had grown from Rs. 11.79 crore to Rs. 38.81 crore. “At least, for some,achhe din[good days] have come even if they have not come for 125 crore Indians,” he quipped, mocking the BJP’s campaign slogan for the 2014 election.

Handloom at the movies|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|A couple of days afterViswasamreleased in January, Anu Vardhan was fielding calls from fans who wanted the vibrant checked handloom silk-cotton saris that Nayanthara wore in the film. She couldn’t place orders fast enough with weavers in Kancheepuram and Periyapalayam to recreate the six yards in combinations of fuchsia and purple. “The same people I had trouble convincing to make Chettinad checks earlier were now getting orders from big stores. That’s the impact of what you see in movies,” says the stylist/designer. Then, in February, in Seenu Ramasamy’sKanne Kalaimaane,Tamannaah, who played a Saurashtrian hailing from a family of weavers, was draped in elegant saris sourced from Co-optex. It was a conscious choice, says the director, who grew up among weavers. “I wanted to encourage handloom, and I thought this was a great way to do it. Did you know a person has to move his feet and hands 18,000 times to weave a garment? I wanted to showcase the result of that hard work, which is why the camera focusses on name tags — who wove it, how many hours it took,” he says. Six-yard statement Handlooms aren’t new in Tamil cinema — we’ve seen gorgeous cottons and silks on Balu Mahendra, K Balachander and Mani Ratnam heroines. But in the last two years, the choice seems to be more mindful. “There has been a general revival of handloom culture, with initiatives by the Crafts Council of India,” says Poornima Ramasamy, a National Award-winning designer. “Celebrities across industries, from Vidya Balan to Jyotika and Nayanthara, are wearing a lot of handloom and, in the corporate world too, women are wearing saris. So real life is influencing the reel.” Conscious change Needless to say, the character’s role in the film influences the costume designer’s choice. “InViswasam, Nayanthara played a doctor from Mumbai, who comes down to conduct medical camps. I felt she must be a socially-conscious person,” says Anu, who began looking at handloom because she feels strongly about sustainable, environmentally-conscious fashion. “When [director] Siva narrated the story, he talked about the joint family culture and that brought to mind my early days in Pudukkottai, when my grandmother dressed in Chettinad checks. So I chose colours and saris that connected with my roots.” The 2018 Vishal-Samantha starrer,Irumbu Thirai, was as loved for the fact that it did not force-feed audiences a romance angle, as for Samantha’s (who played a psychiatrist) impeccable linen and cotton weaves. “Earlier, these fabrics were reserved for older characters. But cotton has a certain appeal,” says Hyderabad-based designer/stylist Neeraja Kona, who shops mainly in Jaipur for its easy access to block printers and in villages near her home town of Bapatla, Andhra Pradesh. Then there was Hemanika, the Bharatanatyam dancer (played by Trisha) from Gautham Vasudev Menon’sYennai Arindhaal(2015). Her stunning look was courtesy the director’s sister, Uttara Menon. “We had time to ideate the character. I made dresses out of Kanchi cottons and used retro brocade for her dance costumes,” she says, while Gautham adds, “For Hemanika, I visualised a mild arrogance — this is a girl whose life is dance.” A natural fit This quiet focus on handloom is being seen across the border, too. In Telugu, Indrakshi Pattanaik’s work inMahanati(2018), Nag Ashwin’s biopic on actor Savitri, came in for appreciation. The Delhi-based designer sourced a lot of stuff from the Telangana State Handloom Weavers’ Cooperative Society (TSCO). “I used organic cotton and Khadi for saris, and also for the background,” she says, adding that she prefers handloom because “it has a certain purity that’s endearing.” While using handloom might increase the costumes budget (often between five and 10 times), directors and producers are slowly opening up to the idea. “It also helps that the artistes cooperate. They want to wear something they know will make a positive impact, and when they showcase them, it creates a new market for natural fabrics,” says Anu, who is styling Nayanthara in her upcoming films with Rajinikanth and Vijay. And yes, we will see more handlooms. With inputs from Surya Praphulla Kumar  My taste in fabrics comes from the women in my family; I’ve seen them wear a lot of handloom. I’ve always wanted the women in my films to look real. And finally, it’s about the magic that happens when the director, actor, costume designer and art director are on one page, and you get a cinematographer who understands that  There’s been a general revival of handloom and weavers’ clusters; people are realising it is wonderful to wear. Then, there are initiatives by the Crafts Council of India to promote handloom, and celebrities across industries are wearing a lot of it, too. Even in the corporate world, women are wearing saris. So real life is influencing the reel

Nature’s way|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|April 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Coimbatore Parenting Network (CPN), a peer support group on Facebook, has over 7,000 members. Swati Jagdish, a group administrator, talks about how discussions around parenting are changing, right from birth. “Parents are exploring alternative schooling methods for their children, people are moving to traditional and organic diets, and the same is happening with birthing,” she says. “We want to go back to Nature.” This is against the background of women gaining authority over their own bodies. The growing awareness on alternative birthing practices is just one of the many reasons why women are opting for natural birthing. There is a lot of information available on social media related to this, that helps women make an informed birth choice. Drawing from experience Swati draws on her own experience: “I was shocked when I was asked to take progesterone suppositories (which are recommended only for someone with a history of miscarriages). That decided it for me, and at 16 weeks, I decided to go to the Birth Village, a natural birthing centre in Kochi. They clarified my doubts and assured me that there was a super-speciality hospital within five kilometres reach in the case of an emergency. Most importantly, they treat an expectant mother with dignity and respect.” Haritha P, who holds ante-natal classes and is a lactation counsellor at her centre Thalir in Madurai, says natural birthing is a normal physiological process that can be achieved without any medical intervention in the case of a healthy woman. “Millions of women, starting with our own great grandmothers have given birth with the help of abai. Now, there are midwives. For my first child, I had to undergo an emergency C-section. For my second child, I came up with a birthing plan from day one, as I was clear about a vaginal birth. At 36 weeks, the hospital ruled out a normal delivery, as my scan report showed that the baby weight wouldn’t allow it. With just two more weeks to go, I convinced my family, and over Skype, consulted with the Birth Village.” Harita did end up having a natural birth. Questioning the system Pregnant women have started asking the right questions and that is driving the change, says Swati. “They are aware of the birth plan that the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends. They also know that they can say no to an epidural or episiotomy. Most hospitals will listen if you start asking questions.” A woman must know her rights, says Haritha. “An expectant mother has the right to give or withhold her consent for anything from an IV drip to an epidural. She has to be aware of the risks, benefits and alternatives that are available. Support and awareness among extended family also matter.” There are a number of informative videos on YouTube that throw light on the subject: the ‘breast crawl’ videos of the WHO and UNICEF highlight the skin-to-skin contact between the newborn and mother that is recommended immediately after birthing. There are helpful books as well. “In Dr Marsden Wagner’s book,Creating Your Birth Plan,theauthor cites the unnecessary reasons recommending C-section births. But there are those doctors like Dr Fatima Poonawala in Bengaluru, who stick to a birth plan and carry out only natural birthing without any interventions,” says Swati, who runs Bond & Beyond, a centre for pregnancy health, lactation and post-partum counselling. A professionaldoulasupports and assists in labour. Anupama Vijay Anand is one. She also conducts ante-natal classes at her centre, Vriksham, Coimbatore. “Doulasact as a bridge between the doctor and to-be parents. I insist the husband be trained too and be a birthing partner.” With the father also establishing a close connect to the child during birthing, it helps him stay connected post-partum too. Durghesh Nandini, who blogs about her natural-birthing experience, says the main difference between hospital birthing and a birth-centre birthing is education. “I opted for lotus birth and delayed the cord cutting for my second child. The umbilical cord is allowed to fall off naturally.”  The other view A midwife-delivery is fine in a hospital environment, but one has to be aware of risks at home, warns gynaecologist Dr Asha Rao, Director, Rao Hospital, Coimbatore. “If there is an emergency, there should be a doctor at hand,” she says. “Home deliveries worked in the olden days as lifestyles were different. Women did a lot of work, bending, sweeping, and squatting. Now, we are not doing as much physical work and the movement of the baby down the birth passage is not that easy,” she says. She adds that complications have increased, with more women having babies in their later years, and the rise in the incidence of lifestyle diseases such as diabetes and PCOD. Dr Rao feels that obstetrics works better under centralised care, where there is a complete support system. “It is a better option that is geared up in case of complications in the mother or the child.”  A bigger heart  A woman’s blood volume increases and her heart grows bigger during pregnancy. This ensures that there is enough oxygenated blood supplied to the foetus.

Why manifestos of TDP and YSRCP are a ‘secret’|G.V.R. Subba Rao|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Typically, political parties scramble to complete their manifestos on time so they can use them to woo voters. But it would appear that nothing is typical about the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP), both of whom are holding to their manifestos for dear life even as the elections are barely 10 days away. Both the TDP and the YSRCP have their manifestos ready, but each is waiting for the other to release their document first. This ‘wait-and-respond’ approach seems to have been prompted by the fear that their rival might ‘copy’ their ideas. Even before the election schedule was announced, the TDP government had hiked pensions to Rs. 2,000. The YSR Congress Party then claimed that the TDP had stolen the idea of a pension hike from his ‘Navaratnalu’, a document released at the party’s annual meeting. Telangana suspense In neighbouring Telangana, too, there was a suspense for days, and finally, when they released their respective manifestos, the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) and the Congress accused each other of copying their “offers.” But for the TDP and the YSRCP, all other parties in Andhra Pradesh, including the Jana Sena Party (JSP), the BJP, the Congress, the Communist Party of India (CPI), the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI-M) and the Praja Shanti Party have released their manifestos. Raining sops Instead of releasing their manifestos, YSR Congress president Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu have both been busy announcing sops at their public meetings across the State. While ensuring that no section is left out, they have been specifically targeting pensioners, Backward Classes (BCs), women and farmers. Mr. Naidu, during his campaign, made 10 major promises, including a special bank for the Backward Classes (BCs) with a capital of Rs. 10,000 crore. On the other hand, Mr. Reddy sought to win the hearts of the unemployed by promising to fill 2.3 lakh job vacancies. Houses, more houses When the Opposition leader promised that 25 lakh houses would be constructed for the poor, Mr. Naidu promised that 20 lakh new houses would be constructed in addition to the 30 lakh houses that are under construction. And the battle of promises goes on. Meanwhile, the manifestos remain hidden.

‘My fight is against the politics of polarisation’|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Former JNU students’ union president and CPI candidateKanhaiya Kumaris pitted against BJP leader and Union Minister Giriraj Singh in Begusarai, known as the ‘Leningrad of Bihar’ for the sizeable number of communist party supporters across caste lines. Both Mr. Kumar and Mr. Singh are from the dominant upper caste Bhumihar community but their politics represent two poles. Talking over several cups of tea outside his concrete-and-thatched single-storey house at Bihat-Maslanpur village, Mr. Kumar portrayed the contest as one between truth and falsehood and a battle to protect the Constitution and democratic institutions.Excerpts: Whom do you consider as your contender? BJP candidate Giriraj Singh or grand alliance (RJD) candidate Tanveer Hassan? I do not consider either of them as my contender. My fight is not against any individual but an ideology: against that ideology which talks about politics of polarisation, divisiveness, attacking constitution and slamming democratic institutions. It’s a contest betweenhaq aur loot;saach aur jhoot(rights and loot; truth and lies). How do you see BJP’s development, patriotism, Pulwama and Balakot air strike issues in the campaign? We all know about BJP’s propaganda politics. Divisive politics. If they were so sure about all these things to reap electoral dividend, then why did they go for alliances with the Shiv Sena and the JD (U) on these parties’ terms? Patriotism and our soldiers’ bravery should not come into politics. It is always there for every Indian to salute but politicising it, I think, must be condemned. The BJP’s slander campaign of “anti-national” and “fake news” cannot be approved by any right thinking Indian. By raising Pulwama terror strike and Balakot air strike they have hatched a conspiracy to hide their failures… the promises they made during the last election to the people of the country. But why should the people of Begusarai vote for you? Because I’m the son of the soil and, unlike the BJP candidate, I’m not being imported. You can well understand why Giriraj Singh was reluctant to contest from Begusarai for over a week… he must be feeling threatened. People of Begusarai would vote for me for their voice to be heard in Delhi against all the hate politics, politics of intimidation, oppression; for participatory democracy and social cohesion, inclusiveness. Why did themahagathbandhanrefuse to field you as candidate, despite a grand welcome accorded to you, by both RJD chief Lalu Prasad and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, earlier? I’ve no idea at all. But, I’ve no grudges against anyone. I’m here to contest the election with an open mind and clear agenda. The people of Begusarai are politically so mature that they know and understand everything. They’re ready to break all myths in this election: about caste, chemistry, calculations and propaganda. Begusarai has never been a BJP stronghold… only in 2014, the BJP candidate had won the seat. But, it’s been a traditional stronghold of communists, Left ideologies. And, despite its Left ideology there has never been a caste massacre here as was earlier happening in districts of central Bihar. Why? Because, people here are well aware and politically educated… it’s not that only the lower caste people are Left supporters in Begusarai, but most of them come from upper caste Bhumihar community. Do you think coming from the Bhumihar community will help you in the election? Not really, why to single out the Bhumihar caste only. I’m getting support from everyone, every caste and community. It’s my constituency, they all are my people, whether Muslims or Hindus. But, how can I discard this social fact, that I’m born in a Bhumihar family?  How different is it from contesting the JNU students’ union election? JNU is beyond an academic institution. It gives you space to learn freely from social movements, consciousness and even from your own life. It was there that my activism flourished and it changed my life’s ambition. When I was contesting for students’ union president I had no idea that I would get such an overwhelming response and win the poll. Contesting Lok Sabha poll also is not very different from it... I’m meeting people here every day and hope to get that “overwhelming” response from them to win this poll as well. Were you to win, what would be your priorities? I will keep raising my voice against politics of hatred and intimidation; to take politics out of the pockets of the rich and powerful and give it to those common people who pay taxes so that the governments run. People should be the master... We’ll speak for the state of public equality, education, healthcare and infrastructure. We’ll vouch for alternative politics to be accountable and transparent.  How much money have you collected through crowdfunding? In three days, the initiative had collected over Rs. 30 lakh but suddenly a cyberattack took place and the website stopped opening… The target is to collect Rs. 70 lakh as per EC guidelines.  It’s a contest betweenhaq aur loot;saach aur jhoot(rights and loot; truth and lies)

Writers appeal against hate politics|PANAJI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Over 200 writers across the country have issued a signed appeal, saying, “Let us vote against hate politics. Let us vote for an equal and diverse India.” Among the signatories are Amitav Ghosh, Romila Thapar, Arundhati Roy, Jerry Pinto, Keki Daruwalla, Harsh Mander, Ranjit Hoskote, R. Unni, Anand Teltumbde, Zoya Hasan and Girish Karnad. They include those writing in Hindi, English, Punjabi, Marathi, Gujarati, Bangla, Malayalam, Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, Urdu, Kashmiri and Konkani. The statement was released by email on Monday by K. Satchidanandan and Githa Hariharan on behalf of the Indian Writers’ Forum. The statement said: “The upcoming election finds our country at the crossroads. Our Constitution guarantees all its citizens equal rights, the freedom to eat, pray and live as they choose, freedom of expression and the right to dissent. But in the last few years, we have seen citizens being lynched or assaulted or discriminated against because of their community, caste, gender, or the region they come from. “Hate politics has been used to divide the country; create fear; and exclude more and more people from living as full-fledged citizens. Writers, artists, filmmakers, musicians and other cultural practitioners have been hounded, intimidated, and censored. Anyone who questions the powers-that-be is in danger of being harassed or arrested on false and ridiculous charges. “All of us want this to change. We don’t want rationalists, writers, and activists to be hounded or assassinated. We want stern measures against violence in word or deed against women, Dalits, Adivasis and minority communities. We want resources and measures for jobs, education, research, healthcare and equal opportunities for all... Vote out the division of our people; vote out inequality; vote against violence, intimidation, and censorship. This is the only way we can vote for an India that renews the promises made by our Constitution. This is why we appeal to all citizens to vote for a diverse and equal India.”

April, May to be warmer than normal, says IMD|NEW DELHI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Citizens heading out to vote during the Lok Sabha election will have to brace for hotter weather. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has said that the average maximum temperatures from April to June are likely to be warmer by half a degree in several places in central and northwest India. “The season averaged maximum temperatures are likely to be warmer than normal by 0.5C-1C over Haryana, Chandigarh & Delhi, west & east Uttar Pradesh, west & east Rajasthan, west & east Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Gujarat, Madhya Maharashtra, Vidarbha, Marathawada, coastal Karnataka, north interior Karnataka, Rayalaseema and Telangana. Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sub Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim, Assam and Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram & Tripura are likely to be warmer than normal by more than 1C,” the IMD said in a statement on Tuesday. The forecast is in line with the IMD’s position in March, when it said March-May would be “warmer” than normal. ‘Normal’ temperatures refer to the mean temperatures during these months between 1981 and 2010. El Nino impact The El Niño, an anomalous heating of the Central Pacific that occurs once in three-five years and linked to droughts in India, may be playing a role. “Current observations suggest weak El Niño conditions. The latest forecast indicates that these conditions are likely to persist during April-June,” the statement added.

In battle for Begusarai, the charge of the young gun|Begusarai|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|“This time, we will vote for local boy Kanhaiya Kumar,” Dilip Sharma, 45, says. Mr. Sharma lives in Bihat-Maslanpur village of Begusarai, the Lok Sabha constituency where the CPI has fielded the former JNU Students’ Union president against firebrand BJP leader and Union Minister Giriraj Singh. Mr. Singh was reluctant to contest after the BJP swapped his Nawada seat with the Lok Janshakti Party. Mr. Kumar and Mr. Singh come from the upper caste Bhumihar community which, with a 4.5 lakh population, is a dominant caste in the constituency. There is a sizeable number of Muslim (2.5 lakh), Yadav (80,000) and Extremely Backward Caste (about 1 lakh) voters. In 2014, BJP candidate Bhola Prasad Singh won here, defeating RJD candidate Tanveer Hassan by over 60,000 votes. Mr. Hassan, again in the poll ring on RJD ticket, hopes to win the seat with the possible split of the Bhumihar votes between his two rivals. Begusarai is known as the ‘Leningrad of Bihar’ as it has a sizeable number of CPI supporters across caste lines. In 2014, the BJP got 39.73% of the votes, RJD 34.32% and CPI candidate Rajendra Prasad 17.87%. Yogendra Sharma of the CPI had won the seat in 1967. The Congress, the RJD and the JD(U) have been bagging the seat, but the Left vote bank has been intact with its candidates coming at second or third position. “Left supporters and sympathisers across the country have been keenly watching the electoral battle of Begusarai,” political analyst Ajay Kumar toldThe Hindu. All Left parties in the State have extended their support to Mr. Kumar. “Like in Nawada, the BJP tried to incite communal tension in Muslim areas such as Ballia, Rosera, Pokharia, Patel Chowk and Bathauli of Begusarai too, but we reached these places in time and foiled their plot. We underlined that Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Christians all are brothers,” Mr. Kumar toldThe Hinduon Saturday. “We’ll not allow Singh to make Begusarai another Nawada where politics has been completely polarised,” Surendra Sharma, a farmer at Teghra, said. After being denied ticket for Nawada, Mr. Singh had been sulking in Delhi, saying, “I fail to understand why among all Union Ministers from Bihar only my constituency was changed.” However, after party chief Amit Shah assuaged his “hurt feelings”, Mr. Singh landed in Patna and rushed to meet Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. The next day he was in Begusarai and kicked off his campaign in his inimitable style. “My fight is against anti-nationals… those leaders who are asking the Centre for proof of India’s air strike against Pakistan are not connected with ground realities… I am sure the people of Begusarai will give them a befitting reply,” he said. A group of JNU alumni and Independent MLA from Vadgam (Gujarat) Jignesh Mevani, along with popular YouTuber Wali Rahmani, are camping in Begusarai and canvassing for Mr. Kumar.

‘Create an ecosystem for rural entrepreneurship’|Bhubaneswar|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST| Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu on Monday advocated for creating an ecosystem for entrepreneurship to thrive in rural India. “The possible way to address unemployment is to create the right ecosystem for youngsters to become entrepreneurs and set up their own businesses,” Mr. Naidu said addressing a summit here on “Empowering Young Grampreneurs to Create Jobs”.

Rahul a habitual liar, says Shivraj Chouhan|NEW DELHI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has accused Congress president Rahul Gandhi of being a “habitual liar”, referring to the farm loan waiver promised by the Congress during the recent Assembly election in Madhya Pradesh. Mr. Chouhan said Mr. Gandhi had claimed during the Assembly election campaign that the Congress would waive farmers’ loans within 10 days of coming to power in the State. Even after 104 days of Kamal Nath taking over as Chief Minister, this was not fulfilled, he said. “Rahul Gandhi speaks lies with confidence and shamelessly. He is a habitual liar,” Mr. Chouhan said. He showed photocopies of messages purportedly from the State government and received by farmers stating that the loan waiver exercise was put on hold due to the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) that came into effect after the general election announcement. He added that the MCC was not applicable to ongoing schemes and as such the government could have gone ahead with it if it wanted.

‘Nirav tried to get Vanuatu citizenship’|NEW DELHI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Nirav Modi, the Punjab National Bank fraud case accused, had applied for citizenship of Vanuatu, a South Pacific Ocean nation located close to Australia. However, the Vanuatuan authorities turned down his request submitted in December 2017, said the Enforcement Directorate (ED) sources. “A week ago, we were informed about it,” said a senior official on condition of anonymity.  Indian agencies have also found out that after the Central Bureau of Investigation and the ED registered cases against Mr. Modi and others, he made 12 employees operating from Dubai and Hong Kong shift to Cairo, in the name of lucrative prospects. “The employees had been made dummy directors in the shell companies controlled by him abroad,” the official said. The employees were kept in two bungalows in the suburbs of Cairo for about four-five months. On the pretext of arranging jobs for them, their passports were taken away by Mr. Modi’s close associate Subhash Parab. Mr. Modi had allegedly got the mobile phones of these employees destroyed in Dubai. Over a period of time, 11 employees managed to fly out of Cairo. The ED has recorded the statements of nine, while two are now said to be in Dubai.

Bastar police plan to outdo tactical campaign of Maoists|Jagdalpur|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The April 11 election in the Bastar Lok Sabha constituency comes at a challenging time for security forces as Maoists are on the tactical counter-offensive campaign they take up from February to June every year, Vivekanand Sinha, Inspector-General of Police, Bastar range, says. “Maoist activity picks up around April when the collection oftenduleaves begins. Extorting money from tribal leaf collectors is a major source of revenue for them [the Maoists],” he says. This time, Maoists reportedly organised meetings with villagers on the periphery of Sukma, Bijapur and Dantewada districts to urge them to abstain from voting. “Wherever such meetings have been reportedly held, we have sent in teams for area domination and confidence-building among villagers,” Mr. Sinha says. The police have roped in 300 volunteers from the six districts of the range to encourage people to vote. “Based on the results of such efforts during the recent Assembly election, we have given the election special emphasis under community policing. Each district has a programme with a particular name. For instance, the one in Bastar is calledAmcho Police, Amcho Bastar,” he says. At every checkpost on the highways passing through the region, security personnel are filming vehicle checks. “This is to ensure transparency and avoid complaints of harassment,” Mr. Sinha says. While some polling officials will walk to remote booths, many others in districts other than Dantewada will be airlifted. As the possibility of inter-State Maoist movement looms large, the police have deployed troops along the State boundaries. Troops from various regions are arriving in the range every day, and 350 companies of 75-80 personnel each will be deployed during the election. “Those who have been called from other parts are given a week’s special training before being deployed on the field,” he said. The troops are being accommodated in existing camps, and hence schools are not being closed. Security cover has been provided to the candidates based on the threat level and place of campaigning. On the Congress claim that Maoist violence was declining under its rule in Chhattisgarh, Mr. Sinha said it was too early to say that since the new government was formed only in December and the period of a possible increase in Maoist activity had just begun.

Facebook purges pages for ‘coordinated’ fake behaviour|NEW DELHI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|With less than two weeks before India goes to the polls, Facebook said it had removed more than 700 pages and accounts in India for “coordinated inauthentic behaviour” including 687 linked to an IT cell of the Congress party. The other 15 pages, groups and accounts that were taken down were associated with an Indian IT firm Silver Touch, which does a bulk of its work for the NDA government. The Congress, however, said that none of the party’s verified Facebook accounts had been removed by the social media giant. “No official pages run by INC have been taken down,” the Congress tweeted on its official handle. “Additionally, all pages run by our verified volunteers are also unaffected. In the mean time, we are awaiting a response from Facebook to provide us a list of all pages/accounts that they have taken down.” In a blogpost, Facebook’s Head of Cybersecurity Policy Nathaniel Gleicher wrote that the people behind these pages and accounts coordinated with one another and used fake accounts to misrepresent themselves, while stressing that they were removed on the basis of their behaviour, not the content they posted. Interestingly, the 687 pages and accounts linked to individuals connected an an IT cell of the Congress spent the rupee equivalent of about $39,000 for ads on Facebook between August 2014 and March 2019, while the 15 accounts and pages associated with Silver Touch spent about $70,000 (in rupees) on ads between June 2014 and February 2019.

SC questions Assam over untraced immigrants|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The hearing saw the court ask questions on a series of connected issues. “What percentage of illegal migrants have you proceeded against? What are you doing to improve the conditions of those detained in the detention centres? How long will they remain,” the Chief Justice asked. The absence of the Assam Chief Secretary in court to personally answer these questions irked the Bench. “Where is the Chief Secretary,” the CJI asked Mr. Mehta. “He was here the last time. Who exempted him from personal appearance this time? Does he get to decide that he need not come?” The Chief Justice said the “Government of Assam is playing around with the court.” “Your affidavits are an exercise in futility,” the CJI remarked. “We are doing our best,” Mr. Mehta responded. “If this is your best, then you permit us to pass our orders in full exercise of our constitutional powers,” Chief Justice Gogoi retorted. Finally, the court drew a personal undertaking from Mr. Mehta that the Assam Chief Secretary would be present in court on April 8, the next date of hearing, and only return to Assam after getting permission from the court. The court is hearing a petition filed by activist Harsh Mander about the dismal living conditions within the four walls of the detention centres in the State. It noticed that many detainees continue to be lodged inside these centres even after the expiry of their term of imprisonment for illegally entering the country.

Leopard cub rescued from Mumbai suburb|Mumbai|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|A leopard who had entered a housing society, Woodland Crest, near Vijay Nagar in Marol on Monday morning, was rescued by forest officials after four hours of struggle. The big cat was first spotted in the adjoining building, Woodland Avenue, around 9.30 a.m. “I was taking a photo of the car, when I saw a creature, who I assumed was a stray dog. When I tried to shoo it away, the creature came out, and then I realised that it was a leopard,” Suresh Shinde, a resident of the building, said. Mr. Shinde raised the alarm. The building’s watchman, Mohit Lal, said he tried to hit the leopard with a stick to shoo it away after which it jumped into Woodland Crest. Security guard alerted Rajesh Yadav, who runs a juice stall across the road, happened to be near the gate of Woodland Crest, and saw the leopard enter the building. “I alerted the security guard, who then informed residents,” Mr. Yadav said. According to Mahavir Rambhia, a Woodland Crest resident, he was informed about the animal around 10 a.m.. “I probably missed the leopard as I left for some work around 9.30 a.m. As soon I was told by my wife I came home and stood outside the building. All residents were told to stay indoors and no one was allowed in,” he said. Beneath stairs The eight-storey building has just one entry and exit point, and the leopard had taken shelter beneath the stairs on the ground floor. The police and the forest department were called in, and residents were asked not to venture out of their homes. A team from the forest department and Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) arrived around 11.30 a.m.. “Our primary responsibility was the safety of the residents and the animal as well. We needed to ensure the location of the leopard and then lay a trap,” Dr. Jitendra Ramagaonkar, Deputy Conservator of Forests, said. Portion of grille cut The rescue team cut a portion of a grille on the first floor to enter the home and then cordoned off the ground floor area near the lift. Yogendra Satam and his brother Yogesh, who are constables with the Mumbai Police and live in the police camp nearby, were part of the rescue operation. “We first checked whether the leopard was on any staircase between the ground and the first floor after which we decided to cut the grille and enter from the first floor,” Yogendra said. Around 2 p.m., the leopard was tranquilised and the operation was completed by 2.15 p.m. Dr. Shailesh Pethe, veterinary officer, SGNP, said the leopard was male and his age was between one and two years. “In all likelihood he came looking for food. They often seek stray dogs as they are easy prey,” he said. After the animal’s capture, forest officials said it was fit and showed no signs of any injury or dehydration. “The cub is under observation and should be released into the wild by Tuesday,” a senior forest official said.

Hardik moves SC for stay on conviction|NEW DELHI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Congress leader Hardik Patel on Monday moved the Supreme Court for anex partestay on his conviction in the 2015 Vispur rioting case. On March 29, the Gujarat High Court declined his plea to suspend his conviction. On July 25, 2018, the Sessions Court at Visnagar in Mehsana district sentenced Mr. Patel to two years in jail. It found him guilty of rioting and arson in the town during the Patidar quota agitation of 2015. Under the election law, a candidate facing two years or more in jail is disqualified unless the conviction is stayed. The High Court suspended the sentence in August 2018, but not the conviction. Mr. Patel, 25, is preparing to contest Jamnagar after joining the Congress on March 12. The last date for filing of nominations is April 4.

BSF officer, girl killed in Pak. shelling|Jammu/Srinagar|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|A BSF officer and a five-year-old girl were killed on Monday as Pakistani troops resorted to heavy shelling on forward areas along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir’s Poonch district, officials said. Eleven persons, including six soldiers, were injured. Sobia (5) was killed and two persons suffered injuries when a shell exploded near their house in a village in Shahpur sub-sector, the officials said. Pakistan used heavy weaponry and 120 mm mortar bombs to target civilian areas in Poonch. Earlier in the day, three civilians — Mohammad Sharief Magray, Haniefa Bi and Shoukat Hussain — and an Army man guarding a forward post in Mankote were injured in the intense shelling, the officials said. Search operation Four militants were killed while three Army jawans and a police personnel were injured in an encounter in Pulwama district of Jammu and Kashmir on Monday, police said. On a tip-off, security forces launched a cordon and search operation at Lassipora in Pulwama district. During the searches, militants fired upon the forces. The fire was retaliated, leading to an encounter.

In abode of the clouds, coal sparks livelihood versus ecology debate|SHILLONG|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Jostina Dkhar, 40, fears the day the interim relief she received for her dead son Dimonme gets exhausted. Her elder son Melambok lies buried deep inside a flooded rat-hole coal mine at Ksan, about 21 km from her village Lumthari in Meghalaya’s East Jaintia Hills district. The 20-year-old Dimonme’s decomposed body was one of the two retrieved from the Ksan mine, where at least 15 miners have been trapped since December 31. Multiple agencies have since been extracting water from a network of coal pits in a bid to retrieve the bodies, but the water level has hardly changed. Ksan, or Khloo Ryngksan, and Lumthari are within the Sutnga-Saipung, one of the 36 Assembly segment of the mineral-rich Shillong Lok Sabha constituency, from where Congress MP Vincent Pala is seeking a victory for the third straight term. The ailing Ms. Dkhar, whose husband abandoned her 10 years ago, wishes she knew a trade to sustain and educate her two minor daughters. Her family has been too dependent on coal — almost an illicit commodity in the region since April 2014 when the National Green Tribunal (NGT) banned rat-hole mining — while effluents from the mines poisoned the farmlands around. She is unaware that the plight of families like hers has become an issue for debate ahead of the election to Meghalaya’s two Lok Sabha seats. The other seat is Tura, which is witnessing the battle of the Sangmas — National People’s Party (NPP) candidate and former Union Minister Agatha Sangma versus former Chief Minister Mukul Sangma of the Congress. “This election is happening in the backdrop of one of the worst mining tragedies,” said Jemino Mawthoh, a former MLA and the United Democratic Party (UDP) candidate for Shillong. “People in Meghalaya have been mining coal for ages but thousands of them suddenly are without a source of livelihood. Something needs to be done but at the same time, we need a mechanism that ensures protection of the environment,” he added. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate for Shillong, Sanbor Shullai, too has sought a “fine balance” between livelihood and ecology. The BJP had in the manifesto for the Assembly poll in February 2018 promised to find a solution to the issue within 180 days. Mr. Pala, who owns 24 sq km of coal mines and has batted for regulated mining, finds the NGT ban unfair to Meghalaya. “The type of mining here is dictated by the terrain.” Chief Minister and NPP president Conrad K. Sangma believes that the ban is not the solution.“I want the ban to be lifted, but the system has to change to ensure safety of miners and protect the environment,” he said. “It is not only about coal,” said green activist Brian Kharpran Daly. “Indiscriminate limestone mining too is killing the land and rivers of Meghalaya...The hills have suffered a lot, and there is no political will to stem the rot, let alone undo the damage,” he added. A case in point is the Meghalaya Environment Protection and Restoration Fund set up, as per the NGT’s direction, with contributions from coal miners, traders and transporters.

You want saboot [evidence] or sapoot [great son]?

The party is slipping out of Pawar’s hand and his nephew is taking over. Pawar was hit-wicket at the hands of his nephew,” he said.

Now, Tej Pratap floats ‘Lalu Rabri Morcha’ in Bihar|Patna|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|In fresh trouble for Lalu Prasad’s RJD, his mercurial elder son Tej Pratap Yadav on Monday urged his mother Rabri Devi to contest from Saran Lok Sabha seat in place of the father of his estranged wife and threatened to contest as an Independent if his request was not heeded. The maverick MLA and former Minister spoke while announcing the formation of a parallel outfit Lalu Rabri Morcha which he insisted was not separate from the RJD and pointed towards photographs of his parents besides younger brother Tejashwi, who has in the recent past emerged as the party’s de facto leader. “Saran is the seat of my father Lalu ji and mother Rabri ji. I urge my mother, with folded hands, that she herself enter the fray from there. If this does not happen I will contest as an Independent and make my best efforts to win it,” a furious Mr. Yadav told reporters here. Chandrika Rai, the party’s MLA from Parsa seat falling under Saran, was announced as the candidate from the Lok Sabha seat last week. BJP has named sitting MP Rajiv Pratap Rudy as its nominee on the seat. Mr. Rai’s daughter Aishwarya had tied the knot with Mr. Yadav in May last year though the latter moved a divorce petition within less than six months of the marriage.

Replying to a query, he shot back, “What action can the party take against me? The RJD leadership has to realise that there is widespread resentment against the NDA government in Bihar which we have to harness. We must not end up angering the people.” ‘Bid to divide us’ “Many elements have entered the RJD who are trying to drive a wedge between my brother and me. I would urge Tejashwi, whom I always call my Arjuna, to beware of such elements,” Mr. Yadav said.

Former vice-chairman of IL&FS arrested|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The spokesperson said that in “granting loans to entities which were not creditworthy or have been declared non-performing assets (NPAs)”, Sankaran had caused wrongful loss to the company and its creditors. Trouble surfaced at IL&FS in the July-September quarter of 2018, when two of its subsidiaries started defaulting on repayment of loans and inter-corporate deposits to lenders. A subsequent series of defaults caused a systemic problem with many non banking finance companies running into financial issues. On October 1, 2018, the Central government took steps to take control of the company through a directive by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and arrest the spread of the contagion to the financial markets.

‘3 more satellites needed’|BENGALURU|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Nobody who has it talks about it and no one else is sure about its actual numbers. But space-based electronic intelligence, the realm that India just forayed into with EMISAT, is said to have been around since the early 1960s, pioneered by the U.S. At least three other space powers are said to be past masters at it — the U.S. as the leader is said to be having fifth-generation ELINT satellites; Russia is not far behind. Then comes China. Around 150 military satellites may be hovering all over Earth right now. According to a few present and former defence scientists, one satellite for ELINT will not suffice and the country may need to have at least three more working in tandem.

India, Pak. scramble jets after UAV sighting|NEW DELHI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|In an indication of the continuing state of high alert, India and Pakistan scrambled fighter jets after a Pakistani Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) was detected close to the border early on Monday. “Around 3 a.m. in the morning, Indian Army reported a Pakistani UAV near Khem Karan sector in Punjab based on which we scrambled two Su-30MKI jets. In response, Pakistan scrambled two F-16s,” a Defence official said. The situation was resolved as both sides backed off. Separately, in an unusual statement, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) of Pakistan armed forces claimed that the air strikes on Indian military installations on February 27 were carried out by JF-17s of Pakistan Air Force and also claimed to have shot down two IAF fighter jets in the aerial engagement that followed. Whether it was F-16 or JF-17 which shot down “two Indian aircrafts is immaterial,” the ISPR statement said, adding they were shot in self-defence. It also said all their fighters, including F-16s, were airborne at that time and “India can assume any type of their choice even F-16.” “Pakistan retains the right to use anything and everything in self-defence,” the statement said.

Won’t be gagged on Kodanad case by government, says Stalin|CHENNAI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|“I will continue to speak about the Kodanad murder case,” said DMK president M.K. Stalin in Kannagi Nagar on Monday. He was speaking at a public meeting to campaign for Thamizhachi Thangapandian, the party’s candidate for the Chennai South Lok Sabha constituency. Stating that the AIADMK went to court to prevent him from linking Mr. Palaniswami’s name to the Kodanad case, he said that it was an unsuccessful attempt. “I will not get frightened if they go to court. I will continue to speak about it,” he said. The DMK leader said that once he comes to power, he will solve the mysterious death of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa and bring to book all those involved in it. “The AIADMK does not want me to speak about her death too. If they want they can approach the courts, but I will continue to do so,” he added. Lashing out at Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami for claiming that law and order was well maintained in the State, he said that the Chief Minister’s name had itself been dragged into a murder case now. He also expressed unhappiness over the manner in which the Pollachi sexual abuse case was being handled. He pointed out that the recent sexual attack and murder of the seven-year-old girl in Coimbatore was an indicator of the poor law and order situation prevailing in the State. Criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said that Mr. Modi had promised to provide two crore jobs every year. “But nothing has happened till date. According to reports, unemployment rate is at an all-time high now,” he added. He said that the Prime Minister had not spared any government department. “This includes the defence forces and an indicator for this is the Rafale scam. He is using the sacrifice of the soldiers for his political gains,” he said. Comparing the Central and State governments as two tumours, he said both had to be removed. “You have to uproot the two governments and give us a huge victory,” he said. Ms. Thangapandian said people from her constituency are free to knock at her door any time to share their problems. “I came to know there is drinking water problem. It was the DMK government that set up the first desalination plant in Nemelli in 2010. Due to this we are getting 300 MLD water. One more desalination plant will be set up,” she said. She added that once Mr. Stalin becomes the Chief Minister, the project to operate MRTS service from Thiruvanmiyur to Mahabalipuram will be taken up.

Paracetamol: toe the line on proper dosage|CHENNAI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|When children have fever, the majority of parents invariably turn to a commonly used medication — paracetamol. While paediatricians consider paracetamol as a safe drug when given in the prescribed dose, any excess in dosage could be detrimental to the child’s health, even to the extent of causing damage to the liver, they add. Recently, doctors at a private hospital received a child with serious damage to the liver. The child had fever and the parent administered paracetamol continuously for three days without checking the temperature. Three days later, the child was in a critical condition due to paracetamol toxicity, but went on to recover with treatment. “Paracetamol is a safe drug when given in the correct dose. Any excess in dosage could cause acute liver cell failure. In such circumstances, children present with drowsiness, vomiting and extreme weakness. But paracetamol overdose may not always be symptomatic. Sometimes, symptoms may emerge two or three days later. So, it is important to make an early diagnosis to save children from acute hepatic failure,” said S. Balasubramanian, medical director of Kanchi Kamakoti CHILDS Trust Hospital. He drew attention to U.K.’s NICE guidelines that say there is no need to treat fever unless it causes discomfort. “Most children may feel uncomfortable when the temperature is 101 or 102 degree Fahrenheit. Then, we need to relieve the discomfort,” he added. Drops and syrups P. Ramkumar, senior consultant paediatrician, Institute of Child Health and Government Hospital for Children, said there is basically confusion between paracetamol drops and syrup. “I frequently remind parents that there is a huge difference between the two. A dosage of paracetamol drops is five times more powerful than say, the same dosage of the syrup, but many are unaware of this,” he said. Abdominal pain, irritability, generalised weakness, loss of appetite, jaundice, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, convulsions and coma are the symptoms of a paracetamol overdose. “Most of the bottles have the dose printed on them and parents should follow the instructions. It should be given once in six hours in the recommended dosage — not more than four times in 24 hours,” Dr. Ramkumar said. T. Sivaraman, consultant, paediatric intensivist, pointed out that he does receive children with inadvertent overdose of paracetamol such as when it is given eight times instead of the prescribed four times. A delay in seeking medical help will lead to liver failure requiring a transplant, he said, adding: “Children come to us with a history, dullness and vomiting. Parents might assume these are caused by the fever. We take their previous history into account and check for signs of toxicity. If we suspect paracetamol toxicity, the treatment is started immediately.”

‘Create an environment of care for autistic children’|CHENNAI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|People with autism are different and must be understood thus.

The take away message of the symposium for parents of autistic children and paediatricians is to identify and accept the child’s condition and seek intervention. According to experts, the condition in a child could be identified quite earlyand be given adequate therapy. Ennapadam S. Krishnamoorthy, founder of Buddhi Clinic, which organised the symposium said, “Celebrate the difference in your children. Create an environment of care suitable for them rather than forcing them to fit in.” Neuroimaging and neurogenetic studies clearly demonstrated that autism spectrum disorders are conditions of brain development, he said and added society should create an “autism multiverse” in which such persons could thrive. Brain simulation The Buddhi Clinic had introduced neuromodulation, and through Rane Holdings CSR support it had launched a transcranial direct current stimulation for adolescents and older adults. Stimulation to the brain had helped in autism-related disabilities such as hand-eye coordination and social skills, he said. On the occasion the Hindi version ofAutism - the Buddhi Bookwas launched.  Autistic children who exhibit poor social skills could have certain competencies, which with training could be developed Usha Ramakrishnan V-P, Indian Council for Child Welfare

Industries submit demands to candidates in the fray|COIMBATORE|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Kovai Power Driven Pumps and Spares Manufacturers’ Association has decided that small and micro pumpset manufacturing units and job working enterprises will support the candidate who gives an assurance to work on the demands of the Association in the Lok Sabha elections. K. Maniraj, president of the Association, said in a press release that the Government had levied three-point GST on pumpsets - 12 % for pumpsets, 18 % and 28 % for components. Under Value Added Tax, it was 5 % for pumpsets and the components. He claimed that nearly two lakh people had lost their livelihood because of 18 % GST on pumpsets and components. Hence, the tax on pumpsets should be reduced to 5 %. The Union Government says several loans have been disbursed under the MUDRA. However, micro units in Coimbatore were unable to get collateral-free loans. The Government should release a white paper on details of credit disbursed under the MUDRA scheme to MSMEs. The Coimbatore SIDCO Industrial Estate Manufacturers’ Welfare Association submitted its memorandum to the candidates contesting in Coimbatore. Its demands were related mainly to GST. The Association sought removal of reverse charge mechanism, reduction of GST for job working engineering units, simplification of GST forms, disbursement of MUDRA loans to MSMEs, inclusion of petroleum and diesel under GST, conduct of MSME facilitation council meeting once a month, and better infrastructure for industries located in the SIDCO industrial estate in Kurichi.

‘Classify transgender persons as minority community’|CHENNAI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Former Supreme Court judge Kurian Joseph on Sunday said that the transgender community should be classified as a minority community and provided all benefits that go with it. He was speaking at a function to launchTranscender, a documentary on India’s first transgender police officer Prithika Yashini at an event organised by the Don Bosco Institute of Communication Arts (DBICA) here. He said it would be wrong to classify them as a backward community (BC) that is based on caste and community. Role of media N. Ram, Chairman, The Hindu Group of Publications, expressed concern over certain provisions in the new Bill for transgender persons. Mr. Ram said the requirement for a medical certification after sex reassignment surgery went against the right of self-identification. He said the Bill did not address issues of the community relating to employment. He underlined the role of the media in making a difference to the lives of the transgender community. Ms. Prithika Yashini said that the 30-minute-long film, directed by Fr. Ernest Pathi, made her understand the difficulties faced by actors. She said she properly utilised the opportunity she received and became a police officer. She urged the public to support any transpersons in their families or friends circle. Scholarships presented Her parents, Kalaiarasan and Sumathi, were also present on the occasion. Vice-president DBO, Fr. Don Bosco and DBO’s economer Fr. Xavier Packiam were present.

TNUSRB files bogus expert opinion; High Court livid|CHENNAI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Madras High Court on Monday was shocked to know that Tamil Nadu Uniformed Services Recruitment Board (TNUSRB) officials had submitted a bogus expert opinion by a non-existing Indian Institute of Technology-Madras professor to win a case filed against it by a police constable. Justice S. M. Subramaniam took serious note of the issue and directed the Member Secretary, TNUSRB to file a detailed affidavit in the court by Wednesday explaining the circumstances under which such a bogus document had been submitted in the court just to obtain favourable orders. Written exam The issue relates to a writ petition filed by Grade II constable S. Arunachalam, who had applied for the post of Sub Inspector of Police (Finger Print) and sat for the written examination. He filed a writ petition early this year alleging that he was not awarded marks though he had given the right answer to a particular question. Since TNUSRB claimed that his answer was wrong, the judge insisted on an expert opinion. An opinion provided by one D. Murthi, Professor, Department of Mathematics, IIT-Madras, on March 1, was submitted in the court and the writ petition was dismissed on March 13 based on such “expert” opinion. However, on learning that there was no such professor by name Murthi in the Mathematics Department of IIT-Madras, which was ascertained through an application under the Right to Information Act of 2005, the petitioner’s counsel V.M. Venkatramana urged the court to reopen his client’s case and render justice. When the judge called for an explanation from TNUSRB, he was told that it had identified some impersonation on the issue of providing expert opinion to the recruitment board and that a criminal case had been booked in this regard against two persons, G.V. Kumar and D. Moorthy, who furnished the false document. Wondering how those two individuals were connected with TNUSRB and why their services were engaged to obtain an expert opinion, the judge directed the Member Secretary of the board to file a detailed affidavit on the issue.

Fishermen seek separation of traffic along eastern coast|CHENNAI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|To ensure the safety of fishing boats, various fishermen’s associations in the State are demanding a Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) for merchant ships for the eastern coast as well. A similar TSS covering the western coast of the country from Maharashtra till some distance beyond Kanniyakumari in Tamil Nadu, has been proposed by the Central government. Indian Fishermen Association’s M.D. Dayalan said that such a TSS would definitely help fishermen. “Even last month, a fishing boat that was anchored off a port in Andhra Pradesh was sunk after being hit by a merchant ship. Luckily, nobody was hurt since those aboard were awake,” he said. Nanjil Ravi of Akila Indhiya Meenavar Sangam said: “The TSS must however not take up too much of the fishing grounds and such a corridor must be fixed after due consultation with the fishers here.” A former official of the Fisheries Department said that other countries had their own shipping corridors where fishermen do not fish. “The United Nations Convention for the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) provides provisions for innocent passage of ships in times of need or distress. The Director General of Shipping has rights to ensure safe passage of ships with the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ),” he said. ‘Not practical’ Senior advocate V.J. Mathew, who is also the chairman of the Kerala Maritime Board, however, said that having such a corridor was not practical and that it contradicted the UNCLOS, which is also referred to as the Law of the Sea Convention.

Perambur feels the absence of representatives|CHENNAI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Perambur, a constituency surrounded by waterways and railway lines, has been waiting for its share of infrastructure improvement for several years now. The absence of elected representatives to speak for it, both at the Legislative Assembly and the Greater Chennai Corporation Council, has had an adverse impact on the constituency where development has taken a back seat, residents complain. Comprising Kodungaiyur, Vyasarpadi, Erukkenchery, MKB Nagar and parts of Perambur, the constituency is predominantly home to the working class. Shifting of the Kodungaiyur dump yard and scientific methods of waste management for better use of prime space remain the major and common demand of the residents across the constituency, putting pressure on the winning candidate. Residents of MKB Nagar and Krishnamurthy Nagar, Kodungaiyur noted that they have been fighting for shifting the Kodungaiyur dump yard for several decades now. The only solace was that the burning of garbage has reduced recently. V.P. Dayalan, vice president, MKB Nagar Development Owners’ Welfare Association, said “We protested in the past against the pollution and health hazards caused in the neighbouring areas, including Ezhil Nagar and Bharathi Nagar. The stench is too powerful and groundwater has been contaminated.” For an area surrounded by major and minor canals, several parts of the constituency are severely affected by drinking water crisis and water contamination. R. Venugopal, a resident of MKB Nagar, said the old sewer network needed to be replaced to arrest sewage overflow. Captain Cotton Canal that runs around the region remains neglected. Plea for more buses “Several MTC bus routes have been abruptly stopped. We need more buses to T. Nagar and Mambalam and a small bus through Mannady,” he added. The Vyasarpadi flyover has not served the purpose much as the traffic piles up near Basin Bridge. “We need a bridge linking Central Avenue, MKB Nagar to Korukkupet to reduce the distance, said N.S.Ramachandra Rao, president, Ever Vigilant Citizens Welfare Association. Residents also complained that many tall promises made during the last election remain unfulfilled. Voters in Satyamurthy Nagar demanded that the tenements to be built by Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board must be restricted to three-storeyed buildings. N.Thangaraj of Satyamurthy Nagar said the area lacks government schools that provide quality education, or playgrounds. Though candidates of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and Communist Party of India (Marxist) have won the Assembly elections in the past, P.Vetrivel, who contested as part of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) symbol, emerged winner in the past election. However, he became one of the 18 dissident MLAs and is now in the fray as an independent candidate fielded by Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK). The ruling AIADMK and the opposition DMK are heading for a face-off in Perambur as candidates of both the parties are contesting for the first time. Though debutants, both hope that their work through their party positions would help them to win votes. DMK candidate R.D. Shekar’s campaign is targeted at women as they outnumber the men voters in the constituency. “Shifting out Kodungaiyur dump yard is already in the election manifesto. Residents seek a solution to drinking water shortage and better sewer network,” he said. AIADMK candidate R.S. Raajesh, alleging that the disqualified MLA did not bring any change in the locality, said “I have tried to address several people’s issues. Kodungaiyur dump yard now gets only biodegradable waste and there is a proposal for a biomethanation plant.” U. Priyadarshini of Makkal Needhi Maiam and S. Merlin Suganthi of Naam Tamilar Katchi are among the 40 fielded in the constituency.

Parents accuse school of violating norms|Coimbatore|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Parents of students of Amrita Vidyalayam, Nallampalayam, on Monday petitioned the district administration alleging that the school violated norms by collecting fee in excess of what is prescribed. The parents, who submitted the petition on Monday, alleged that though they had paid the tuition fee, the school refused to take the money meant for books and notebooks insisting that it would take the money only if they paid for shoes, socks, sports dress, school and lunch bags. In the past 15 years, the school had not demanded money for the aforementioned items. Last year, it forced them to buy the items saying that they had purchased those items from the market and would take their consent before doing so for the next year. Their efforts to reach out to the school authorities did not materialise as the latter was not ready to meet them, the parents said. The school forcing the parents to buy books and notebooks for Rs. 5,000 was unacceptable as the very items in the open market cost only Rs. 1,500. The Rs. 5,000 for books and note books along with a similar amount for shoes, socks, sports dress and the two bags pushed the annual cost of education by Rs. 10,000, which was a huge burden on parents. It was all the more taxing for parents if more than one child was a student of the school. The parents further said that though a member of the Tamil Nadu Commission for Protection of Child Rights had written to the district administration and Chief Education Officer, Coimbatore, in this regard, the school continued to flout the norms. And, when they contacted the regional office of the Central Board of Secondary Education, Chennai, the officials there had clearly told them that they, the parents, were under no compulsion to buy books, note books or the other aforementioned items from the school. But the school continued to violate the rules. In response to the parents’ petition, the Commission had said that the person it deputed to verify the allegations against the school found them to be true and asked the district administration to look into the following issues – the school collecting Rs. 50,000 as donation without issuing receipt, engaging private vehicles to ferry students and those vehicles having no safety features, having no student admitted under the Right to Education Act and the school collecting fee in excess of what is prescribed.The Hindu‘s efforts to reach out to the school management by calls and messages did not elicit a response.

There are over 40 hamlets in the hills of which many are located in remote areas. Water is supplied by the Guthiyalathur panchayat by drawing water from bore wells and distributed to the people. However, due to drop in water level in the bore wells, supplying water to the people were hit. Kannamma (45) of Jeeva Nagar said that water is supplied once in eight to 10 days for less than 30 minutes and they could fetch only three to five pots of water. “As summer gets intense, water availability is turning worse”, she added. People said that water availability in bore wells had dropped significantly in the past two months as the hill failed to receive adequate rainfall. Hence, the motors have to be operated for longer hours to fill the tanks and supply the water, said P. Kaliappan, a farmer. He said that the situation would be very difficult for the next three months as people have to go in search of water everyday that will affect their livelihood.

Palaniswami had formed an alliance with a party that opposed the memorial and for Jayalalithaa and the unveiling of her portrait in the Assembly. “They also said that she was a convict and would have been behind the bars if she were alive.

Youth collective hits the campaign trail to support Dravidian politics|CHENNAI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Young students and working professionals have come together to campaign for the DMK and Thamizhachi Thangapandian, the party’s candidate for the Chennai South Lok Sabha constituency. Beginning their trail in Mylapore, Stalin Jacob, a volunteer, said all of them were united in their support for Dravidian politics, which was best represented by the DMK at present. “Over the last few years, we feel that our individual rights and freedom have been encroached upon. Lending our support to the DMK, we have decided to canvass for Ms. Thangapandian by meeting the residents through a door-to-door campaign,” he said. Objecting to Tamil Nadu students being subjected to the National Eligibility-cum- Entrance Test and the growing imposition of Hindi, Mr. Stalin said over 50 volunteers had come together to voice their opposition to the current governments at the Centre and the State. Before they began the campaign, the group also launched the candidate’s official campaign website,www.ithamizhachi.comThis, they said, was a decision taken by Ms. Thangapandian as she felt it was important to focus on the youth, who were catalysts of change. “I know several youngsters who are cynical about politics and I’ve thought so myself too.

Stating that he belonged to a generation that had enjoyed the benefits offered by the DMK government, Vijay Mohan, an IT professional from Perungudi, said that the party’s ideology resonated with his.

We are not waiting for alliance: AAP|NEW DELHI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|With speculation of an alliance between the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Congress refusing to die down, AAP moved its campaign for the Lok Sabha election in Delhi up a gear on Monday, holding nine public meetings in a day. Having announced candidates for all seven Lok Sabha seats of Delhi last month, AAP has been campaigning across the city for weeks now. But, AAP leaders as well as some in the Congress have kept the possibility of an alliance open. Responding to a question about recent reports of the Congress offering a 4-3 seat-sharing arrangement in Delhi, AAP Delhi convener Gopal Rai said, “Which formula? The one that is running on TV? TV channels are reporting that the Congress has offered 3-3-1 or 4-3 in Delhi, three seats in Haryana and zero seats in Punjab. If they are giving zero seats, how is that an offer? There is no point in joking.” ‘Cong said no to tie-up’ Mr. Rai said the Congress had already “said no” to an alliance, referring to a meeting of Opposition leaders at Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar’s residence in February, where, according to AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal, Congress president Rahul Gandhi had declined the offer. He said the Congress had neither publicly nor privately said it would be ready for alliance, despite remarks from some leaders of the party in support of the idea. “We are holding nine public meetings today to campaign for seven MPs. We are not waiting. We are fully committed to our campaign in support of full statehood for Delhi,” he said, referring to the AAP’s central theme for the Lok Sabha campaign in Delhi. He added that it appeared the Congress was in a state of “maha confusion” and was weakening the Opposition parties in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Kerala, by contesting and splitting the anti-BJP votes, and eventually “strengthening the BJP”.  TV channels are reporting that the Congress has offered 3-3-1 or 4-3 in Delhi, three seats in Haryana and zero seats in Punjab. If they are giving zero seats, how is that an offer? There is no point in joking   Gopal Rai AAP Delhi convener

Parent initiatives in the city reach out to young adults with autism|CHENNAI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|While there have been concerted efforts to increase awareness about autism spectrum disorder and inclusiveness in schools over the years, many parents are now turning the focus on the challenges faced by young adults with autism. Groups of parents in the city have come together to seek solutions and make options accessible for young adults with autism on what they can pursue or dabble in after the age of 18. “The biggest question many parents face is what young adults with autism will go on to do after they finish school. They may not be necessarily ready for work and other children generally are off to college at this stage. There is a huge gap here with very few options available for them,” explained Kavita Krishnamoorthy. A year ago, she, along with a group of parents of young adults and children on the autism spectrum, came together to form the CanBridge Academy, which they say approximates a ‘college’ for young adults with autism. “At present, we concentrate on building work and life skills with a focus on weaving, cooking and arts and have four students,” she added. Ranjana Munje, a parent from the city, said that her son who loves painting and art has now found a space where he can be meaningfully engaged at CanBridge academy. More options Parent initiatives like this have ensured that they not only bridge the gap but make fun and interesting avenues such as the arts available. “While we have heard of mainstream educational institutions in other cities where initiatives like this are encouraged to co-exist, it is yet to take shape here in Chennai,” she added. Radha Nandhakumar, a special education consultant from the city said that while opportunities for vocational training for children with special needs were available, the responsibility to find them a job or place them in a company usually went back to the parents. “To address this, a few of us — parents of children and young adults with autism and other special needs — decided to offer training and set up a small scale unit,” she said. Speaking about the Gurukulam integrated centre, Ms. Radha said that this not only enables them to give the young adults an inclusive space to train and work, but that it would be based on their abilities and needs. Experts say many parents solely focus on computers and related training as the only options available. “It however is important that children or young adults with autism are introduced to skills that they actually show interest in,” she added.  The biggest question many parents face is what young adults with autism will go on to do after they finish school Kavita Krishnamoorthy

HC asks State not to finalise PG medical, dental counselling results|Madurai|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Monday directed the Directorate of Medical Education not to finalise results of the ongoing counselling for medical and dental PG degree/diploma courses held under the Tamil Nadu State quota. The four-day counselling forcandidates who qualified through NEET began on April 1. Justice R. Mahadevan, allowing the counselling to continue, directed that results shall not be finalised for a period of two weeks and adjourned the hearing till then. The court was hearing the writ petition filed by P. Jeyakumar of Madurai, who sought a direction to restrain the Directorate of Medical Education from going ahead with PG counselling. The petitioner, an Assistant Surgeon, challenged the government order issued by the Health and Family Welfare department in March 2019 awarding 10% of NEET marks secured by Medical Officers working under the Tamil Nadu Public Health Services as incentive for securing a PG seat. The grievance of the petitioner was that the GO categorised ‘difficulty of areas of work’ for the purpose of granting incentives. Candidates working at difficult areas in hills were eligible for 10% of marks secured in NEET per year of service. Similarly, it was nine per cent marks for working in difficult areas in plains, eight per cent for remote areas and five per cent for rural areas. Dr. Jeyakumar, currently employed at the Government Rajaji Hospital in Madurai, said that this would adversely affect the chances of medical officers working in municipal and corporation areas, which are excluded from the purview of granting incentive marks. He sought to restrain the Directorate of Medical Education from going ahead with the counselling.

Deserted, but not deterred from voting|ERODE|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|While candidates and leaders of political parties are criss-crossing the State to garner votes for the Lok Sabha election, a tribal settlement nestled in a dense forest on Kadambur hills in the district has not once witnessed such campaign visits all these years. And yet, the locals continue to exercise their democratic right to vote whenever polls are held. With 137 houses and 421 electors (224 men, 197 women), Malliamman Durgham falls under the Bhavani Sagar Assembly segment and The Nilgiris parliamentary constituency. Located about 9 km away from a motorable road, the hamlet could be reached only by jeep, after passing through the dense forest. “We have been living here for many generations, cultivating millets, guava and jackfruit. No candidate from any political party has visited our hamlet seeking votes in any election,” said 70-year-old Kaliappan. “Though no development work has been carried out, we continue to vote,” he added. Since the habitation is situated inside the Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve (STR), roads could not be laid, and even now, pregnant women and patients are carried on cradles or cots on a two-hour journey to reach the hospital. “Only five months ago, automatic solar lighting systems were installed, which help power three bulbs in each house. But we cannot even charge our mobile phones. All electronic gadgets remain idle in our houses,” said M.K. Subramani, 38, the first graduate from the hamlet. He said only a few party functionaries would visit the hamlets, seeking votes. As many as 24 children are studying at the Panchayat Union Middle School in the hamlet, which serves as a polling station. After Class VIII, few pursue further studies at other schools, while most become labourers, said C. Palanisamy, 37, who runs a studio at Kadambur. No road “Since there are no roads, I visit my house only once or twice a week,” he added. Rajeswari, 27, who had completed Plus-Two, said most youngsters take up sugarcane cutting while entire families turn bonded labourers in agricultural fields in the plains. “We are cut off from the outside world and the person who visits Kadambur has to gather news and inform us of happenings,” she added. Though people are aware that tar-topped roads cannot be laid in their hamlet, they want at least a motorable road to be able to reach Kadambur. “It is difficult to digest that many generations of our community have passed without any development. Only a motorable road will revive our lives,” said Mr. Kaliappan.  Though no development work has been carried out, we continue to vote KaliappanA resident

PIL plea wants decentralisation of Anna University|MADURAI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Monday ordered notice to the Higher Education department and Anna University on a public interest litigation petition that sought a direction to decentralise the university for the benefit of students attached to its six regional campuses. A Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and S. S. Sundar ordered notice and adjourned the hearing. The petitioner, V. Jagatheesan of Dindigul, said that in 2007 the State took a decision to split Anna University into six constituent universities with two in Chennai and one each in Tiruchi, Coimbatore, Tirunelveli and Madurai, in a bid to make the administration effective. The regional universities were highly convenient for parents, faculty members and students as their grievances could be addressed at the regional level itself, he said. However, in 2011, the government decided to merge the six universities. This move affected the students, particularly at the time of publication of results. It was not possible for a centralised unit to concentrate on all colleges. Some of the grievances faced by students were delay in publication of semester results, sanction of scholarships and existence of only one centralised placement cell, he said. The State ought to consider the Yash Pal Committee report that clearly mentioned that the Indian university system had a large number of colleges affiliated to it, making it difficult to manage and maintain quality, he added.

‘I have focused on water-related issues over the last five years’|CHENNAI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The youngest MP to be elected in the 2014 Lok Sabha Elections from the Chennai South constituency, J. Jayavardhan is once again contesting from this urban unit. Excerpts from an interview with the candidate from the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK). In the last five years, what were your main areas of focus in the constituency? I have focused on several issues pertaining to the availability of water and had ensured that funds were granted for the setting up of the desalination plant in Nemmeli, which is at the stage of issuing tenders. With a futuristic approach, I have also called for setting up a similar plant with a 450 mld capacity in Perur and a project report is being prepared for the same. For the Pallikaranai marshland, I am not just looking at preservation but also solid waste management, water management and conservation activities. What would be your areas of focus for the next five years, should you be re-elected? During my term, I have looked at healthcare in areas such as Perungudi, Sholinganallur and Injambakkam, among many other places, and safety, water management, transport, infrastructure to help manage traffic and have ensured that funds have been procured from the Centre for various projects. I have requested the voters in the constituency to vote for me so that I can continue the work at the same pace and ensure that we complete projects effectively. I expect projects such as the desalination plant to be completed in two years if voted to power. Despite procurement of funds, what about the criticism that several roadblocks delay the timely implementation of projects? Even if issues crop up, as a Parliamentarian, I have constantly been in touch with the State government and seen what can be done. As the head of the District development coordination and monitoring committee (Disha) in Chennai, we are constantly working to ensure that we will speed up the process and ensure time-bound completion of projects. You are the son of D. Jayakumar, Fisheries Minister and senior AIADMK member. Many feel you inherited this position you occupy now.Comments? I was chosen to contest the elections in 2013 with the blessings of our leader (former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa). In the last five years, I have been appreciated by the party cadre and leaders for the work that I have done and this has been taken cognisance of. I am thankful for the opportunity to contest again.  In the last five years, I have been appreciated by the party cadre and leaders for the work that I have done

Touching upon festering issues, Natarajan reaches out to voters|Coimbatore|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|It is 8 a.m. Monday and at the Edayarpalayam Junction on Thadagam Road, dozens of workers of parties in the DMK-led Social Progressive Alliance are busy chatting and sharing election news from across the State. A few metres off the road, in the portico of a house sits the Alliance’s candidate for Coimbatore Parliamentary constituency – Communist Party of India (Marxist)’s P.R. Natarajan. In a few minutes, Mr. Natarajan along with other leaders - Payya Gounder of the DMK, K. Mahesh Kumar of the Congress and a few others - boards the campaign vehicle, a medium-sized goods carrier modified to accommodate half-a-dozen people. The party district secretary V. Ramamoorthy, who also accompanies Mr. Natarajan, urges cadre to stick to the route decided upon to help Mr. Natarajan cover as much localities as possible. After a few leaders speak, Mr. Natarajan picks up the mike to highlight what he considers an important aspect of the DMK’s manifesto - “If I win and if the Alliance gets the mandate to govern the country, I'll work to waive off education loans. This will benefit crores of parents who have availed themselves of the loan to educate their children.” He then says, “the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government promised to deposit Rs. 15 lakh to each citizen. It was a false promise. The Congress’ promise to give Rs. 72,000 a year to people below poverty line is not a bogus promise like that of the NDA’s.” Moving to localities that have a good number of small and medium industries, Mr. Natarajan raises the problems caused by the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax, and that seems to resonate well among the unit owners and labourers. S. Shankar, who works at an industry that manufacturers a spare part used in automobiles, says the GST has hit the small units hard. A change is required, and will vote for it, he says. Mr. Natarajan says BJP now offers to help the SMEs only because of the pressure mounted by the Left parties. At Anna Nagar, he tells the voters that their vote has the power to remove two governments. “Your vote for the Secular Progressive Alliance will remove both the NDA government at the Centre and the AIADMK government in the State. Therefore, use the opportunity you get on April 18 to dislodge the two.” At Kovilmedu and Cheran Nagar, it is the Coimbatore Corporation awarding water distribution contract to private firm Suez that the CPI(M) candidate chooses to highlight. Mr. Ramamoorthy says Mr. Natarajan is striking a chord with the people with the issues he highlights. “I see that whenever the candidate speaks about the GST.”

High Court Bench directs recovery of compensation|MADURAI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has directed the Joint Commissioner of Labour (Workmen’s compensation) to recover the compensation amount awarded by the Labour Commissioner Tribunal of Dindigul to a daily wager, who lost both his legs after coming in contact with a live wire during work hours. Justice Abdul Quddhose said under Section 31 of the Employees Compensation Act, 1923, the Commissioner of Labour was empowered to recover the compensation awarded to a workmen as he was deemed to be public officer within the meaning of Section 5 of the Revenue Recovery Act, 1890. Accordingly, the Commissioner should recover the amount within four months, the court said. The court said that the award of compensation had attained finality as no appeal was preferred against the order. Though representation was made to the Collector for recovering the amount, it was the Commissioner of Labour alone who was empowered to recover the compensation. The Labour Commissioner Tribunal had awarded Rs. 4.72 lakh with an interest of 12% per annum to the daily wager. The petitioner, S. Pandi of Dindigul, sought a direction to recover the compensation amount from his employer. He lost both his legs after he came in contact with a live wire at a construction site, where he was engaged as a daily wager.

Police to seek custody of accused in Thudiyalur case|COIMBATORE|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The All Women Police Station (AWPS), Thudiyalur, will seek the custody of Santhosh Kumar (32) of Thondamuthur, who was arrested on charges of sexually assaulting and murdering a seven-year-old girl at Kasthurinaickenpudur in Coimbatore. Officials privy to the investigation said that a petition seeking the custody of Kumar would most likely be submitted before the court on Tuesday. The police have submitted before the court material objects recovered from the house of Kumar's grandmother in the victim's neighbourhood where she was sexually assaulted and murdered on March 25. Kumar, an interior decorator, had been staying with his aged grandmother to take care of her. The material objects include some of the clothes used by the accused - which may have body fluids of the accused or the minor girl - a handkerchief that the accused used to strangulate her and a t-shirt of the accused, which he used to wrap her body after murder. “The T-shirt has a blood stain. Presence of body fluids of the accused like semen or that of the victim like saliva or blood in the T-shirt will have to be confirmed through forensic examination,” said an official. The accused had dumped the body of the victim in the neighbourhood in the early hours of March 26.  Meanwhile, the police said that Kumar's grandmother had died of age-related ailments and the accused was not at home when her condition deteriorated on March 25. “After the sexual assault and murder, the accused hid the body of the girl inside the house and went out to a petty shop close to a nearby temple where he smoked. He was informed by others that his grandmother's condition was deteriorating. He rushed to the house and the elderly woman died a few minutes later,” the official said.

It’s a tough junction to negotiate|MADURAI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The railway overbridge at Periyar bus stand junction is one of the widely used, if not the most, bridges in the city and witnesses heavy traffic throughout the day. The bridge that connects Periyar bus stand junction on one side branches into three arms on the other side, connecting Ellis Nagar, T. B. Road, and the western entry of Madurai railway junction. While the fork junction in the middle of the bridge witnesses congestion at times since it is unregulated, it is not accident prone since vehicles end up slowing down at the spot. However, motorists opine that the second fork on the bridge, which branches towards Mahaboopalayam (T. B. Road) and the western entry of railway junction, remains prone to accidents. The main difficulty at this junction appears to be for those vehicles that go from the bridge towards the western entry of railway junction. With no space to wait for the oncoming traffic and with vehicles coming at high speed from both the directions, the motorists face a tough time navigating this small junction. “Those coming from Mahaboopalayam side are ascending the bridge and therefore they do not slow down. Similarly, those coming from the other side are descending the bridge and hence they come at a high speed,” says R. Tirunavukkarasu, an auto rickshaw driver from Ellis Nagar. Pointing out that the junction is located at a point where the bridge takes a curve, N. Murugesan, another auto rickshaw driver said that vehicles coming in both the directions often try to cross the median line to negotiate the curve. “This makes it even more difficult for vehicles wanting to take a turn since there is no space to wait and other vehicles are coming dangerously close,” he said. He added that it was particularly difficult for the two-wheelers since heavy vehicles do not slow down for them. Traffic island A traffic personnel on duty at Periyar bus stand acknowledged the need for a small traffic island at the junction so that vehicles, mainly two-wheelers, can wait for traffic before taking the diversion. “We have created one with the help of few barricades for the vehicles coming from the western gate of railway junction to go towards Mahaboopalayam or Periyar bus stand. The same should be done for vehicles coming from Periyar side as well,” he said.  There is a need for a small traffic island at the junction so that vehicles can wait for traffic before taking the diversion Traffic personnel

Scientists release shrimp seeds|Ramanathapuram|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Continuing the sea-ranching programme to replenish and enhance the shrimp stock and support the livelihood of the local fishing community, the Mandapam regional centre of Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) has released seeds of green shrimp species, locally known as ‘thaalai iral’ in the Palk Bay. As ‘overfishing’ of brooders (parent shrimps) and juveniles had resulted in a drastic depletion of shrimp resources in the Palk Bay and Gulf of Mannar regions, CMFRI launched the sea-ranching programme and had been releasing shrimp seeds in the last five years. On Friday, a team of scientists, led by R. Jayakumar, senior scientist, CMFRI Mandapam regional centre, released 8 lakh lakh seeds of ‘green tiger shrimp’ in the Palk Bay at Thonithurai near Mandapam. A.K. Abdul Nazar, Principal Scientist, Madras Research Centre of ICAR-CMFRI, J.L. Ajith Stalin, Assistant Director of Fisheries, Mandapam, and fishermen leaders were among others, present at the event. The programme was coordinated by CMFRI scientists M. Sankar and B.Johnson. The shrimp seeds were released in the seagrass bed regions with the help of local fishermen, officials said. The seeds would be ready for harvest in about five to six months and the sea ranching was synchronised with the fishing ban period, which would come into force in April. Mr. Jayakumar said that during 2017-18 CMFRI had released total of 1.7 million shrimp seeds in the Gulf of Mannar and Palk Bay regions and this year 2018-19 the scientists released 3.3 million seeds, exceeding the target fixed for the year.

Official, three policemen suspended for bribery|CHENNAI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Election Commission of India has placed an official of the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC), a Sub Inspector and two constables under suspension for allegedly demanding a bribe of Rs. 25,000 from an individual while carrying out poll surveillance near the Integral Coach Factory (ICF) last week. According to an officer, L. Babu, an Assistant Engineer with GCC, Sub Inspector Vasudevan and constables Veeramani and Karthikeyan were placed under suspension. The duration of suspension could be less in other cases, but since this case was monitored by the Election Commission, it could be more. Even the subsistence allowance would not be paid immediately, the officer said. During election-related surveillance on March 27, a flying squad team checked Jai Guhan of Avadi, who had Rs. 49,700 with him, and questioned him. Even though Mr. Guhan pointed out that he did not have to produce any documents as the Election Commission had permitted people to carry cash up to Rs. 50,000, the team allegedly demanded Rs. 25,000.The Hinduhad reported the incident on Saturday. Mr. Guhan was taken to the Villivakkam police station, where the officials allegedly asked him to pay up. Later, he lodged a complaint with the ‘1950’ helpline manned by the Commission. Following this, an inquiry was initiated, and it found that the team that had demanded the bribe deleted the video evidence to cover up the incident. A senior officer said: “Any complaint regarding the elections could be made either by calling the ‘1950’ helpline managed by the Election Commission or through the cVIGIL mobile application developed by the Commission.”  Since this case was monitored by the Election Commission, the duration of suspension could be higher

I-T searches only to threaten opposition parties, says Stalin|VELLORE|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|DMK president M. K. Stalin on Monday charged that the Income Tax department conducted searches at on premises of DMK treasurer Durai Murugan and his associates primarily to intimidate the opposition parties in an election year. Addressing an election meeting in Sholingur in Vellore, he asked if the Election Commission would conduct searches at the residence of AIADMK leader and Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami if there was a complaint. “There has not been any issue during the past five years and since it was election time, the officials have conducted a raid on the residence of Mr. Durai Murugan and also in the college run by his son,” Mr. Stalin alleged. Refusing to accept the contention of the Chief Electoral Officer to reporters that the searches were conducted following a police complaint, Mr. Stalin asked, “If I give a complaint that there is money to the tune of several crore rupees stashed in Edappadi [K. Palaniswami]’s house, will you [Election Commission and I-T Department] go and conduct a raid?” Or would similar action be taken against Ministers, relatives and their benamis, he asked, adding that the DMK would not be intimidated by such action. ‘Faced greater threats’ The DMK cadre were raised by DMK founder C.N. Annadurai and late DMK president M. Karunanidhi and had faced greater threats posed by the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA), Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA) and Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA), he claimed.

BJP attempting to destroy secular fabric of country: Vaiko|TIRUCHI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|MDMK general secretary Vaiko on Monday charged the Narendra Modi-led BJP government and the Hindutva forces with meticulously planning to destroy the secular fabric of the country. “The Central government was trying to impose one culture, one language, one religion and Sanskrit across the country,” he said. Campaigning at Kollidam Tollgate on the city’s outskirts in support of Perambalur Parliamentary constituency IJK candidate T.R. Paarivendhar contesting on the DMK symbol, Mr. Vaiko said the need of the hour today was to protect democracy. Attacking the Centre further, he said it had betrayed the interests of Tamil Nadu by giving its nod for construction of Mekedatu dam across the Cauvery in Karnataka, which would adversely affect several agrarian districts in Tamil Nadu and the farming community and force them to sell their farm holdings. Alleging that the BJP government had waived huge amounts of loans obtained by corporate companies besides offering them huge tax relief, he said the Centre, on the other hand, was refusing to waive loans obtained by the farming community and educational loans disbursed to students. Unemployment problem was plaguing the country and the future of younger generation was at stake, he said and accused the ruling AIADMK government of failing to question the Centre on the issues. The Edappadi K. Palaniswami government in the State was mired in corruption and was afraid of the Centre and obeying its diktats. Stating that time had come to throw out the AIADMK government, Mr. Vaiko said the people of the State could do this in the upcoming elections and ensure that the rights and interests of Tamil Nadu were well protected.

In-plant training for engineering students a distant possibility|TIRUCHI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Downslide in industrial activities in the region has meant that fulfilling the requirement of in-plant training for engineering students specified by All India Council for Technical Education has become a tall order for most of the colleges in the region which are struggling with drastic decline in student admissions. According to AICTE, internship programme not only helps fresh pass-outs in gaining professional know-how but also benefits corporates by way of gaining fresh perspectives on business issues and even discovering future business leaders. It is not that the colleges are not keen on transforming students into talented and innovative workforce in a competitive scenario. The fact is that the possibility for in-plant training does not exist at all due to the sickness of several industries that were earlier the ancillaries of BHEL, according to a management functionary of a private engineering college in Tiruchi. Students who used to go for internships during the vacation after their second and third years are unable to find any openings for internship. Students in government engineering colleges are in a relatively advantageous position, T. Senthil Kumar, Professor and Dean, University College of Engineering, Bharathidasan Institute of Technology Campus, Anna University, Tiruchi, said. In the absence of in-plant training, students passing out of the technical institutions lack the skills required by the industry, a principal admitted. The model curriculum prepared by AICTE with the help of prominent academicians to produce competent employable graduates as per the needs of the industries includes the internship for students of six months’ duration at different stages of the programme. The purpose was to expose technical students to the industrial environment, which cannot be simulated in the classroom; and provide them opportunities to learn, understand and sharpen the real time technical/managerial skills required at the job.  The colleges are required to have a dedicated training and placement cell to guide students to choose the right career and to plan for programmes and activities to enhance knowledge, skill, attitude and aptitude. According to academics, private college managements are unable to do much and are reconciled to the reality of the continuance of industrial sickness in the region.

Intra-party feud triggers clash|Tirunelveli|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Intra-party feud in AIADMK and DMK led to clashes on Sunday night, resulting in injuries to three persons and damage to a few vehicles here . Consequently, the police raided the houses of the youth involved in the clash on Monday to search for lethal weapons and country bombs. When a party workers’ meeting was organised by AIADMK here recently to review poll preparations and finalise the campaign schedule, youth from Kottaiyadi and Paraiyadi in Tirunelveli Town participated in large numbers. While the youth from Kottaiyadi were given party positions and ‘empowered’ to look after the election work in their area, the decision earned the wrath of those from Paraiyadi, who entered into a heated argument with their rivals on Sunday around 11 p.m. As the argument led to a clash between the youth of Kottaiyadi and Paraiyadi, D. Gowtham, 20, S. Shankar, 22, and his younger brother Satish Kumar, 19, were hacked with sickles. With grievous cut injuries, they were rushed to the Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital where their condition is said to be “stable.” Agitated over this, a group of Paraiyadi youth went to Kottaiyadi with arms, where they smashed three cars, two auto rickshaws and six bikes, all parked outside houses as residents, on seeing the angry mob, remained inside. Even before the police could rush to the spot, the armed gang managed to escape. After registering a case against 40 persons in connection with the attack on the trio and subsequent violence, the police have picked up 10 persons . Meanwhile, a police team, led by Assistant Commissioner of Police, Tirunelveli, Satish Kumar, and Inspector of Police, Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad, Paulraj, raided the houses in Kottaiyadi and Paraiyadi around 11 a.m. on Monday. Metal detectors and sniffer dogs Pluto and Bharani were also used. “Four machetes were seized during the drive. Though we suspected that country bombs could have been hidden in some of these houses, no improvised explosive was seized,” said a police officer. In another clash, Subramanian of Palayamkottai, supporter of DMK Tirunelveli city district secretary Abdul Wahab, was allegedly attacked with an iron rod by four persons, allegedly due to intra-party feud . He has also been admitted to the TVMCH. “A complaint has been filed against Windsor, a DMK functionary and three of his associates,” a police officer said.

DMK front is a coalition of contradictions: Vasan|THANJAVUR|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Tamil Maanila Congress leader G.K. Vasan has termed the DMK-led alliance in Tamil Nadu as a coalition of contradictions. Hitting the campaign trail after offering prayers at Anugraha Anjaneyar temple, Keezhavasal, on Monday, Mr.Vasan pointed out that in Karnataka the Congress supported the Janata Dal (Secular) government, which had taken a tough stand on the issue of sharing of Cauvery water with Tamil Nadu. By this time, Tamil Nadu should have received its due share of water, but the Congress and JD(S) blocked it. At the same time, the DMK in its pursuit of power and position openly extended its support to the nefarious act of the Congress by forging an alliance with that party in Tamil Nadu. Similarly, Communists who opposed the candidature of Congress president Rahul Gandhi in a Parliamentary constituency in Kerala, were sharing the election platform with the Congress in Tamil Nadu. Stating that there was a lot more contentious issues among them that could be listed out, Mr.Vasan said they should realise that the people of the State could no longer be deceived. Development could be achieved only if the governments at the Centre and the State were on the same page. It was during the previous AIADMK rule that the seeds of development in Thanjavur were sowed. Now, the fruits of such development works were being reaped by the people. Thus, giving the mandate in favour of the AIADMK-led alliance in the State would help bring in more development. Assuring voters that schemes detrimental to agriculture operations in the State would not be allowed by the AIADMK combine, he said it was a well-known fact that the AIADMK and TMC raised their voice against any attempt to disrupt the peaceful existence of minorities in society. Mr.Vasan solicited votes in favour of the TMC nominee for Thanjavur Parliamentary constituency N.R. Natarajan in the ‘autorickshaw’ symbol and in favour of the AIADMK nominee for the by-elections to the Thanjavur Assembly Segment, R. Gandhi in ‘two leaves’ symbol. Campaigning along with TMC leader, AIADMK Thanjavur (South) district secretary and Rajya Sabha MP R.Vaithilingam called upon the electorate to keep in mind the slogan of late TMC founder G.K. Moopanar “Valimaiyana Bharatham, Valamaana Thamizhagam” before pressing the button on polling day.

Maiya Mandapam to be reconstructed in one year|MADURAI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Work at the 800-year-old Maiya Mandapam on the Vaigai near the Alber Victor bridge will be completed in a year, say senior officials from the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments department. Joint Commissioner N. Natarajan says that damaged portions of the mandapam will be reconstructed after dismantling. The mandapam, an integral part of the city’s infrastructural identity, has a significant portion in dilapidated state as it has remained ignored for years. Of the 36 original pillars, only 22 remain as the rest have suffered damaged over time. The older retaining walls that once protected the structure too have worn out with age. A senior engineer associated with the Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple, who is part of a team executing the restoration work at the mandapam, says that it does not have uniform architecture. “It seems like materials from different parts of the country were used in the original construction. The mandapam also bears signs of renovation with age,” he says. He says that retaining walls around the structure are being constructed in the western portion with concrete. They have also dug around three metres into the river bed to strengthen the base. “Walls, which are already disturbed, will collapse otherwise,” he says. He also points out that the roof requires diligent reconstruction because it has suffered immense damage due to weather-related issues. Another engineer says that it is essential to dismantle and rebuild the damaged portions. Otherwise, the structure will collapse. “Though there have been some objections towards altering portions of the structure, without dismantling some pillars from the top we will not be able to strengthen the base,” he says. Alien elements like plastic will not be used, he assures.

With Chithirai round the corner, Pudu Mandapam is on a roll|MADURAI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|As March gives way to April, traders at Pudu Mandapam say that they are ready to face a bevy of customers looking for costumes ahead of the Chithirai festival. Devotees who customarily dress in ‘costumes’ of different gods and goddesses purchase their wares from shops lining this hall. Last year, when the mandapam was shut following a fire in the eastern wing of the Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple, caused major loss to the shopkeepers. These shopkeepers say that carrying out their trade again has been a rejuvenating experience even though their days may be numbered. Madurai Corporation has proposed to move the traders to the nearby Kunnathur Chatram to ensure that the Pudu Mandapam is saved. G. Muthupandi, president of the Pudu Mandapam Traders and Tailors’ Association, refers to the hall as a ‘festival factory.’ “For generations, the mandapam has been the epicentre of trade-related activities in Madurai. Every tailor here works a month in advance to ensure that the costumes are available before the day of Chithirai Festival’s flag hoisting ceremony,” he says, pointing to a variety of colourful costumes. There are sequinned caps in red, pants with patchwork and belts with jingling bells, says I. Sheik Dawood, a tailor, whose family has been selling these paraphernalia for three generations now. The costumes are usually made with velvet and satin material and splashed with sequins, pom-poms and rexine patches. Tailors often paste picture of Lord Karuppasamy on the hats to show fervent devotion of the devotees. The 154 tailoring shops sell costumes ranging between Rs. 400 to Rs. 500 for children and Rs. 700 to Rs. 1,000 for adults. They are customised to the customer’s measurements as well. Mr. Muthupandi says that the pants are made in such a way that they provide ease for the devotees to dance. “The devotees prance around the streets when Lord Kallazhagar leaves his abode Sundararaja Perumal Temple and makes his way to the city. The clothes are made in such a way to avoid wear and tear,” he says. Apart from the costumes, Mr. Dawood says that they also sell fakearuvals(billhook),padhai kattis(shoes with nails) andkondai perambus(knotted sticks) as part of the costume.Sattai(whips), used during worship, are also sold here. “We do not make too much of a margin selling these clothes but we get a tonne of satisfaction. No one cares about religion or caste when they purchase at Pudu Mandapam. After all, I, a Muslim, fold my hands and pray to Goddess Meenakshi when I hand over the costume to each customer as part of the tradition,” says Mr. Dawood.

NIT-Tiruchi kick-starts programme under GIAN|TIRUCHI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|National Institute of Technology, Tiruchi, has launched a five-day programme under the Global Initiative of Academic Networks (GIAN) in Higher Education, aimed at tapping the talent pool of scientists and entrepreneurs. The programme focusses on the adverse effects, use and disposal of microbicidal agents and pharmaceuticals on human and ecological health. Titled, ‘Chemical/Phytochemical mediated disruption of bacterial Acyl Homoserine lactone mediated, quorum sensing communication systems,’ it seeks to encourage scientists and entrepreneurs' engagement with institutes of Higher Education in India so as to elevate India's scientific and technological capacity, augment the country's existing academic resources, accelerate the pace of quality reform and elevate India's scientific and technological capacity to global excellence for faculty and students to learn teaching skills and seek knowledge and experience from International faculty, said a press release from the Department of Chemical Engineering, NIT-Tiruchi. The objective, according to the organisers, is to expose participants to threats involved in the use of microbicidal agents, understand quorum sensing and quenching, developing effective carriers including nanostructures as delivery agents and to get laboratory-based hands-on training in this technological area. Speaking at the event, Diby Paul, Professor, Truett McConnell University, said pathogenic organisms were becoming better at infecting their host in warmer conditions, a concern for global warming. Climate change had led to change in precipitation pattern, sea level rise, ocean acidification and super storms, and that the course would help to find a solution for removal of microbial contamination in surface waters and wastewater to serve a polluting free society. G.Arthanareeswaran of NIT-Tiruchi, demonstrated quorum sensing compound incorporation in membranes for anti-biofouling.

Salem city braces for water crisis|Salem|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|With temperature soaring by each day, the Salem City Municipal Corporation has made elaborate arrangements to deal with water crisis during the summer season in the region. For Salem, Mettur Dam is the major water source and given the present water level at the dam, the Corporation officials are hopeful that they would be able to overcome this summer without major water scarcity issues. As on Monday, the water level at the Mettur Dam has touched 62.95 ft and 8,000 cusecs of water was being released from the dam for distribution purposes. The inflow to the dam has reduced to 35 cusecs. A senior Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board official said that necessary preventive measures have been taken to meet water needs during the summer. “Over the past three months we have identified most of the illegal connections from the main line in Mettur and they have been disconnected. We have also increased the pumping by two hours”, said the official. Corporation Commissioner R. Sadheesh said that the civic body has taken precautionary measures to meet water needs. “We started taking precautionary measures two months ago and the current water levels at the dam is sufficient to meet water requirements during the summer season. While only 90 to 95 mld was required, we have been able draw up to 121 mld of water from the dam to meet water distribution within Corporation limits. We have also arranged six water tankers besides four Corporation tankers and three other alternate water resources as back up to meet water needs.”

Kallakurichi residents scramble for water|KALLAKURICHI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Kallakurichi residents are digging deep and coughing up more money to source water to meet their daily needs as the town and suburban areas face a severe water crisis. The crisis in this newly-carved out district, which began eight years ago, had now reached its zenith due to lack of rain last monsoon thereby forcing residents to dig deep borewells and buy portable water for drinking, cooking and other requirements. “My borewell will go dry within 15 minutes of operating. Water thus pumped from the borewell will not be enough for cooking and washing utensils. So we buy water in cans daily for drinking purpose and depend on tankers for other requirements. Every alternate days we spend around Rs. 200 on water,” Vasanthi, a resident of Kavarai Street in Kallakurichi, toldThe Hindu. The alternate day water supply by the Kallakurichi Municipality was not sufficient to meet the daily requirements, she added. Velammal, who runs a small eatery near the Sub Collector office, said she buys a pot of water for Rs. 3 a day. “It is adding to our daily expenditure and causing a dent in profit,” she said. Sinking water table The dip in piped water supply is forcing more people to dig borewells but not with much success. John Paul, a teacher and resident of Vilanthangal Street, said it was hard to source water even after digging wells up to a depth of 800 feet. He said many people in his street bought packaged water for Rs. 25 to Rs. 35 a can. Karthick kumar, a resident of Kavarai Street and who runs water can business, said the shortage of water had become acute this year. He said some six or seven years ago water could be sourced by drilling borewells up to a depth of 300 to 500 feet. “Now, even after digging deep we are not able to get water,” he said. At least 0.5% of people were dependent on private operators for supply of water either in cans or tankers. A tanker load of 5,000 litres costs anywhere between Rs. 1,200 to Rs. 1,500, Mr. Kumar said. Inquiries with Kallakurichi municipal authorities revealed that many farmers had turned into water suppliers. They drew water from their open wells on their fields and sell the water to houses and commercial establishments. A study was conducted by the Anna University to identify possible areas to draw groundwater. Water could be drawn from 5 out of 25 bore wells drilled by the municipality, an official said. The depleting water table coupled with gradual reduction in daily supply for Kallakurichi by Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board from its Rishivandiyam-Manalurpettai Combined Drinking Water Supply Scheme was the main cause for the present crisis, said a municipal employee. As per the scheme of things, the Kallakurichi region was supposed to receive 29.25 lakh litres of water a day to meet household and commercial requirements. The daily supply from the scheme had reduced to 5 to 6 lakh litres a day. And if there was a technical snag in pumping or power outage, supply to the region would be completely disrupted. People suggested that removing silt from the Gomuki dam would improve storage of water during rainy reasons. It would partially solve the water crisis.

Will create jobs for one in every family, says Tamilisai|THOOTHUKUDI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|BJP State president Tamilisai Soundararajan on Monday said that she would create jobs or make entrepreneurs in every family. Addressing reporters, Ms. Tamilisai said while she was promising various projects like an IT park, trade centre and bullet train, DMK candidate M. K. Kanimozhi was claiming that these were not feasible. “BJP will make the projects possible,” she said. Responding to queries about whether promises on such big ticket projects were approved by the party top brass, Ms. Tamilisai said that she believed they would be considered positively. “I believe that Prime Minister Modi will respond positively to development projects for backward areas. That is why I am promising them,” she said.  Local potential Further, she said that there was possibility to create small businesses across the district based on local potential. “Based on natural resources available, we can create jobs for one person in a family,” she said. This would be made possible by the existing air, water and rail connectivity in the district. The BJP candidate said that Ms. Kanimozhi had to gain from dynasty politics. “When she first became a Rajya Sabha member, it was not because she had worked for the party for long. It is because of dynasty politics,” she said. Referring to the recent I-T raids at the house of DMK treasurer Durai Murugan, she pointed out that the DMK had been out of power for the last eight years in the State and five years in the Centre. The visit of Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and BJP national president Amit Shah, who would share the stage in Thoothukudi on Tuesday to garner votes for Ms. Tamilisai, would be received well by the people, she claimed.

Post-inspection, two electrified sections get operational nod|TIRUCHI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Commissioner of Railway Safety, Southern Circle, Bengaluru, has accorded statutory clearance for operation of passenger and freight trains in the newly electrified Tiruchi-Thanjavur and Villupuram-Cuddalore Port Junction broad gauge sections. A communication from the Commissioner of Railway Safety authorising the two electrified sections for operation of rail traffic has been sent to Southern Railway headquarters as well as to organisations which executed the electrification project. The authorisation has been given subject to a series of stipulations spelt out by the Commissioner of Railway Safety to be adhered by the railway administration. Accompanied by top officials of Southern Railway, the Commissioner of Railway Safety inspected the electrified stretch from Villupuram to Cuddalore Port on March 22 and the energised section from Tiruchi to Thanjavur on March 23 travelling on a special train and carrying out speed trial hauled by electric locomotive in both stretches. While the electrification project in the Villupuram-Cuddalore Port section was carried out by Rail Vikas Nigam Limited, a Government of India Enterprise under the Ministry of Railways, the stretch from Tiruchi to Thanjavur was energised by Central Organisation for Railway Electrification. The Commissioner of Railway Safety has made it clear that the authorisation given by him for both electrified stretches was valid only after a certificate was issued by the Principal Chief Electrical Engineer regarding completion of electrification of loop lines and other pending essential safety works such as bonding and earthing. The certificate of completion would have to be submitted to the Commission. One of the key stipulations put forth by the Commissioner of Railway Safety is that all crew and guards be adequately trained to work in electrified sections and all safety equipment, sectioning diagram, distinct power block caps, OHE isolator key boxes be provided at all stations falling under the two sections. Another key direction is that the railway administration should display general caution notices of metal frames regarding danger of high voltage traction wires at station entrances and at prominent places at each station particularly on stanchions or pillars supporting platform roof to alert general public. Observance of all temporary and permanent speed restrictions in force, or as may be imposed from time to time on account of track, bridges, overhead electricial equipment, rolling stock and signalling and adequate publicity regarding regular running of trains on the electric traction to be given for information to passengers, road users at level crossing gates as well as to railway staff working in both sections are among the slew of other stipulations issued. The Commissioner of Railway Safety has also clearly stated that since the electrified sections are newly commissioned, a public notification should be issued regarding dangers of roof travelling. Prior to introduction of regular passenger services in the newly authorised electrified sections, freight services should be run for a period of one week so that the operation and working of the new installations were stabilised, it further said. RVNL is executing the electrification project in the main line section from Villupuram to Thanjavur via Cuddalore Port, Chidambaram, Mayiladuthurai and Kumbakonam. The first stretch from Villupuram to Cuddalore has now been completed and works are underway in the remaining stretches. Similarly, electrification project is underway in the Tiruchi-Thanjavur- Tiruvarur- Karaikal section executed by Central Organisation for Railway Electrification. The first portion from Tiruchi to Thanjavur has been energised.  Safety directions  All crew and guards must be adequately trained to work in electrified sections  All safety equipment must be provided at all railway stations  Caution notices on danger of high voltage traction wires must be prominently displayed  Temporary and permanent speed restrictions must be observed

Volunteer group takes up maintenance of city parks|MADURAI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Though summer vacation has already commenced for most schoolchildren in Madurai, the scorching heat that is already soaring over 100 degree Fahrenheit deters them from venturing out of their homes to play. “On one hand, we want our children to go out and play instead of watching television or playing with mobile phones. However, with the scorching summer and lack of parks in Madurai, how can we expect them to play outdoors,” asked M.C. Saravanan, one of the coordinators of the Madurai-based volunteers’ collective Vaa Nanba. To do its bit to tackle this problem, the group has commenced carrying out maintenance and repair works on Sundays in parks that have been left unused due to lack of maintenance. While it carried out maintenance work at a park in Anna Nagar last week, this Sunday a park in Valluvar Colony in P and T Nagar was renovated. “Both these parks were in unusable condition with growth of shrubs,” Mr. Saravanan said. He said that the work at Anna Nagar required more than a week of preparation since the swings, see-saws, and other playground equipment were rusted and broken. The volunteer group pooled in money to repair all the equipment and carried out the clean up work last Sunday. “When we visited the park this week, we could see children playing there,” he said. Though the park in Valluvar Colony was in a similar condition, the playground equipment was at least in good shape, he said. “We only had to paint and oil them,” he said. The maintenance of these parks, which were constructed by Madurai Corporation, was the responsibility of the residents welfare associations in the locality. According to Vaa Nanba, a key concern expressed by the residents was that if the parks were maintained properly, anti-social elements used them at nights for drinking and other such activities. “They feel that frequent patrolling by the police can avoid such incidents,” Mr. Saravanan said.

Where finding water is a daily struggle|VELLORE|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Each day has become a nightmare for residents like Vijayalakshmi of Chinnathammalseruvu, a small village on the outskirts of Gudiyatham constituency. She along with her neighbours wait for a private tanker to supply water; each pot costing Rs. 4. In fact, many parts of the constituency, including semi-urban areas, are reeling under acute water scarcity. The groundwater has depleted or turned salty due to pollution by tanneries. The Combined Water Supply Scheme with Cauvery river as source covers only a few parts of the constituency but even that has become irregular, residents say. The constituency goes to the bypolls on April 18 and the water crisis could be one of the key deciding factors. “The bitter reality is that we do not have water even for our basic needs at home. We are depending on private tankers,” said Vivekanandan, a resident of Pernambut. The wells in Madanapalli river that used to supply water for various areas have dried up. “As of now, the Cauvery water scheme is the only source. But, the supply is only 50% of what was earmarked for Pernambut and surrounding villages” said T. Basheeruddin, president of Consumers’ Welfare Protection Society of Pernambut. “We are facing severe water crisis, and we are getting water only once in 15 to 20 days. This minimal supply lasts only for two days. Areas including Tharaikaadu, Kamaraj Nagar, Thiru vi ka Nagar and Othavadai are worst-hit,” he laments. “Gudiyatham town gets its supply from the mainline. Interior areas suffer the most. No one has concentrated on water schemes but have only brushed aside our representations,” he rues. There is no water for agriculture as well. At least 65% of borewells have failed. The delay in constructing a dam across Malataaru in Bathalapalli has caused enough damage to farming, says K. Loganathan, district president, Thamizhaga Vivaisaigal Sangam - Vellore West. “Construction of a dam at Bathalapalli is the only way to solve water crisis in this part of the district,” says D. Krishnan, a farmer. “The project was abandoned several years ago, and only an earthen bund remains now. We are facing drought. If this dam is constructed, groundwater in areas including Bathalapalli, Masigam, Madanapalli, Erukampattu and Pernambut will recharge, benefiting several acres of cultivable land,” he notes. Weavers in trouble Gudiyatham constituency has a sizeable number of families involved in weaving lungies for livelihood. But their wages remain the same for four years. “Several years ago, there were at least 15,000 families involved in handloom weaving here. Today, there are only 3,000 families. A weaver gets Rs. 150 a day. The GST has indirectly impacted the livelihood of weavers as the owners are refusing to hike the wages citing the burden cast by the GST on the trade,” says N. Jothi Basu, secretary, Handloom Weavers Association (CITU), Vellore. Congestion remains another unaddressed issue. The town is congested as the arterial road continues to be narrow for the past 50 years. But the vehicle population has grown manifold, residents say. “The Gudiyatham municipality has increased the taxes including water charges. We pay taxes but there are no basic amenities,” Rathnam, a resident complains. In the 2016 Assembly elections, AIADMK’s C. Jayanthi Padmanabhan defeated DMK’s K. Rajamarthandan by 11,470 votes. But she was disqualified along with 17 other MLAs of the T.T.V. Dhinakaran camp. Many residents are unhappy for having been left without a MLA for a long time now. For candidates fielded for the bypoll, addressing the water needs of residents top the list of assurances. S. Kathavarayan of DMK and Ms. Padmanabhan, who will once again face elections on an AMMK ticket this time, have assured construction of the dam at Bathalapalli. Mr. Kathavarayan has assured extension of the Cauvery water scheme to more areas and also create a ring road as the town is heavily congested. Ms. Padmanabhan has assured to create a new road alignment for Kailasagiri Hills, a new bridge at Nariyampattu, SIPCOT for providing employment and a women’s college at Pernambut. AIADMK’s R. Moorthi said he will take steps to establish a weaver’s park, expand the government hospital at Gudiyatham and construct a new bridge across Koundinya river. Makkal Needhi Maiam’s candidate S. Venkatesan has assured to sink borewells in villages and construct check dams.  The GST has indirectly impacted the livelihood of weavers as the owners are refusing to hike the wages citing the burden cast by the GST on the trade

Towards a 100% turnout|TIRUCHI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Students of Seeethalakshmi Ramaswami College on Monday joined Systematic Voters’ Education and Electoral Participation (SVEEP) initiatives taken up by election officials in the city and organised a slew of events at their campus. The students took up the activities in association with Integrated Child Development Scheme to drive home the twin messages on the importance of achieving cent per cent voting and ethical voting. Carrying balloons with awareness messages, the students made a human formation to indicate 100%. Besides, a painting exhibition was also organised. The students also sought to explain the importance of voting and ethical voting through the traditional game of Snake and Ladder. Collector S. Sivarasu, who inaugurated the events in the presence of R. Padmavathy, Principal, and K. Pechiammal, District Planning Officer, ICDS, also affixed his thumb impression on a bill board and so did the students, committing themselves to ethical voting. Mr. Sivarasu also administered a pledge to the students. A mock polling booth was also set up to demonstrate the voting process to first-time voters among students.

Our votes not for sale, say Valliyoor gypsy families|TIRUNELVELI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The gypsy families of Poonga Nagar on the outskirts of Valliyoor in Tirunelveli district have taken a proud decision of “not selling their votes for cash” during the Lok Sabha poll. The slow but steady transformation of these gypsy families is something significant as they have started to send their children to school following the initiatives taken by a private organisation and a small group of reporters from Valliyoor. When they were given free house sites and then free concrete houses on these plots a few years ago, then Collector M. Karunakaran told them to admit their children in school.Though the gypsy children were admitted in a residential school meant for child labourers at nearby Kottaiyadi, most of them, especially the girl children, became dropouts. When these girl children got married at the age of 15 or 16 years, the officials intervened again. Thanks to these efforts, two children, Madhavi and Parvathi, have now written their Secondary SSLC public examination. On coming to know about the gypsy girls’ feat, Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish, before the commencement of the public examination, visited the girls at their homes in the gypsy colony in the first week of March to greet them with mementos. Before leaving the gypsy colony after spending more than an hour, Ms. Shilpa appealed to them to cast their votes in the Lok Sahba poll without fail and not to get influenced by any allurement.  Clear decision Now, the gypsy families, as a mark of respect to the Collector’s appeal, have made their decision clear and erected a digital flex banner, sponsored by the journalists, at their colony having 182 votes. “Poverty and consequent hunger may force some of us to beg at times… but we won’t sell our votes for cash as it is our right,” proudly says the banner, which carries photos of the gypsy families.

Life term for three brothers in Virudhunagar|Virudhunagar|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|  Three brothers were on Monday sentenced to undergo life imprisonment for murdering their uncle Marudhan at Tamil Padi under Tiruchuli police station limits in 2009.

‘Maintain separate account for expenses’|VILLUPURAM|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|District Election Officer and Collector L. Subramanian on Sunday said that contesting candidates in the Lok Sabha elections to Villupuram (Reserved) constituency must maintain a separate bank account for meeting election expenditure. Speaking at a meeting here, Mr. Subramanian said that Rs. 70 lakh has been fixed by the Election Commission for each candidate.

Two independents stage protest near offices of Returning Officers|Virudhunagar|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Two Independent candidates, N. Vallinayagam, for Virudhunagar Lok Sabha constituency, and Rajendran for Sattur Assembly constituency by-election, staged protests near the offices of the respective Returning Officers complaining that there was no level-playing field for independents in the election. Mr. Vallinayagam said that both the candidates were from Makkal Satta Iyakkam. “Even the Suvidha App introduced by the Election Commission for the benefit of candidates to get permission for their electioneering through single window system is not made functional for me. I reside in Rajapalayam and I cannot go to different offices to get permission for my daily campaign. Though the EC has given a technology, it is not made functional as the officials failed to work on it here,” he charged. Besides, he complained that till date the Election officials had not given him the identity card meant for the candidates. Mr. Vallinayagam said that there was no level-playing among the candidates. The allotment of symbols and positioning of the candidates on the ballot papers were in favour of the political parties, he said. Rajendran was taken to the police station after he sat on a protest outside the office of Revenue Divisional Officer, Sattur.

Advocate expresses concern over safety of road users|Virudhunagar|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Even as the basic structure of the road overbridge on Ramamoorthy Road has been completed and vehicular movement has started on the bridge, an advocate, Masilamani, has raised concerns over the safety of road users complaining about elevation of the bridge on Western side of Madurai-Tirunelveli broadgauge railway line. Mr. Masilamani complained that the length of the bridge on Western Side had been reduced by 20 metres and one pier that was found a mention on the proposed alignment was missing. Citing replies got from the Superintending Engineer and Divisional Engineer of NABARD and Rural Roads on his queries raised through Right To Information (RTI) Act, the officials had contradicting statements on the length of the bridge on the Western side. “The Divisional Engineer said that it was reduced to 264.545 metres in the approved design as against the 284.064 metres originally planned in the proposed plan,” Mr. Masilamani said. The advocate also said that the ground that was dug up for erecting the 10th pier was closed without constructing the 10th pier. Thus the number of piers was reduced to nine and the length of the bridge was reduced to 264.545 metres. He wondered how the estimate cost of the bridge that was Rs. 20.53 crore for the proposed alignment for higher length remained the same for the approved design that has been reduced by 20 metres. “By reducing the length of the bridge, its elevation has increased — that is — the slope of bridge has become steeper and would pose danger to vehicles with lesser pulling power. The vehicles could not climb up the bridge and also face the danger of coming in the reverse direction and hit other vehicles,” he charged. Based on the direction of Chief Engineer, Highways, Chennai, Divisional Engineer (Paramakudi) NABARD and Rural Roads inspected the bridge and verified the measurement of the structure on March 27. An official said that the project had been executed as per the design approved by the Design Wing and it is technically safe for road users. However, he added that the road had not been officially thrown open for traffic, even as vehicles were plying on it. The officials said that works like laying service roads and installing street lights were still pending. The advocate said that the DE has told him that the findings of inspection report would be soon be sent to him.

DMK’s court cases affected Jayalalithaa’s health, says Chief Minister|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, campaigning in the area on Monday, added a new twist to Jayalalithaa death case. He blamed the DMK for the death of the former Chief Minister, saying her health was drastically affected only after the “unnecessary torments” she was subjected to by the DMK by dragging her to Supreme Court, after being “exonerated of charges” in the High Court. DMK president M.K. Stalin, out of “fear and frustration” over not being able to cobble a formidable alliance, was alleging that the AIADMK was in collusion with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The AIADMK-led combine was a “mega-alliance,” which was above considerations of religion and caste, Mr. Palaniswami said. He said his party had entered into an alliance with the BJP in the interests of the country, and that the ideals of the two parties were different. Addressing a campaign meeting at Thuvakudi in Tiruchi in support of DMDK candidate V. Elangovan, the Chief Minister said the AIADMK had demonstrated its support to minorities by vehemently opposing the passage of the Triple Talaq Bill in Parliament. The AIADMK had also increased the subsidy for Christians undertaking pilgrimage to Jerusalem. He termed the DMK-led combine as an opportunistic formation and cited MDMK leader Vaiko’s decision to contest on the DMK symbol as an instance of “rank opportunism”. Mr. Palaniswami said he sympathised with senior leaders of DMK, saying they were being sidelined due to dynastic politics of Mr. Stalin's family. The Chief Minister claimed that Mr. Stalin's son Udayanidhi’s ascent in the DMK was not to the liking of the senior leaders in their party. Mr. Palaniswami attributed the State's highest performance of 46.8% gross enrolment ratio in higher education, and the rapid progression of Tamil Nadu as a power surplus State to the vision of late Jayalalithaa. The Global Investors Meet 2019 would result in industrial investment of over Rs. 30,400 crore and creation of five lakh direct jobs and an equal number of indirect jobs for the educated workforce, he c;laimed. Tamil Nadu was the only State to receive awards for best performance in the areas of agricultural production, education, transport, and power, Mr. Palaniswami added. The Chief Minister canvassed for votes for the DMDK candidate at Gandhi Market, Vayalur Road, Somarasanpettai and Srirangam in Tiruchi district, before continuing his campaign in Pudukottai district later in the day.

Bank recruitment scam: CBI files chargesheet against 446 persons|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has filed chargesheet against 446 persons, including the former chairman and managing director of Indian Overseas Bank (IOB), union leaders, other staff and recruits, who were allegedly involved in criminal conspiracy, cheating, forgery and corruption. The chargesheet was filed on behalf of the CBI by its special public prosecutor M.V. Dinakar before S. Jawahar, special judge for the CBI. The judge, after taking the chargesheet on file, issued summons to the accused for their appearance before the court on April 3. The CBI alleged that the Personnel and Administrative officials of IOB, Central Office, in collusion with the office-bearers of the All India Overseas Bank Employees Union (AIOBEU) recruited ineligible candidates as messengers/sweepers in more than the approved number of vacancies. According to the chargesheet, the president of the union, L. Balasubramanian, and general secretary S. Srinivasan, along with the other accused, including the then chairman and managing director (CMD) M. Narendra, hatched a criminal conspiracy in appointing sweepers and messengers in various centres across the State from 2013 to 2015. Investigations revealed that Mr. Narendra accorded approval on a note, which led the union leaders to recruit ineligible candidates. Though the education qualification for the post was a pass in Standard VIII or a fail in the SSLC examination, many of the recruits were over qualified and some of them had worked in foreign countries. They had produced fake certificates claiming that they had failed in Standard X. All the accused were charged under section 120B (Criminal Conspiracy), 420(Cheating), 468(Forgery), 471(Using as genuine a forged document which is known to be forged) of IPC and provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act.

Huge cash haul from premises of Durai Murugan’s ‘associate’|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Mr. Durai Murugan’s son Kathir Anand is contesting from the Vellore Parliamentary constituency in the general elections. During the day, searches were also conducted at educational institutions and premises managed by Mr. Anand. At the time of going to print, the searches that began in the morning were still on at some of the locations in Vellore. Currency counting machines were also requisitioned from local banks. While usually the I-T department maintains absolute secrecy of search operations, on Monday video clips and photos of cash bundles being examined were circulated all day on mobile messaging platforms, though the source of the same remained uncertain. Chief Electoral Officer Satyabrata Sahoo told journalists in Chennai that only on the basis of the I-T department’s report would they be able to conclude if the cash belonged to any candidate or party. While DMK president M.K. Stalin charged that the I-T searches were conducted at the behest of the BJP-led Central government to intimidate the Opposition, Mr. Durai Murugan alleged that there was a conspiracy to rescind the poll notification in Vellore Lok Sabha constituency and two Assembly constituencies in the region where bypolls are due. “They have miscalculated that by targeting they can intimidate the others in the DMK. Today it is me, tomorrow it will be someone else. But this is being done by those who can’t read the people’s mind,” he said. Mr. Durai Murugan further alleged that his son had effectively been prevented from campaigning for the last three days by the ongoing searches. I-T officials had on Saturday searched Mr. Durai Murugan’s house and an engineering college in Christianpet near Katpadi managed by Mr. Anand and recovered Rs. 10.50 lakh “excess” cash and some documents. Searches were conducted on Monday at six places including at another DMK functionary Asther Ali’s house in Kalpudhur and a school managed by Mr. Anand. Though searches in these two premises were completed by evening, the outcome was not immediately known. In another case reported from Coimbatore, the I-T department seized Rs. 9.83 crore in cash. “The assessee is a young man by the name G. Ramesh, the proprietor of Universal Trading Solutions, who was collecting deposits from the public promising high returns. He trades in the commodities market,” the EC said. In Tamil Nadu, Rs. 108.75 crore in cash and precious metals valued at Rs. 93 crore had been seized so far, it added.

Forest dept. to conduct detailed assessment of factors causing fires|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Following an unprecedented phase of forest fires that gutted large tracts of forest lands in the Nilgiris Forest Division this year, the Forest Department has planned to assess the factors that caused the fires. D. Guruswamy, District Forest Officer, Nilgiris division, said that the department was now spreading awareness among the public on the measures they needed to adopt to prevent forest fires. Man-made fire While lack of rainfall has been one of the main factors for the increase in the number of fires, improper disposal of flammable items, and starting fires on purpose to clear land for grazing have also accentuated the crisis. “Most of the fires that broke out this year have been man-made, either accidental or by miscreants. Our first priority is to reach out to the communities living close to forest areas, and to get them stop starting fires,” said Mr. Guruswamy. However, the department plans to be more prepared next year by assessing the primary causes for the fires this year. “Many of the fires have been centered around old eucalyptus, wattle and pine plantations, declared as forests, where there is a build up of biomass,” said Mr. Guruswamy. Officials said that one of the reasons leading to a build-up of biomass in these forests was decrease in the number of people who collected eucalyptus leaves from these forests to produce oil. As a temporary measure to paper over the cracks caused by a lack of frontline staff who can be employed to fight fires, the department is also hiring people from tribal communities to help put out fires.

‘Congress has cadre in every T.N. village ’|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Secretary of All India Congress Committee, Sanjay Dutt, who is in charge of the party’s Tamil Nadu affairs, has criss-crossed the State multiple times. A three-time Member of the Maharastra Legislative Council, Mr. Dutt is so familiar with the topography of Tamil Nadu that he could list out his tour plan for the next 10 days with the names of towns and districts without a pause. In this interview, he traces the strength of the party in Tamil Nadu and how Congress had nurtured its cadre base in the State where it has not ruled for the last half a century.  What is your assessment of Congress base in Tamil Nadu? Congress party has a good cadre base in every block, village and booth. This is a unique phenomenon as it is very difficult to sustain such a cadre base despite not being in power for 50 years. That is the loyalty and commitment the cadre have for the party. How has this been possible for such a long period? Though it has been a marginal strength after the days of Indira Gandhi, leaders like Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi have nurtured it by giving special focus to Tamil Nadu with additional representations to the State in the Union Cabinet. More representations were given to Tamil Nadu despite a small number of MPs from the State when compared to other States. What is the mood of the people of the State now? Going by the social media trending of ‘Go Back Modi’ when he made frequent visits in the last few days, it is very clear that the mood of the people is anti-Modi. This is because the BJP has ignored Tamil Nadu. Even during Çyclone Ochi, he reached out to the affected people very late whereas Rahul Gandhi interacted with affected fishermen and farmers. The PM did not bother to console the victims of Cyclone Gaja even as he was having meetings with industrialists and attending marriage function of an actor. What about the mega alliance of the BJP and AIADMK? The BJP has been blackmailing, threatening the AIADMK government so far. AIADMK has gone with the BJP to protect the skeletons in its cupboard. The so-called coalition is an unholy alliance, given that late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa had said the party would never ally with the BJP. The alliance is a marriage of convenience as against the DMK-led Secular Progressive Alliance that is based on ideology. What does this Lok Sabha election mean to the Congress? Congress cadre know that democracy is at cross roads in the country. This election is crucial because, if the dictatorship of Mr. Modi is allowed then there is a possibility that there would not be any election in future. The present government is dictating the people on even what they should eat and every institution is being destroyed.  AIADMK has gone with the BJP to protect the skeletons in its cupboard

Soon, Metro timing display at airport|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Chennai airport’s domestic and international terminals will soon display Metro timings to encourage air passengers to take the transit system. The Metro station located inside the premises of the airport is one of the most popular in the city and about 6,500 people travel through it on a daily basis. Officials of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) said they recently held discussions with Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) and agreed that displaying Metro timings will get more people to use public transport. “Specific areas in both domestic and international arrival halls will have the displays. As soon as air passengers step out of the aircraft, they will be able to spot the timings displayed on real-time basis. We want them to know there is such an option, as many of them may not know it. It will be good if many people take the public transport,” an official said. Signage to be put up CMRL will provide the display screens and the other necessary facilities for putting them up inside the terminals. Besides, signage will be put up in various locations of the terminals directing passengers to the Metro station as well. Both the terminals are connected to the station by a walkalator and a tube. “The AAI has already begun the work to install the signage and this work should be complete by the end of this month,” another official said.  CMRL had carried out a study of the domestic and international flight timings, after which it was decided to extend the timings of the early morning and late night services. At present, the first service starts as early as 4.30 a.m. and the last one at 11 p.m.  As soon as air passengers step out of the aircraft, they will be able to spot the timings displayed on real-time basis AAI official

Election officials should ensure provision of good drinking water in sufficient quantity in all polling booths. There should be separate queue for senior citizens and women carrying children as in foreign countries. It will be difficult for senior citizens and women with babies to wait in a long general queue at booths. Pandal or shamiana should be provided at places where voters stand in queues in open space.

Hence, there is resistance not only from the local people but from many residents of this beautiful district who do not want to change the ‘character’ of the place. Hence the authorities are requested to reconsider this huge project. G. Stanley Jeyasingh, Nagercoil.

Huge cash haul from the premises of Durai Murugan’s ‘associate’|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Chief Electoral Officer Satyabrata Sahoo told journalists in Chennai that only on the basis of the department’s report would they be able to conclude if the cash belonged to any candidate or a party. While DMK president M.K. Stalin alleged that the searches were conducted at the behest of the BJP-led government at the Centre to intimidate its rivals, Mr. Durai Murugan alleged that there was a conspiracy to rescind the poll notification in Vellore Lok Sabha constituency and two Assembly constituencies in the region where by-polls are due. ‘Miscalculation’ “They have miscalculated that by targeting, they could intimidate the DMK. Today it is me, tomorrow it will be someone else. But this is being done by those who can’t read the people’s mind,” he said. Mr. Durai Murugan alleged that his son had been effectively prevented from campaigning for the last three days because of the ongoing searches. Monday’s searches came against the backdrop of last week’s visit of an Election Commission’s static surveillance team and IT officials to Mr. Durai Murugan’s house. The team first went to his house on Friday night but returned without conducting any search as it did not have a warrant. The I-T Department officials suspect that some of the cash seized on Monday could have been moved from certain premises linked to Mr. Durai Murugan on Friday night. I-T officials had on Saturday searched his house and an engineering college in Christianpet near Katpadi managed by Mr. Kathir Anand and recovered Rs. 10.50 lakh “excess” cash and some documents.  At six places Searches were conducted at six places, including at another DMK functionary Asther Ali’s house in Kalpudhur and a school managed by Mr. Kathir Anand. Though the searches were completed by evening, the outcome was not immediately known.

To create awareness among voters, especially first-time voters, to cast their votes without fail and to ensure cent percent voting, the Returning Officers are conducting mass awareness programmes.

Voters should make it a point to exercise their franchise without fail, according to their conscience and judgement.  S. Nallasivan,  Tirunelveli.    World Sparrow Day is celebrated every year on March 20 to raise awareness of house sparrows and highlight the need to conserve sparrows. On the occasion of World Sparrow Day, Pothigai Nature Club in Tirunelveli district distributed wooden sparrow boxes free of cost to government schools near Kadayanallur .They also conducted an awareness programme on sparrows for students of nearby high schools. The population of sparrow, once a very common bird, has declined markedly in most parts of the world, especially in India. Ornithologists say that the changing lifestyle has caused a significant fall in the population of house sparrows. By placing artificial nests outside our houses, we can help the sparrows have a safe place for breeding and to roost. P. Victor Selvaraj,  Palayamkottai.

Not preventing bank merger will affect BJP: Shivakumar|BELTHANGADY|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The failure of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi-Chikkamagaluru MPs Nalin Kumar Kateel and Shobha Karandlaje in preventing the merger of Vijaya Bank with Bank of Baroda will lead to their defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, Minister for Water Resources D.K. Shivakumar said here on Monday. Launching a campaign for Mithun Rai, Congress candidate in Dakshina Kannada, Mr. Shivakumar said that the two MPs have failed to take any action to prevent the merger of Vijaya Bank. More than other MPs, Mr. Shivakumar said, Mr. Kateel, Ms. Karandlaje and Union Minister D.V. Sadananada Gowda, who hail from the region, know how dear the bank was for the people here. “When it (Vijaya Bank) merged with Bank of Baroda, these three MPs should have resigned,” he said and referred to resignation by five MPs from YSR Congress in April 2018 when the Union government refused to give special category status to Andhra Pradesh. “Self-pride is more important. But these three stuck to power,” he said. District in-charge Minister U.T. Khader asked party activists to work tirelessly in the next 17 days at the booth level and ensure the victory of Mr. Rai. The former MLAs B. Ramanath Rai and Vasanth Bangera spoke. Mr. Shivakumar and other Congress leaders took part in a rally from Ayyappa Temple to the ground near Ambedkar Bhavan where the public meeting was held.

Bengaluru’s vehicle population over 80 lakh; Karnataka’s 2.1 crore|Bengaluru|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Around 1,750 new vehicles are getting registered in the city every day and the vehicle population in Bengaluru has crossed 80.45 lakh, said Transport Commissioner V.P.

During a briefing on the performance of the department in the just concluded financial year 2018-19, Mr. Ikkeri said in the previous financial year, as of March 2018, the number of vehicles registered was 74.06 lakh. New registration As per the existing provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988, it is not possible to restrict new registration of vehicles. However, in the interest of the environment, registration of e-vehicles is being promoted, he said. Across the State, the total number of vehicles registered went up to 2.1 crore as against 1.93 crore in the previous financial year. Revenue target The Transport Department has managed to reach the revenue target fixed by the State government. The department generated revenue of Rs. 6,168.58 crore against a target of Rs. 6,167.61 crore due to increased registration of new vehicles. However, revenue from State-run road transport corporations, like KSRTC and BMTC, fell short of the target. The department is expecting revenue of Rs. 359.48 crore against a target of Rs. 488.81crore. The department had imposed penalties amounting to Rs. 160 crore for various offences.  Implementation of HSRP The transport commissioner said that the Union government has issued notifications for implementation of rules on high security registration plates (HSRP) for vehicles manufactured from April 1, and it is the responsibility of manufactures to provide high security registration plates. Officials maintained that the rules do not apply for vehicles that are registered. “It is a discretionary power of the State government to introduce the rule to already registered vehicles, but as of now the matter is before a court of law,” Mr. Ikkeri said. He added that after March 2020, vehicles with two-stroke engines will be banned. Vehicle owners must shift to four-stroke engines prior to the deadline.

Manjunath, a retired Superintendent of a government college, said that the visit of Water Resources Minister D.K.

Death on film set: stunt manager arrested|Bengaluru|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|A day after kin of the victims protested against police inaction in the film shoot tragedy case, the Bagalur police on Monday arrested 55-year-old Subhash, stunt manager of the Kannada movieRanam. Bystanders Sumera Bhanu, 29, and her five-year-old daughter Ahera Khan were killed while eight-year-old Zainab was severely injured on Friday when a scene involving a car exploding went horribly wrong during the shooting of the film at the Bengaluru Aerospace Park SEZ at Bagalur. Subhash was in charge of assembling the set and executing the scene. He had fled, along with other members of the film crew, after the accident. A special police team, which was formed to track down the accused, found him at Kengeri, Kala Krishnaswamy, DCP (North-East) said. Subhash has been taken into custody. He, along with the film crew, was supposed to get permission for the shoot. But due to time constraints, they neglected to do so, a senior police officer said. Moreover, the accused had not taken any safety measures before plotting the shoot, which was dangerous in nature, he added. The prime accused Vijayan, who is a stunt director, was in a hurry to catch a flight at 7 p.m. after finishing the scene. The police alerted security personnel at the airport. However, Vijayan left for Chennai by road. The police are now on the lookout for Vijayan, producer Shrinivas R. of R.S. Production, director Samudram V., production manager Kiran, and others.

The family had got down to watch the action when the accident occurred.

HC notice to police on MLA’s bail plea|Bengaluru|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The High Court of Karnataka on Monday ordered issue of notice to the police on a petition filed by J.N. Ganesh, MLA for Kampli, seeking release on bail in the criminal case registered against him for assaulting and allegedly attempting to kill Anand Singh, Vijayanagara MLA, at a resort on the outskirts of the city in January. Justice B.A. Patil, before whom Mr. Ganesh’s petition came up for hearing, adjourned further hearing till April 8. The Special Court, exclusively to deal with criminal cases related to MPs/MLAs in Karnataka, on March 25 rejected his plea for grant of bail while observing that “prima facieit is established by the prosecution at this stage that the accused is involved in the commission of offences against the complainant”. Claiming that the investigation in the case was almost complete and he had been in custody for more than a month, it was contended in the petition that injuries suffered by Mr. Singh were minor in nature and the case on hand was blown out of proportion and there is certainly not a case for alleged attempt to murder.

‘Bengaluru needs mobility; there is a need to de-congest the city’|Bengaluru|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Rizwan Arshad, the Congress candidate for Member of Parliament, will be facing off against P.C. Mohan (BJP), incumbent MP, for the Bengaluru Central constituency. The 39-year old NSUI leader, who is among the younger faces in the Lok Sabha elections, had lost to Mr. Mohan, a two-time MP, in the 2014 elections. This time around, he believes that “people are ready for change.” Mr. Arshad expressed support for the controversial elevated flyover project, but was quick to add that there was a need for wider consultation from citizens. You are pitted against a candidate who has been elected twice. How hard is your road ahead? Although he has won the elections two consecutive times, he has not delivered on his promises. People want change. Also, this time, I am the candidate from not just the Congress but the JD(S) too as it has decided to support us. What will be your priorities if you are elected as MP? I promise to be a vocal voice for Bengaluru city. The basic issues that need to be addressed are traffic, water, basic development and infrastructure. The IT corridor pays a lot of taxes but there is no development along that stretch. We need to bring in new projects and investments to the city. I promise to be a catalyst between the Union and State governments. I also feel that Bengaluru needs mobility and there is a need to de-congest the city. Why have political parties not fielded too many candidates below the age of 40? Politics has become a complex process and we are in an extremely polarised situation in the country. It has become about money and muscle power. Parties want to field candidates who can win an election. But our party president Rahul Gandhi wants more youngsters to get into politics. Not too many Muslim candidates have been given tickets to contest the elections. Is there resentment among the community? Social justice and inclusion are balancing factors in society. I agree that not many from minority communities are getting opportunities. Things will change for the better, but there is no resentment among the community.  Parties want to field candidates who can win an election. But our party president Rahul Gandhi wants more youngsters to get into politics.

Woman security guard of State home for girls arrested|Bengaluru|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|A 17-year-old girl, who escaped from the State government home for girls in Kanakapura and was later traced to a house in Chikkabalapura, led to the exposure of a sex racket involving a woman security guard. Based on her statement, the police arrested Bhagyamma, 39, a security guard of the home, and her friend Sarojamma, 46, who stayed close to the centre. Sarojamma allegedly offered her house to run the scandal. On Sunday, officials of the Karnataka State Legal Services Authority visited the home to take stock of the situation. According to the police, in March, the girl, who had eloped twice and was rescued and rehabilitated at the centre, was taken to Kanakapura for job oriented training. She managed to escape from the centre a few days ago. Following a complaint, the police managed to track her down to the house of Sarojamma. The victim was later handed over to the CWC for counselling where she claimed that she would often be taken to Sarojamma's house and had been sexually abused many times. Efforts are on to track down Sarojamma’s male friend who is on the run, a police officer said. Chikkaballapura SP Santosh Babu said that they have registered a case under sections of the POCSO Act, and for kidnapping and rape.

RTOs to keep vigil on bus operators ferrying voters for free on eve of polls|Bengaluru|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Transport Department will keep a strict vigil on private bus operators ferrying people from the city to various destinations on the eve of election day. Transport Commissioner V.P. Ikkeri told presspersons on Monday that any offer of free transport for voters is a violation of the model code of conduct and the department would initiate action against such operators. During the time of elections, political parties ‘lure’ voters by providing free transportation to their destinations. He said RTOs have been directed to keep an eye on transporters who charge exorbitant fares to ferry passengers one or two days prior to the elections. However, despite the warning, some ticket-booking sites show that operators have steeply increased fares for passengers who want to travel on the night of April 17. For example, the ticket fare from the city to Mangaluru and Udupi has gone up from around Rs. 800 to Rs. 1,700 a seat. Mr. Ikkeri said that approximately 7,000 private buses and a large number of KSRTC buses are being used for election purposes. To take advantage of the scarcity of buses, some operators may charge hefty fares. RTOs have been asked to initiate action against such errant operators.

‘Lok Sabha election results will impact coalition government’|Bengaluru|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee working president Eshwar Khandre, who will also be contesting as the party’s nominee from Bidar, spoke toThe Hinduabout what the coming Lok Sabha elections mean for Karnataka. The three-time legislator from Bhalki in Bidar and Secretary General of Veerashaiva Mahasabha also feels that the Lok Sabha results in the State will have repercussions on the coalition government. Is the alliance with JD(S) an advantage at all to Congress or it is being seen as a burden? The alliance with JD(S) is an advantage for both parties. The Congress is expected gain in Chitradurga, Mysuru and Bagalkote. Similarly JD(S) will gain in Tumakuru, Hassan and Mandya. We expect a chunk of Lingayats who have been supporting JD(S) to support us in the seat sharing arrangement in Central and North Karnataka. Will Veerashaivas/ Lingayats back Congress this time? Have they put behind the Veerashaiava-Lingayat issue? Definitely. I have seen a majority of Lingayats supporting us in Jamkhandi (byelections). If taken into confidence and given programmes, they will be with us. A majority of Lingayats will vote for Congress. Lingayats- Veerashaiavas are one and the same, and they are secular. Political parties should keep this issue away from politics. Given your place in Veerashaiva Mahasabha, is choosing you to contest the party’s strategy to send a signal to the community? No. It has nothing to do with it. The party did not consider it that way. The selection was done based on the virtue of our loyalty to the party and the work for the people of our constituency. It could be a mere coincidence. Will this election be a kind of referendum for the Congress-JD(S) alliance and the coalition government itself? I cannot say if this will be a referendum on the performance of the government or the alliance. But the Lok Sabha results will have an impact on the alliance government here. The success of the alliance depends on the results. If the results go haywire, the impact will be on the (coalition) government. Post Pulwama, do you think perception towards parties has changed on the ground? Is it a disadvantage to the Congress? I can’t say whether it will be disadvantage to Congress. But the perception has changed post Pulwama. However, the public memory is short. In the past also, during the Congress UPA rule, such strikes have taken place. The BJP is trying to utilise Pulwama in its favour. Slowly, this is changing. By the time you go for the elections, the real issues of the country and the failure of the Union government will come to the fore.
Private schools yet to display fee structure on notice boards|Bengaluru|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Admissions in most private schools are nearing completion, but many managements are yet to display the fee structure on their notice board or on the website. This has angered several parent groups who are planning to approach the Department of Public Instruction to urge them to take suo motu action against schools that are violating the rule to display the fees. The move was initiated by the department to promote transparency between the parents as well as school managements. A parent, who is part of a parent teacher association of a school affiliated to Central Board of Secondary Education, said, “We complained to the school management and urged them to display the fee structure. They are refusing to do so, and are stating that the State government has no control over them.” Mullahalli Suri, president of Parents' Association, said that displaying the fees would help parents as they would admit students in schools where they can afford the fees. “It also helps parents as once the fees is fixed, they will not be asked for money under different sub-heads in the middle of the academic year,” he said. Senior officials in the Department of Public Instruction pointed out that the Karnataka Education Act 1983 was amended to bring CBSE and ICSE schools under the ambit of the State government in matters pertaining to fee structure, and aspects pertaining to safety and security of children. However, the Department of Public Instruction’s initiative to get schools to upload the fee structure in the department’s portal is yet to materialise. D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary, Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, claimed that a majority of the “budget” schools had put up the fee structure on the website. “Schools are having difficulty in calculating their per child expenditure because the State government has not reimbursed the tuition fee for students studying under the RTE quota. Knowing the reimbursement amount is essential to determine the fees of each child,” he said, adding that schools had calculated the fees using a rough estimate. On many top schools in the city not even putting up the approximate fees for the 2019-2020 academic year. he said, “This is a failure of the government agencies. There is need for them to improve their monitoring mechanism.”


Independent candidates allege partiality|Bengaluru|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The meeting was to inform candidates contesting in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls from Bengaluru North constituency about the expenditure limit and procedures to be followed whilst submitting accounts to be verified. However, the election officials were in for a surprise as they faced a volley of questions from a handful of independent candidates and their election agents. On Monday, as Election Expenditure Observers Vibhor Badoni and Rakesh Kumar Suman apprised the candidates about the various procedures to be followed, the candidates sought to know why the election expenditure for the various political parties was not capped. They also complained about various organisations organising events to ‘campaign’ for parties that subscribe to similar ideology. “How are election officials allowing such events to be held? Some organisations are openly backing candidates of certain parties; they are visiting religious institutions and speaking to voters on behalf of them (candidates). Will the expense of organising such events be brought under that candidate’s account or the party account?” they asked. Many Independents present also lamented about the lack of a proper complaint redressal system. “We are made to run from pillar to post seeking permission even to print pamphlets to be distributed during our campaign. Somehow, these rules don’t apply to either regional or national parties,” they charged. Election officials, while acknowledging the issues raised, said the election squads had been instructed to watch out for any public events, organised not just by parties. Later, Mr. Badoni and Mr. Suman directed the officials to get a response from the district administration about the various issues and complaints raised by the candidates and submit a report. They warned them that there should be no deviations in the working of the machinery with an objective to conduct fair, transparent and clean elections.  Expenditure limit Earlier, D.S. Hanumanthe Gowda, Assistant Expenditure Observer, reiterated that the expenditure limit for all candidates was Rs. 70 lakh. Candidates have to maintain a record of all expenses and submit their expenditure accounts for verification on April 4, 8, 12 and 16. He said the accounts of the candidates would be verified and tallied with the shadow expenditure register.

‘Pay teachers as per RTE Act’|Bengaluru|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The DPI has urged schools to pay teachers according to the norms mandated under the RTE Act. According to the RTE Act, primary teachers should be paid at least Rs. 25,800 per month, high school teachers Rs. 33,450, non teaching staff — first division clerk Rs. 27,650, second division clerk Rs. 21,400 and group D group employees Rs. 17,000. Private schools have objected. The Associated Management of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka said that most private budget schools collect fees in the range of Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 30,000 per child. “Increasing salaries will force us to increase the fees,” said a member of the association. The DPI has also asked schools to disclose the fee details on their website and on the school premises with details of the fee collected and the basic facilities available in the school. The schools have been asked to submit the same to Block Education Officers by April 15.

Women traffic personnel to get prominent roles|Bengaluru|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|A list of grievances and wishes as part of the recent International Women’s Day celebrations has led the Bengaluru Traffic Police (BTP) to initiate a series of measures that will see women donning prominent roles in the force. The first among them is the appointment of a woman traffic police personnel as a writer at Madiwala station, which is a crucial post of maintaining records and jotting down details of investigations and managing the correspondence pertaining to the station. Special parade In a programme held recently, the BTP for the first time organised a special women traffic police parade at CAR grounds where as many as 325 personnel took part. Many women personnel aired their grievances during the meeting and said they should also be given important work. As a result, it was decided to post them at important junctions across the city to manage traffic, which has so far been managed by their male counterparts. Apart from this, the department has selected around 25 women personnel from 600 staff who will be sent for training in IT skills. After successful completion of training, they will be deputed in the computer section of police stations.  Equal opportunities These initiatives will ensure gender equality, responsibility and equal opportunities, said Additional Commissioner of Police (Traffic) P. Harishekaran. The women personnel had also asked for training in driving two-wheelers and four-wheelers, which has been agreed to, Mr. Harishekaran said. The staff requested separate washroom facilities at stations, sunglasses and for inclusion of their family members in the health scheme, he said. “Based on their request, we have decided to arrange separate washroom facilities at four police stations,” he said. In addition, a request for internal transfers by new mothers and pregnant staff, who need time for rest and to feed their babies, will be looked into, he said. “If there is no immediate solution available, such staff members will be allowed extra hours to nurse their babies,” Mr. Harishekaran added. There were also complaints of ‘rude behaviour’ by male personnel. "I am warning all inspectors that this type of behaviour will not be tolerated. Disciplinary action will be initiated against those found guilty," Mr. Harishekaran said.

After amalgamation, BoB promises enhanced service and facilities|MANGALURU|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Bank of Baroda, after amalgamation with Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank on Monday, made an attempt to assuage ruffled feelings of customers and employees saying that the second largest public sector bank in the country will only herald improved services to customers and facilities to employees. Speaking to reporters here, BoB’s Deputy General Manager Lalit Tyagi said that the bank plans to build upon the strengths of the three banks and improve operations by deepening relations with a wider customer base. The amalgamation has created a wider network of branches, particularly in the western and southern States with 22 % market share in Gujarat and between 8-10% share in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. There would be over 9,500 branches, 13,400 ATMs, 85,000 employees, 120 million customers and Rs. 15 lakh crore total business after the amalgamation. Mr. Tyagi said that customers of all the three banks would experience superior banking services and benefit from a wider product range, including cash management solution, supply chain financing and wealth management.

Administration yet to decide on NHAI’s plea for closing down Kulur bridge|MANGALURU|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|National Highways Authority of India’s pleas to close down the dilapidated old arch bridge across the Phalguni on National Highway 66 at Kulur that takes traffic from Udupi-side towards Mangaluru for safety reasons are yet to be heeded by the Dakshina Kannada district administration. The arch bridge constructed in 1952 has outlived its existence, NHAI had told the administration in a series of letters. Consultants hired by the Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways to examine the bridge’s stability have said that various components of the bridge have either become weak or corroded thereby rendering it unsafe. At the present condition, the bridge can take up to 30 tonnes of load with vehicular speeds restricted to 15-20 kmph and there is no scope for its further repair, the consultant said. As such, it proposed re-construction of the bridge. Stating that Dakshina Kannada MP Nalin Kumar Kateel had sought its reconstruction because of the poor condition, NHAI told the administration that a detailed project report for construction of a new six-lane bridge between the two existing bridges is almost ready. The new bridge would be part of six-laning the Nanthoor-NITK Surathkal Port Connectivity Project Road being taken up by New Mangalore Port Road Company, of which New Mangalore Port Trust too is a stakeholder. NHAI’s Regional Office in Bengaluru recently wrote to the district administration saying that the detailed project report and tender documents are likely to be ready by April-end. Construction of the new bridge would take atleast 18-24 months, including the tendering process, it said. As such, the office sought the administration’s order to shut down the old bridge for traffic in view of its dilapidated condition and arranging for alternative routes for vehicles.  Alternative route The NHAI has proposed to allow two-way traffic on the new bridge across the Phalguni [that carries traffic from Mangaluru towards Udupi] for commercial vehicles up to 16-wheels. Commercial vehicles with more than 16-wheels, on both directions (North and South), may be diverted via Surathkal-Kana-Bajpe-KPT, NHAI said. Meanwhile, light vehicles from Udupi towards Mangaluru may continue to use the old arch bridge, the authority said. The Subrahmanya Temple at Kulur comes on the alignment of the proposed six-lane bridge and both NHAI and the administration would have to resolve the issue.

Congress candidate questioned over stand on surgical strike|YADGIR|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|BJP MLA Narasimha Naik came down heavily on Raichur Lok Sabha Congress candidate B.V. Naik for questioning the surgical strike conducted by India on terrorist camps in Pakistan and said that Mr. B.V. Naik might be having a special concern for Pakistan instead of praising the army for the action on terror. He was addressing a press conference in Yadgir on Monday. Mr. Narasimha Naik, who was here to attend a meeting of party workers, said that Mr. B.V. Naik had questioned the surgical strike by India saying that Pakistan is a small nation. He had also asked why Prime Minister Narendra Modi had taken such a decision. Does Mr. B.V. Naik understand what a surgical strike is and why it was carried out? When did he go to Pakistan to know whether it was a small and poor country? Mr. Narasimha Naik asked.

Over 3,000 voter applications rejected in Mahadevapura|K.V. Aditya Bharadwaj|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The struggle of Whitefield residents to get onto the electoral rolls continues with 3,140 of the 6,284 new online applications made since January this year being rejected. The rejections have been made without any reason, residents allege. Million Voter Rising, a campaign by Whitefield Rising to get residents onto the rolls, saw similar challenges in the run-up to the State Assembly elections in 2018.The Hinduhad reported on the issue in September 2017. Chief Electoral Officer Sanjiv Kumar conducted a surprise inspection in March 2018 and found the rejection rate of online applications in Mahadevapura during 2012-2018 to be abnormally high – 66%, prompting him to order a review of all rejected applications. However, the problem persists in the constituency, as is evident with the persistently high rejection rate in the recent voter registration drive as well. “While we want to believe this is owing to a breakdown of the system, there is also a nagging suspicion that there seems to be an effort to disenfranchise some of us,” said Anjali Saini, a volunteer of Million Voter Rising. Procedural lapses Volunteers of Million Voter Rising also allege that applicants have been robbed of a chance to appeal and defend their application. Rule 19 of Registration of Electors Rules, 1960, mandates that the authorities issue a notice of inquiry to the claimants and issue Form 12 for the same. The rule stipulates that an opportunity must be accorded to the parties concerned and a time of 30 days given for the same. “The AEROs have failed to issue notices under Form 12. Further, without issuing the requisite forms, they have rejected various applications, robbing applicants of the chance to defend their claims,” Ms. Saini said. K.N. Ramesh, Additional Chief Electoral Officer, Karnataka, said that issuing of Form 12 was mandatory and the CEO office had repeatedly instructed the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) officials to do the same. “The BBMP has assured us that they are issuing Form 12,” he said. However, the residents of Whitefield allege that the BBMP is not doing so. BBMP Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad, also the District Electoral Officer (DEO), said there were many duplications in online applications and hence the rejection rate was high. However, Million Voter Rising carried out a random search for the applications rejected and most of them had not made it to the electoral rolls. If most of the rejections were of duplicate applications, at least one of them must have found its way to the rolls, they argue.

Creating voter awareness through colours, paintings|HUBBALLI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|This election season while the respective government authorities are striving to sensitise voters, some voluntary organisations too have taken up the responsibility of spreading the message. A group of professionals, both young and old, has taken up an initiative in Hubballi to beautify the city. Its primary goal is to prevent defacement of public spaces and beautify them by colouring and through paintings. And, as it is election season, the group members thought of using the initiative to create awareness on voting and have painted a public space with an appeal to the public to vote. So, they got a few like-minded artists Rakesh Toppagi, Ghouse, Naseem, Naveen, Nagraj and others to get it done. First, the volunteers cleaned the defaced wall, near the bus depot in Hubballi. And, then got the wall painted with a message to everyone highlighting the significance of voting. Professionals Sachin Hoskatti, V.B. Nitali, Mahesh Gadag and Jeetendra Shigehalli are too part of the initiative. “This initiative is part of beautifying the city and also spreading the message that every vote counts,” said founder of Colour My City Kiran Uppar. According to Mr. Kiran, there is a need for sensitising the young voters as they are not serious about exercising their franchise. “Our idea is to motivate them to take interest in politics and also ensure that the city looks clean,” he said. ‘This initiative is part of beautifying the city and also spreading the message that every vote counts’ ‘This initiative is part of beautifying the city and also spreading the message that every vote counts’

3 surveillance squad officials suspended|Shivamogga|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Three officials who were part of a surveillance squad in Shikaripur taluk for prevention of violation of the model code of conduct during the Lok Sabha election have been kept under suspension on charges of dereliction of duty.

Unprecedented face-off in Hassan with Congress-JD(S) uniting to fight BJP|Hassan|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Hassan Lok Sabha constituency, which is known for launching politicians of State-wide and national stature, is now set to witness an unprecedented poll battle. Not only have the Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular) — traditional rivals in the region — united to fight against the Bharatiya Janata Party for the first time, the third generation of former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda’s family has entered the fray in the Vokkaliga heartland. The patriarch has stepped aside to let grandson Prajwal Revanna, 28, “carry on his legacy.” Mr. Revanna has before him the task of retaining the constituency won by his grandfather no less than five times. He is taking on former Minister A. Manju, who was defeated by Mr. Deve Gowda in the 2014 elections with a margin of over one lakh votes. The JD(S) holds a formidable position in the constituency, with six out of Hassan’s eight MLAs from the party. The party has won the seat continuously since 1991, except once in 1999, with the Congress as its principal Opposition in all these elections. Now, with the Congress and JD(S) having come together “formally”, simple arithmetic suggests the candidate of the coalition partners should win hands down. But the JD(S) leaders know that transfer of Congress votes to the JD(S) candidate is not easy as staunch followers of the two parties barely get along with each other. The differences are especially visible in the joint meetings held in the taluks. In fact, two alliances are fighting each other in Hassan. While that of the JD(S)-Congress is a formal alliance, an informal alliance has taken shape between the BJP and disgruntled Congress workers. The BJP has fielded Mr. Manju, who fought the 2014 Lok Sabha poll on Congress ticket. While a few senior leaders have resolved to remain neutral, his candidature has caused many to shift their allegiance to the BJP. A senior Congress leader, who refused to be named, said: “We are caught between the devil and the deep blue sea. We have no option but to remain neutral.” Recently, some leaders of the Dalit Sangharsha Samiti, including artist K.T. Shivaprasad, declared their support to Mr. Manju, irrespective of the party to which he belonged. They cited atrocities faced by Dalits at the hands of JD(S) supporters all these years as the reason for their allegiance to him. They have also made it clear that such a decision was taken because of the absence of a Congress candidate. Neither party, however, is discussing national issues in an election meant to send a representative to Parliament. The JD(S), campaigning under the leadership of Public Works Minister H.D. Revanna, wants people to vote considering development projects taken up under its rule. The BJP, with its two Hassan MLAs Preetham Gowda and Belli Prakash, is making all efforts to win over anti-JD(S) votes. It accuses theJD(S) of ignoring Dalit politicians and making concerted efforts to defeat the Backward Class Congress leaders like former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah in the last Assembly election. By raising these issues, the party wants to win over people who have been traditionally opposed to the JD(S). Whether the BJP wins or loses in the battle, it’s certain to widen its base in the constituency, thanks to the Congress-JD(S) alliance. The JD(S) candidate can win only if the Congress succeeds in transferring its votes to its partner. Otherwise, the alliance will end up helping the BJP, defeating the very purpose of forming it.

Villagers take out bike rally for water|Hassan|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Residents of Mathighatta and Juttanahalli Gram Panchayats in Channarayapatna taluk took out a bike rally for about 15 km on Monday, demanding water for the tanks in the two panchayats. The residents of these villages have threatened to boycott the elections if their demands were not addressed. The protesters began the rally from Mathighatta and covered Juttanahali, Hirisave, Arekere and Sorekayipura and neighbouring villages. They said they have been demanding water supply to the tanks for the last 30 years, but it remained unfulfilled. The project to fill up tanks was planned when H.C. Srikantaiah was a Minister 15 years ago. However, the project did not materialise. The people have been suffering without drinking water supply in the villages. Suresh, a leader of Raitha Sangha, said the protest would be intensified if the people’s representatives failed to address the problem.

Crafts a must for livelihood in rural areas, says Prasanna|MANIPAL|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Prasanna, theatre director and social activist, inaugurated the Kamala Gallery in the memory of doyenne of handicrafts, Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay, while Gita Ram, Chairperson, Crafts Council of India, Chennai, inaugurated the Vijaynath Shenoy Memorial Hall at the Heritage Village here on Monday. The gallery has 40 photographs related to Kamaladevi. Mr. Prasanna said that Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay was a national leader and a multi-faceted responsible for saving handlooms and handicrafts. The dilemma facing the crafts sector was whether it should be a souvenir sector as China was doing or as a sector which produced items largely for consumption in villages of the country and to some extent in the cities. Mr. Prasanna said that India had been imitating China in the last two decades. With the result, in some cases in the crafts sector, some had introduced machinery for producing souvenirs. “I don’t think this is what either Gandhiji or Kamaladevi envisaged. It is possible to revive crafts as a living tradition. Only then it can become a substantial sector providing livelihood and not just a market for souvenirs,” he said. Handlooms and handicrafts could provide the maximum number of jobs for rural women and men. Gandhiji had emphasised on the moral and ethical aspect of this sector and wanted people to go back to it, he said. Emphasising that environment was the third imperative to promote the crafts sector, Mr. Prasanna said: “We have to de-construct the automation industry step by step and we have to get back to our hand-making traditions. It is only then there will be less violence, less competition and a better world for our children.” Rajesh Pai, Trustee of Hasta Shilpa Trust, said that Kamaladevi’s first married home in Mangaluru would soon be reconstructed at Heritage Village at a cost of Rs. 2.88 crore.

No hotel room in Shivamogga for those skipping voting|Shivamogga|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The authorities in Shivamogga Lok Sabha constituency seem to be going an extra mile to ensure that no one skips voting on election days. Deputy Commissioner of Shivamogga K.A. Dayanand has directed authorities to ask owners of hotels and resorts in the district not to book rooms for tourists coming from constituencies that are going to polls on April 18 and 23. This has been necessitated because many voters are seen to be holidaying instead of exercising their franchise in the “festival of democracy”, states the reminder issued by him on April 1. There are a series of holidays in between the dates. Mr. Dayanand has said that the EPIC card and home address should be verified before rooms are allotted to tourists. Fourteen constituencies go to polls on April 18 and the remaining 14 on April 23. Rooms should not be allotted on April 18 for residents of the districts that go for polling in first phase and on April 23 for the residents of the places where polling will be held in the second phase, he said.

Software glitch affects property registrations|MYSURU|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Property registration and other services at the Sub-Registrar Office (South) at Ramakrishna Nagar ‘I’ Block near Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa Circle here have come to a full stop since past three days over a software malfunction. IT professionals could not detect the fault that prevented scanning of documents in the beginning but have now managed to locate the cause for the error. The public were severely inconvenienced as registrations had been affected, especially during the end of financial year. The busy office wore a deserted look with services coming to a halt. Mysuru District Registrar Vijayalakshmi Inamdar toldThe Hinduthat the ‘glitch’ had been detected and will be attended to by software professionals. Fee payments “Hopefully, by Tuesday, the problems will be resolved and normal services will be resumed,” she said. Ms. Inamdar said the system was not accepting scanning of documents, resulting in the disruption. The Inspector General of Registration and the Commissioner of Stamps has issued an order for restoring the glitch, roping in software professionals for overcoming the issues. “A team of Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) will work on the software and get the problems resolved soon,” Ms. Inamdar said. Fee payments Also, the Sub-Registrar Offices of both North and South were been facing the problem with regard to the acceptance of fees - stamp duty, cess and registration costs - paid by the public in the form of demand draft (DD) if Khajane-2 Software encountered any error. “Raising challans towards the payment of fees had been made mandatory instead of payment through the DD since over one-and-a-half months. There is no alternative mode if challans were not accepted by the software. Only the North and South offices were facing this problem while the system was functioning without any hitch in West and East offices in Mysuru,” according to sources. The public can get their DDs refunded immediately with the banks in case of an error or disruption in registrations but challans have to be refunded only at the government level, which used to take time. “There were a number of challans pending for reimbursement. Until the software becomes stable, some alternatives need to be worked out to prevent interruptions and disruptions in extending routine services at the offices,” they suggest. However, Ms Inamdar said the issue over Khajane-2 software faced by the two Sub-Registrar offices has not come to her knowledge.

3 electrocuted in Kodagu|MYSURU|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Three persons were electrocuted when they came in contact with a live power line at a plantation in Kodagu district on Monday.

cVigil app: SVEEP teams to guide mobile users|MYSURU|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|With the c-Vigil mobile App (launched by the Election Commission to curb violation of model code of conduct) apparently not getting the kind of response expected, volunteers from SVEEP will work towards making it an effective and popular tool for posting short videos and photographs on electoral malpractices the people come across. The SVEEP teams that have spread across Mysuru district have been asked assist the public in downloading the mobile application in their smart phones from Google Playstore and demonstrate its operations for posting the complaints since many were still not responsive about the tool and the rationale behind its launch. “Wherever the teams are camping, they will be assisting those having smart phones to download the app and highlight its use in a bid to make it useful tool for preventing poll code violations and expenditure limit,” sources said. It has come to light that public were making use of the voter helpline 1950 to lodge complaints. This toll-free helpline was launched to aid voters with a range of services including information on electoral roll, polling stations and so on. As it was easy for the public to make a call instead of using an app, the helpline is said to have been receiving more calls from voters. Many had lodged complaints which were directed to the respective election officers. With more than two weeks left for the elections, the people engaged in educating the public on compulsory voting as a part of SVEEP have been asked to help the voters know more about the app, its use and its functions. Also, a singer from Mysuru, Harsha, and humorist and writer Krishne Gowda have been roped as ambassadors for SVEEP activities in Mysuru district and they shall be touring the district spreading the message of compulsory voting besides the new initiatives such as c-Vigil app. In the beginning, the complaints posted on the c-Vigil (Citizen Vigil) turned out to be sham and unrelated with people uploading photographs and videos of their home, ‘jathre’, family pictures, old newspaper cuttings on past elections, old poll posters and so on. Many had posted their selfies, discomforting the staff deployed to monitor the content. The app was launched with the purpose of tracking violations of the model code and election expenditure limit, encouraging citizens to report violations to the poll officials for curbing electoral malpractices. The app has the choice for uploading photographs and short videos on what the citizens believe to be “violations” of model code from the spot along with location-based info. The EC took the app-route to engage the citizens in the election process. A dedicated c-Vigil control room had been established at the Deputy Commissioner’s office here to attend to the app-based complaints and address them within 100 minutes from the time of receipt.

A mission to aid autistic children bears fruit|KOCHI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Autism Care Centre in Thrissur, set up four years ago, has sent five children to normal schools after training them for three years. They joined Class I at various schools last year. “This was possible because they were sent to the centre when they were three years old,” said Ravi A.S., president of Autism Society, Thrissur, and caretaker of the centre which is run by the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and the Thrissur Corporation. These children with supportive care at home and school are expected to complete schooling with average ratings unless there is a break in the support system or any extreme event. Breakthrough It is a major breakthrough in inclusive education for autism spectrum disorders, a neurodevelopment disorder. A survey conducted by Autism Society had found that there were as many as 110 autistic children in 86 schools in the district. The disorder varies from person to person, and each individual requires support in accordance with the needs. It comes under a spectrum of mental health disorders, and it can be managed only by keen observation of the child and understanding his/her needs, Mr. Ravi said. While intermingling of children is crucial in the growing-up stage, autistic children cannot be trained along with those with other disabilities as they shy away from eye contact and social interaction. They prefer to sit alone and do not speak even if they hear someone calling out to them. “It is these particular behaviours that we first need to decode in each child at a young age and prepare them to attend normal schools. Training them along with children with other disabilities will only make them go backward,” said Mr. Ravi. The aim of the centre is to make autistic children self-dependent, he added. Besides toilet training, washing, cleaning, and eating, the children are offered money management training too by taking them for shopping. “We have adults too [over 18 years] at the centre who come here for training. Other therapies like Yoga and meditation too are provided.” “An important aspect of training is that parents should associate with the children as autism is incurable. However, it can be managed by minimising the disorder by up to 80%,” Mr. Ravi said.  Autism can be managed only by keen observation of the child and understanding his/her needs Ravi A.S. President, Autism Society, Thrissur

Door-to-door visits to enthuse voters|Shivamogga|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Under the Systematic Voters’ Education and Electoral Participation (SVEEP) campaign, the district administration will create awareness on the importance of voting through door-to-door visits.

Case filed against Rema|Kozhikode|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|A case was registered against K.K. Rema, Revolutionary Marxist Party leader and wife of slain party founder T.P. Chandrasekharan, for allegedly calling CPI(M) leader P. Jayarajan, the LDF’s Vadakara parliamentary candidate, a murderer. The case was registered under Section 171G (false statement in connection with an election) of the Indian Penal Code based on the order of Vadakara Judicial First Class Magistrate Court on Monday. This was after CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan filed a complaint with the Election Commission of India and the State Electoral Officer seeking action against her under the Model Code of Conduct. Her statement, Mr. Balakrishnan alleged, misled the voters and tried to defame the LDF candidate. He also requested to prevent Ms. Rema from making such statements in future. However, UDF leaders have come out in support of Ms. Rema saying that those who murdered her husband were now tormenting her. Congress leader K. Muraleedhran, MLA, who is contesting from Vadakara, said the case would be handled legally. He said the government was trying to intimidate those who spoke the truth. This election focussed on the issue of political violence, he added.

Over 100 seek treatment for sunburn|Kozhikode|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Eleven people sought treatment for sunburns in the district on Monday, taking the total number of people who were hit by the soaring mercury levels in Kozhikode since March first week to 102. According to the Health Department, seven of them are men and others are women. They are from Maniyoor, Thodannoor, Meppayyur, Peruvayal, Onchiyam, Beypore, Thiruvallur, Naduvannur, Panangad, and Theekkuni. The maximum temperature recorded here on Monday was 36.3 degrees Celsius, 2.8 degrees Celsius above normal. The minimum temperature was 26.8 degrees Celsius, 0.6 degrees Celsius above normal. Holiday declared Meanwhile, the India Meteorological Department has said that the maximum temperature is very likely to be above normal by 2 degrees Celsius to 3 degree Celsius in Kozhikode on Tuesday. The District Collector has declared a holiday for Kendriya Vidyalaya-1 and Kendriya Vidyalaya-2 on Tuesday too. Exploiting workers Even after a directive from the Private Building Contractors’ Association (PBCA) on noticing the violation of summertime work rearrangement, a number of private agencies are still employing migrant labourers for outdoor duties at construction sites during ‘sunstroke’ hours. Though the special squads constituted by the Labour Department have been on the field to track such practices, not many cases have been exposed. Some contracting agencies have claimed that workers were reluctant to cooperate with alternative shift arrangements and that labourers were voluntarily taking up jobs during the restricted summer work hours. It was the district committee of PBCA that first expressed its concern over the practice and urged builders and contractors to strictly comply with the mid-day break between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. as ordered by the Labour Department. The increasing incidents of sunburn and related ailments too had prompted them to come up with an open appeal to agencies in the sector. The PCBA had pointed out that contractors were responsible for ensuring a healthy working atmosphere for labourers. It had also appealed to the contracting firms to cooperate with the alternative work arrangement between 7 a.m. and 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. It said small contracting groups formed by migrant workers were mostly violating the norms set by the Labour Department.

Motorcycle modification to invite stringent action|KOCHI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Educational institution heads who fail to take action against students who use modified bikes on the campus will now come under the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) scanner. The move comes close on the heels of the department initiating action against students of an engineering college in Ernakulam. They were found displaying modified high-end bikes at an auto show held on the campus on Monday. Cases registered “We registered cases against the violators under Section 191 of the Motor Vehicles Act for unauthorised alteration of motorbikes. Ten of the 17 altered motorbikes were produced at the Regional Transport Office at Kakkanad after restoring them to their original condition,” said K. Manoj Kumar, RTO (Enforcement), Ernakulam. Maintaining that heads of educational institutions should step up vigil, Mr. Manoj Kumar said they should not grant permission for display of modified motorbikes. The organisers of the show had even instituted a cash prize of Rs. 5,000 for the owner of the motorbike that made the loudest roaring sound. Enforcement officials said the remaining seven vehicles should be presented within a week in their original condition.

Varsities to adopt uniform calendar|THIRUVANANTHAPURAM|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The universities in the State are all set to adopt a largely uniform academic and examination calendar from next academic year onwards. The Higher Education Department has expedited steps in this direction after facing numerous complaints of delays in the examination process. The reform is being introduced for the next batch in universities that come under the purview of the department. In effect, the proposed standardisation of the entire academic process, right from admissions to the declaration of results, will be fully realised during the completion of the courses being pursued by the batch. “Starting with this year, there will be a common admission process. We intend to have uniform calendars for each courses across universities. The system will gradually fall into place within the next three years, i.e., following the graduation of the batch. While the respective schedules might not be exactly the same, there will be largely predictable dates for holding examinations and publication of results,” Usha Titus, Principal Secretary, Higher Education Department, said. Common schedule However, the steps to evolve a common academic schedule would not have any bearing on the existing supplementary examinations. “It is not feasible to prepare a uniform calendar for such examinations under the circumstances. But, if we process the declaration of results within the time period set by the universities, we will be able to address the students’ concerns to a great extent,” Dr. Titus said. While the government had commenced steps for standardising the academic schedule on the basis of a recommendation by the Kerala State Higher Education Council (KSHEC), a recent Kerala High Court order that recommended the same reform appears to have accelerated the process. However, the vehement opposition raised by a majority section of employees towards the proposed split vacation system could pose hurdles. The split vacation pattern that proposes vacation in November and May has been mooted by the KSHEC to replace the existing two-month annual vacation pattern from April to May. It was introduced in universities and colleges in 2009-10. However, it was withdrawn in 2013-14 following a report by the B. Hridayakumari Commission.

Radhakrishnan granted bail|KOCHI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Nedumbassery police on Monday recorded the arrest of A.N.

Uplifting minorities by secular means|Malappuram|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) general secretary P.K. Kunhalikutty says the IUML, as a secular party vying for the uplift of minorities and backward communities, has a great role to play at a time when the country is drifting towards fascism. How will you define your relevance in the present election? The IUML, which has always stood for secular values, has opposed attempts by a few minority forums to promote communalism. We are opposing minority communalism the best way we can. The party’s more relevant now than ever. But, you have of late been accused of trying to accost groups like the SDPI with extreme views? It’s a false allegation by the LDF. There’s no tie-up with the Social Democratic Party of India. Its State president Abdul Majeed Faizi is pitted against me in Malappuram. Does one require any other proof to validate our stand? The LDF had sought the help of the SDPI many times, and is trying to create a false discourse. From a wider perspective, what is your main plank of this election? As highlighted in the Sachar committee report, minorities in the country have a long way to go to join the mainstream of development. The IUML wants the uplift of the minorities through secular means. We stand for an inclusive growth of the minorities and backward classes. What will be your stand vis-à-vis the CPI(M) if the BJP is ousted from power? It will depend on the stand the CPI(M) takes towards the Congress. If they view the Congress and the BJP alike, it will be disastrous for the country. Such a stand will help the BJP. Will you demand a ministerial berth if the UPA comes to power? It’s too early to say anything about it. It will depend on the situation that evolves after the election. My party will discuss and decide. What impact do you think Rahul Gandhi’s candidacy in Wayanad will make in Kerala? It is a historic occasion for Kerala. People of Wayanad have got an opportunity to vote for the UPA’s prime ministerial candidate. His arrival has already boosted the prospects of the UDF in a big way. It’s said that E. Ahamed was made a Minister in the UPA regime because of his affinity to the Congress leadership. Will you get the same consideration? I was given E. Ahamed’s chair when I was elected in the by-election. There has not been any discrimination by the Congress. The IUML is very much part of the UPA.

Guidance to engg. aspirants|Thiruvananthapuram|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Margadarshi 2019 programme sequence for engineering aspirants, organised by the Mohandas College of Engineering and Technology (MCET) at Anad here, was inaugurated by Ramesh Unnikrishan, Director, All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) on Sunday. Rani Mohandas, secretary VNGP Trust, Prasad Kumar Nair, director, IMAT, Ajith Sankar, senior HRD consultant and columnist, Ashalatha Thampuran, director, MCET, S. Sheela, Principal, MCET, Vipinkumar K.C, Chief Operating Officer, MCET, and Sobha Manakkal, programme coordinator, Margadarshi, were present. Dr. Unnikrishnan emphasised the exponential need of the nation to have focused engineers who could drive the nation to prosperity. He advised the engineering aspirants to be hard working and confident and steer clear of the wrong notion that top-level institutions alone produced worthy engineers. He observed that different statistics on jobless engineers were not true. KEAM trial test JEE/KEAM Trial Test, the flagship event of Margadharshi, was conducted in association withThe Hinduand IMAT JEE/Medical Academy. The test was preceded by a fine-tuning session led by Prasad Kumar Nair, entrance coaching expert and director of IMAT. Mr. Ajith Sankar led the interactive session with parents of engineering aspirants. Individual performance assessment with counselling will be provided to the participants as a follow up. The institution announced plans to conduct outreach programmes.

Sabarimala could hold the key|PATHANAMTHITTA|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Lok Sabha constituency of Pathanamthitta, spread across the districts of Pathanamthitta and Kottayam, is set to witness a fierce tri-cornered battle of the ballot. Sitting MP Anto Antony of the Congress had a victory margin of 1,11,206 votes over the CPI(M)’s K. Ananthagopan in the 2009 polls but saw his lead nearly halved — to 56,191 — against Peelipose Thomas of the LDF in 2014. This time, Mr. Antony is making an all-out effort to raise his victory margin to that of 2009. For Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, the electoral battle in Pathanamthitta, which houses Sabarimala, is a matter of prestige against the backdrop of the controversial women’s entry issue. Sitting MLA Veena George is pitted against Mr. Antony and K. Surendran of the BJP, a popular figure among Ayyappa devotees following his involvement in the Sabarimala stir launched by the Sangh Parivar. The Supreme Court verdict permitting entry for women of all age groups to the Ayyappa temple in Sabarimala last year, and its consequences, will undoubtedly have a say in the electoral verdict here, though the Election Commission had warned the political parties against highlighting the issue while campaigning. Devotees’ role Both the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) and the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) vociferously claim to be the votaries of the faithful, pointing out their protests against the court verdict. The LDF government in the State, which executed the court order, has attempted to blunt its opponents’ charges by providing a special budget allocation for Sabarimala and ensuring better amenities at the pilgrim centre and various transit camps. This time around, the slump in rubber price is not a key poll issue. Even last year’s deluge that devastated large swathes in the constituency is unlikely to get major mileage in the electioneering. The communal equations in the constituency comprising the Assembly segments of Thiruvalla, Aranmula, Adoor, Konni, Ranni, Kanjirappally and Poonjar too will be a deciding factor. Both the Nair Service Society (NSS) and the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP) Yogam have considerable social clout here. All the fronts are hopeful of garnering these social organisations’ support. The Church factor Other determining factors are the Orthodox-Jacobite Church row and the stand adopted by various churches and Pentecostal groups towards the candidates.

Archdiocese fined Rs. 3 crore by Income Tax dept.|KOCHI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Income Tax Department has imposed a fine of Rs. 3 crore on the Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese of the Syro-Malabar Church for anomalies in some of its land transactions between April 2013 and March 2018. Church sources said that the archdiocese had already paid Rs. 50 lakh towards the fine just before the end of the financial year. Church sources did not confirm the details of the anomalies in the land transactions but said there were inconsistencies in the land sale documents. It is reported that while the land was actually registered for a particular amount, the informal agreement for the sale involved a higher amount of money, which is being construed as an effort to evade taxation. Panel submits report Meanwhile, the Joseph Injodey Commission appointed by apostolic administrator bishop Jacob Manathodath to inquire into the land deals submitted its report on Monday, said a press release from the archdiocese here. The report was submitted in a sealed cover to the bishop, who is scheduled to hand it over to Cardinal Sandri, the Prefect of the Congregation for Oriental Churches in Rome during the week. The archdiocesan land deals between 2013 and 2018 had turned into a major scandal before Pope Francis removed Cardinal George Alencherry, major archbishop, from the day-to-day affairs of the archdiocese. Bishop Manathodath was appointed apostolic administrator. It was bishop Manathodath, who appointed the committee of inquiry, which was assisted by the private audit and management consultancy KPMG. The press release said that a “reputed land valuation firm” was also appointed to value the property involved in the deals. The committee met with more than 80 respondents during the course of the inquiry, the press release added. Meanwhile, the Ernakulam-Angamaly Archdiocese denied reports that it was fined by the IT department. It was wrong to say the archdiocese had been fined, said an official communication from the archdiocese. It said that the archdiocese had paid Rs. 50 lakh as the first instalment of its tax dues for income the archdiocese had received from land sales during 2016-17.

Transgender woman found dead|Kozhikode|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|A transgender woman was found dead in the city on Monday morning. The Nadakkavu police identified her as Shalu, 35, from Kannur. The police suspected it to be a murder as a sari was seen tightly tied around the victim’s neck. The area where the body was found, UKS Road, was one of the gathering places of transgender persons in the city. In the closed-circuit surveillance camera footage collected from nearby locations, the police found two persons following her. Shalu reportedly reached the city on Saturday from Mysuru where she was staying with her other friends. Expressing shock over the incident, transgender activists in the city sought a fair investigation. They alleged that transgenders were being tortured in the name of sex work and that the police were not actively probing such incidents. Transgender activist Sisily George said Shalu had earlier spoken to her friends about incidents that reportedly put her life in trouble. “We have reasons to suspect it as a murder,” she told reporters. Jasmin, a transgender person, also came up in support of Ms. George’s argument. Urging human rights activists to take up the issue, transgender people from the district organised a candlelight protest at Mananchira in the evening. They also sought protection for the community.

Unauthorised campaign materials being removed|KOTTAYAM|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Even as electioneering by political fronts entered a crucial phase in Kottayam, authorities have launched a drive to remove the campaign materials on display in private properties without the consent of the respective property owners. The drive was launched as the deadline set for furnishing the letter of consent from the property owners to the election office expired at 5 p.m on Monday. The Collector had already issued a directive in this regard to all defacement and flying squads functioning in the district. The squads have so far removed about 1,600 campaign materials including posters, hoardings and display boards put up across the district. The election authority stipulates production of the consent letter through the village officer or the flying squads within three days of putting up a campaign material. District Collector P.K. Sudheer Babu has requested the public as well as the political parties to comply with the rules and regulations.

KSHEC says ‘no’ to private universities in State|KOCHI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Kerala State Higher Education Council (KSHEC) has recommended that the State government continue to hold its ground on the issue of allowing private universities to function in the State. A resolution to this effect was adopted at an executive body meeting of the council on March 28. The decision came after the government sought the opinion of the council on the establishment of off-campus centres of private universities in the State. “Since Kerala is determined to ensure equity, access, social justice, and inclusive development while striving to bring about quality and excellence in higher education sector, the State has been against the establishment of private universities over the years,” said the resolution. “It is the considered view of the council that regulatory functions are best entrusted with government/public agencies that are bound to abide by the policy perceptions of the State in higher education. In a State where public universities and institutions of higher education are doing well, private universities would only upset the social policy of distributive justice and the general standards of higher education with their asymmetrical academic outlook and pecuniary motives,” it added. Blames Union govt. Blaming the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development for its stance that promotion of private universities is the primary solution for boosting the gross enrolment ratio (GER), P.M. Rajan Gurukkal, vice chairman of the council, said many of the eligible candidates failed to get enrolled not because of the non-availability of institutions but due to the incumbents’ poverty and social backwardness. “Rise of private universities will upset measures to enhance equity, access and quality in higher education sector,” he said. The council also informed the government that the establishment of private universities would only affect the social policy of distributive justice, inclusive development, and general standards in higher education. Intrusion of private universities would also thwart the development of our public institutions, established with huge investment and great expectations, it said. The council also reminded the government that the programmes and courses offered by the deemed-to-be universities were only conventional ones widely prevalent in higher education institutions of the State.

Cong. destroyed secular collective, says SRP|KASARAGOD|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Communist Party of India (Marxist) Polit Bureau member S. Ramachandran Pillai has said the Congress Party has destroyed the secular collective formed at the national level by fielding party president Rahul Gandhi in Wayanad. Speaking to reporters here on Monday, Mr. Pillai said that the CPI(M) would repeat its electoral performance in 2004 when it had won the highest number of Lok Sabha seats. The Congress in the State could not hope to hang on to the shoulders of Mr. Gandhi and escape, he said. Mr. Gandhi chose to flee to Wayanad instead of strengthening the anti-BJP sentiments in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, he added. Stating that Mr. Gandhi could choose to contest from anywhere, the CPI(M) leader said that the Left was not concerned about his candidature in Wayanad. The activities of the Congress and Mr. Gandhi were similar to the extreme Hindutva stance of the BJP. Secular regional parties would form the government at the Centre this time, he said. The Congress would be left behind, he added. If the BJP could manage to come to power at the Centre again, there would be no elections in future in the country, he alleged.

Ready to accept Cong. challenge: Yechury|PATHANAMTHJITTA|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The decision of Congress president Rahul Gandhi to contest from Wayanad is against the interests of the people of the country, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury has said. Mr. Yechury was addressing a public meeting held in connection with the election campaign of Left Democratic Front candidate Veena George here on Monday. According to him, Mr. Gandhi’s decision to contest from Wayanad where the presence of BJP is very weak has given a wrong message to the people at a time when democratic forces across the country have launched a united mission to defeat the BJP and protect the secular, democratic credentials of India. If the Congress is aiming to defeat the LDF, the Left parties have accepted that challenge, he said.  ‘Landslide win’ Mr Yechury said the LDF would register a landslide win in Kerala in the ensuing polls. The CPI(M) leader said he had never advised the Congress president at any point of time to contest from South India, adding that the latter was free to contest from anywhere in the South.

Dental health care for the poor launched|PATHANAMTHITTA|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Pushpagiri College of Dental Sciences (PCDS) in Thiruvalla has rolled out a series of charity dental health-care schemes as part of the 60th anniversary celebrations of the Pushpagiri Medical Society attached to the Thiruvalla Archdiocese of the Syro- Malankara Church. Principal George Varghese toldThe Hinduthat the Department of Public Health Dentistry, Pedodontics and Preventive Dentistry and the Department of Periodontics under the leadership of Vinod Mathew Mulamoottil has obtained a grant of Rs. 16 lakh from France for prevention of dental caries named ‘SEAL-it’ in children.

Amit Shah boost to Tejasvi Surya|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|BJP national president Amit Shah, who will be visiting the State for the first time on Tuesday since elections were declared, has specifically chosen Bengaluru South Lok Sabha constituency — where the pick of candidate has caused some heartburn — to launch his campaign. He will hold a bike rally in Banashankari and address the public. The choice of place is aimed at signalling the party workers to fall in line with the high command’s choice of the candidate, sources said. This constituency saw 28-year-old Tejasvi Surya picked over Tejaswini Ananth Kumar, wife of the late Union Minister Ananth Kumar. Mr. Shah had a pre-scheduled programme in Chennai on Tuesday. He is making a special stopover in the evening in Bengaluru. He will campaign for Mr. Surya and fly to Delhi the same night, with the stopover dedicated to Bengaluru South. This not only shows how significant the seat is for the party, but also demonstrates the influence B.L. Santosh, National Joint General Secretary (Organisation) — said to be the key leader who swung the BJP’s decision in favour of Mr. Surya — has over the high command, say party sources. The visit seems to have already had an effect. All five BJP MLAs and BBMP councillors from the party in the constituency held a marathon meeting on Monday where “differences were ironed out and responsibilities assigned”, an associate of Mr. Surya said. “There was some confusion. But with Mr. Shah specially endorsing Mr. Surya, everyone has fallen in line,” he said. The State unit had unanimously recommended the name of Tejaswini Ananth Kumar for the seat. But the high command, in a surprise move, chose Mr. Surya. Several leaders including State BJP president B.S. Yeddyurappa, and V Somanna, local MLA, had expressed dismay at the decision. Ms. Ananth Kumar had also said she was yet to decide whether to campaign or not. Interestingly, Mr. Shah is not expected to call on her during his visit.

A special get-together at Regional Science Centre|Kozhikode|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|It was the first day of April, and children were coming in hordes to visit the Regional Science Centre and Planetarium to open up their minds to the wonders of science. The auditorium there, however, was alive with the presence and chatter of a group of children who are special compared with their peers. ‘Supatham 19’, the get-together of 60 bedridden, differently abled students and their parents on Monday, was an extension of the ‘Changathikkoottam’ friendship groups under the block resource centre (BRC), Kunnamangalam. The project was conceived by the Kozhikode district office of the Samagra Shiksha, to help differently abled students develop social and communicative skills with the help of their peers. It envisages creation of friendship groups involving students from the school where the differently abled child is studying. They visit the child during weekends or holidays at home to help him or her improve various skills and join the mainstream. Actor Mamukkoya opened the event and interacted with the participants. He honoured Fathima Bismi, Anugrah, and Ria Ubaid, who have overcome their disabilities to excel in different walks of life. An exhibition of paintings of Manna Fathima and Ria Ubaid too was opened. It was followed by a magic performance by Sreejith Viyyoor, mimicry performance by Rajeev Cherooppa, and a folk song performance, among others. Art teacher S. Devarajan drew illustrations of the students. ‘Nerrekha 2019’, a directory of differently abled students in Kozhikode district, was released.

Errant bikers to get MVD stick|KOCHI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Motor Vehicles Department (MVD), Ernakulam, will keep a close eye on those resorting to wheeling, race, and zig zag riding. Enforcement squads have been directed to act tough against errant bikers in view of the rising number of motorcyclists involved in bike racing and rash driving. “All enforcement squads on the ground have been alerted. We will not permit dangerous rides on high-end and modified bikes. Stringent action, including cancellation of licence, will be initiated,” warned Joji P. Jose, Regional Transport Officer, Ernakulam. The arrest of Nahas Jan, 28, of Pachalam near the Aluva bypass junction on Sunday was the latest instance of illegal biking in the district. The Aluva police said Jan was caught while riding a Rs. 14-lakh bike at 150 km/hr along the national highway. He was spotted overspeeding near Pulinchodu junction and was nabbed from the Aluva bypass junction. The violator was later released on bail. The police said the bike would be released only after the accused remitted the fine fixed by the court for rash and negligent driving. Racers often take advantage of the scenario where enforcement officials hesitate to stop them while patrolling the streets under fear that they may lose control resulting in accidents. Enforcement officials admitted that the lack of surveillance cameras at key spots along arterial roads in Ernakulam helped bikers go scot-free. Meanwhile, the MVD has directed its patrolling teams to be on the lookout for those resorting to bike racing and rash driving. The public can also alert enforcement officials about bikers involved in rash driving. They can click pictures of those violating traffic rules and send them to officials.  All enforcement squads have been alerted. We will not permit dangerous rides on high-end and modified bikes Joji P. Jose Regional Transport Officer, Ernakulam
Rahul’s decision a boost: Chandy|KOCHI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Senior Congress leader Oommen Chandy said here on Monday that Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s decision to contest the Lok Sabha election from Wayanad constituency would boost the poll prospects of the party in south India. “The Congress will win all the 20 Lok Sabha seats in Kerala with the decision of the Congress president to contest from Wayanad. It has enthused party workers in a big way,” he told mediapersons here. Mr. Chandy said Mr. Gandhi had a special affinity for Kerala. Asked whether he would retain Wayanad if he won both seats, the former Chief Minister said Mr. Gandhi would decide which seat should be retained. Mr. Chandy said the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee would decide on the constituencies where Mr. Gandhi would campaign in Kerala.

Tribespeople to boycott polls|PATHANAMTHITTA|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The tribespeople of Avanippara situated in the remote forest tracts of Konni have decided not to vote this time in protest against the “indifferent attitude of the government towards their pleas to address the water scarcity in the colony.” All the 33 families, with a total voter strength of 74, have decided to move into the forest interiors where they could get water from the shola forests and stay there till the onset of monsoon. The tribal settlement is situated right on the banks of Achencoil river. However, with the onset of summer, the river has almost dried up along Avanippara, leading to acute water scarcity in the locality. The tribespeople who eke out a living by procuring forest produce have been meeting their water needs by digging wells and ponds along the riverbanks for several decades. Their demand for a public well at the colony is yet to be addressed. Objections Similarly, the promises given to the tribespeople by successive governments to construct a bridge across the Achencoil river at Avanippara too remain unfulfilled reportedly owing to certain objections raised by the Forest Department. The polling booth at the Avanippara tribal settlement is the farthest and the last one in the Konni Assembly segment. The tribespeople say members of mainstream parties seldom visit the colony seeking votes.


Gap in autism diagnosis prevents early intervention|KOCHI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Autistic babies can be identified early by a trained person as the symptoms of avoiding eye contact and interaction will manifest in infants, say experts. According to P.N.N. Pisharody, paediatrician, smile and playful babbling will be missing in autistic babies. But these signals of autism are generally missed and the average age of diagnosis is about 6.5 years, when the child is in school. It is from here that parents learn about the child’s problems in interacting with others. Managing it then becomes a difficult task. If the child’s problem is identified by 2-3 years, most autistic children who come under the mild to moderate prevalence category could be trained to enter the mainstream school, says Dr. Pisharody. Apart from the District Early Intervention Centre at the General Hospital, there are only a few facilities available for early diagnosis. Delay in the social smile of the baby that is seen in 1-2 months is the first warning sign. However, it will take 18 months to have a proper diagnosis, says Aswin Kumar, Principal, Adarsh Charitable Trust, which runs a Risk Baby Unit in the city.

Parents of slain YC workers seek CBI probe|KOCHI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Expressing their lack of faith in the ongoing Crime Branch investigation into the twin murders at Kasaragod, the parents of the slain Youth Congress leaders Kripesh and Sarath Lal have approached the Kerala High Court seeking a probe by the CBI. Kripesh and Sarath Lal were hacked to death on February 17 at Periye in Kasaragod. The police had arrested a few CPI(M) leaders in connection with the murder. The present level of investigation, alleged the petitioners, was only “an eyewash and that too controlled by top leaders of the CPI(M), whose incriminatory conspiratorial role is very much evident and hence the police have not turned against those who are involved in the larger conspiracy behind the killings,” they said. The parents submitted that the ongoing investigation was “tainted with mala fide and a highly one-sided one.” Charge against CPI(M) They submitted that the present investigation team did not even take the initiative to summon the persons who made death threats against the Congress workers. The team succumbed to pressure from the CPI(M) leaders who were suspected to have conspired the twin murder, the parents submitted. The petitioners also submitted that they did not had any faith in the present investigation which was “partial, one-sided and defective as all the accused in the case belonged to the CPI(M), and the police machinery controlled by the party.”

18% surge in Corpn. revenue|THIRUVANANTHAPURAM|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The city Corporation has achieved a surge in tax collection in the 2018-19 financial year compared to the previous year, resulting in an 18% increase in its total revenues. The own fund collection, which was Rs. 80.03 crore in 2015-16 had touched Rs. 100 crore for the first time last year, with a total revenue of Rs. 102.55 crore. This year the revenue has further increased to Rs. 125.04 crore, making it the best record yet for the local body. Professional tax The professional tax collection increased by 22.4% from Rs. 40.68 crore last year to Rs. 52.42 crore in 2018-19. According to officials of the local body, the Corporation has in the past year taken several measures to increase professional tax collection. Firms in several sectors, including several companies in Technopark, have not been paying the taxes for many years. Demand notices were issued and reminders sent to make them pay up. The property tax increased by 15.5% from Rs. 54 crore last year to Rs. 64 crore in 2018-19. The Corporation had issued demand notices to several government buildings for which taxes have not been paid for the past many years. However, there are chances of a slight fall in this number next year as the Local Self Government department recently decided to make the revision of property tax retrospectively effective only from the year 2016 onwards, instead of the existing 2013. Since many have already remitted higher taxes as per the earlier order, the amount will have to be adjusted in the taxes for the subsequent years. Fee for adverts The biggest percentage-wise jump of 41.2% was in the advertisement licence fee, from Rs. 1.24 crore to Rs. 2.12 crore this year. The Dangerous and Offensive Trade license (D&O) fee increased by 34.7% from Rs. 1.32 crore to Rs. 2.02 crore. But rent collection from the buildings owned by the Corporation fell by 17.7% from Rs. 5.18 crore to Rs. 4.40 crore.

Parties tread the digital path to pitch promises|THIRUVANANTHAPURAM|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|“Would a 25-year-old prefer to read about promises of employment generation or the increase in old-age pensions,” asks an IT cell member of a political party. Targeted campaigning is the key in social media now, unlike in the early days when parties used to push out the same content for everyone. At the heart of it is the data analytics team, which studies voter behaviour based on data gathered from door-to-door surveys or through mobile applications. “The more you know of each voter personally, the more you can communicate to them effectively. This is where data analytics is important. Even if you don’t get such data on each voter, it is enough to get it for different segments, like first-time voters or women, and develop campaign messaging to target them. With Kerala having the highest smartphone penetration in India, digital campaigning is bound to create a bigger impact here,” says Anil K. Antony, convener of the State Congress digital media cell, who was part of the Congress’s IT cell operations for the Gujarat and Rajasthan Assembly elections. Platforms abound The ‘war rooms’ of the various parties resemble online news platforms with teams for research, content creation, production, and broadcasting. WhatsApp and Facebook continue to be the major platforms for online campaigning. While Twitter remained largely untapped, the parties have begun to reach out to the seemingly ‘apolitical’ youth by creating content for Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat. Instead of contracting the work out to agencies, the parties are now focussing on building a permanent in-house team, to cut costs. “Unlike other parties, we have had a social media team comprising only party workers from the initial days itself. Our focus is on delivering apt content to each WhatsApp group up to the booth level, with a target of hundreds of people in each booth. We have a fact-checking team to ensure that the content is factual and follows our political line,” says a member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist)’s IT cell. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which had sowed the seeds of its digital outreach strategy as early as 2010, hopes to reap the benefits of its full-fledged IT network. Right from its national cell down to constituency-level units, the BJP IT Vibhag has focussed on projecting the party’s policies through social media platforms. Besides, the Narendra Modi (NaMo) mobile application has been primed as a major campaign tool. Vibhag State convener Krishna Kumar says several volunteers have been assigned responsibilities to target social media users of various age groups and backgrounds. While the party has verified accounts in social networking platforms, it also feeds content to over 25,000 WhatsApp groups. No longer apolitical With the elections nearing, many apolitical WhatsApp groups and Facebook pages have metamorphosed into platforms for political propaganda. Analysts feel most parties have been cultivating such platforms for some time with an eye on reaping political gains. Though the Election Commission declared that internet platforms would come under the ambit of the model code of conduct, its enforcement remains a grey area. While paid content has to be screened, most parties prefer other means for campaign. Monitoring the source of unsolicited mass propaganda messages remains a daunting task for enforcement agencies.

Parents demand fee concessions|KANNUR|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Parents of students studying in the Pariyaram medical college here are more than happy that their children are now studying in the Kannur Government Medical College (KGMC) at Pariyaram as the government has promulgated an Ordinance turning the institution under the cooperative sector into a government college. The Kannur Government Medical College, which is the erstwhile Academy of Medical Sciences (ACME) and the Kerala State Co-operative Hospital and Centre for Advanced Medical Services (KSCHC & CAMS), popularly known as the Pariyaram medical college, came into being in the wake of the promulgation of the Ordinance last month, converting the institution under the cooperative sector into a government medical college. Benefits The parents, however, want the government to take steps to ensure that the students of the college be granted fee exemptions and other benefits they are entitled to as students of government institution. The first general body of the KGMC Parents Association held here the other day greeted the State government for taking over the PMC and converting it into KGMC. Govt. decision hailed A press release issued by the association on Monday said the general body unanimously aired the view that the Pinarayi Vijayan government had given to Kannur an all-time best gift by the takeover of the PMC, a long-standing dream of the people of Kannur. Exuding hope that the government decision would be an indirect and direct relief, the general body also demanded that the government initiate steps to extend fee exemptions and other benefits eligible to students of government medical colleges to those of the KGMC. The general body elected Narayana Prasad, S. Nazeeb and Gopinathan as president, secretary and treasurer respectively of the association. A 12-member executive committee was also formed.

Inclusiveness in focus on World Autism Day|Kozhikode|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|At Bevel Fest that will be held at Jubilee Hall in Thali on Tuesday, every one will get a chance to take selfies with several celebrities. The celebrities here are autistic children. The ‘Selfie with Celebrities’ programme is an attempt to encourage the differently abled to lead a normal life. “The best way to improve life skills of autistic children is to include them in day-to-day activities along with others,” said P. Sikander, Chairman of National Trust, the co-organiser of Bevel Fest. D Line School of Design is the other organiser of the event to be held on the occasion of World Autism Day. The attempt to ensure inclusiveness reflects on other programmes at the festival, the highlight being a painting competition in which anyone can participate irrespective of their physical or mental status. The competition, which starts at 11 a.m., has three categories — category 1 for students of the age group of 15 to 20; category 2 for the mentally-challenged and category 3 is for the physically-challenged. First-prize winners in each category will be awarded with 22 Carat D Line Gold medal. Another highlight of the festival will be the release of the SVEEP (Systematic Voters Education and Electoral Participation) bulletin for the differently abled.

Deshabhimani editorial’s Pappu remark creates furore|Thiruvananthapuram|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The CPI(M) found itself in a spot on Monday afterDeshabhimani, its mouthpiece in Kerala, referred to Congress president Rahul Gandhi as ‘Pappu’ in an editorial opposing his candidature from the Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency. Top CPI(M) leaders, including Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac, scrambled to make amends for the faux pas stating that the graceless remark did not reflect party policy. P.M. Manoj, the resident editor, regretted the ‘error’ in an FB post. He saidDeshabhimanidid not endorse personalised attacks. The editorial, which derides Mr. Gandhi for contesting in Wayanad out of fear that the BJP might defeat him in his pocketborough in Amethi, appeared under the headline ‘Pappu Strike Will Complete Congress Rout’ on April 1. The headline became the centre of a political storm with Congress leaders pointing out that the CPI(M) had tactlessly regurgitated a derogatory term publicised by the Sangh Parivar to scoff at Mr. Gandhi.  It soon became a habit for BJP leaders to take a dig at the Congress by referring to Mr. Gandhi as Pappu. Their references to Mr. Gandhi as Pappu increased after he became the party president, marking a generational shift in the Congress in 2017. V.T. Balaram, Congress MLA from Thrithala, said the derogatory reference to Mr. Gandhi smacked of the moral and intellectual pauperdom inherent in the CPI(M). The editorial, among other things, accused Mr. Gandhi of capitulating to the Indian Union Muslim League that has considerable influence in Wayanad constituency owing to the large percentage of Muslim voters. It also attacked Mr. Gandhi for projecting a soft-Hindutva persona with his temple visits and repeated hints from Congress leaders that he was Brahmin who sported a sacred thread.

In a counter-affidavit, Renu Raj, the Subcollector, stated that seven others too had approached the High Court with similar petitions. The attempt of the petitioners was to grab government land at Chinnakanal under the guise of land assignment applications. Applicants’ version Though the applicants contended that they were in possession of the property and they were cultivating acacia, coffee and eucalyptus on the holding, none of the petitioners were occupying the holding and carrying out any cultivation on the land, the Subcollector submitted. By one person The claims were not maintainable as the property claimed by them was a government holding. On verification, it was found that all the applications were prepared by one person and the handwriting in all of them was similar, she submitted. The petitioners neither had title deeds nor were in possession or occupation of the said land. Not residents The petitioners were also not residing in Idukki district. As per the basic Tax Register, the holdings, which the petitioners wanted to be assigned in their name, was recorded as purambok, and was not assignable, she said.

CPI(M), BJP speaking in one voice, says Chennithala|KASARAGOD|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are now speaking in one voice after Congress president Rahul Gandhi decided to contest from Wayanad, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala has said. Talking to reporters at Kanhangad here on Monday, Mr. Chennithala said CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury’s observation that Mr. Gandhi’s candidature in Wayanad was sending a wrong message sounded strange. CPI candidate Mr. Yechury should take the initiative to withdraw the Communist Party of India candidate in Wayanad if he feared that a wrong message was going out. The Sangh Parivar’s narrative that Mr. Gandhi’s had fled from Amethi was now being taken by the CPI(M) in the State, he said adding the CPI(M) was hiding the fact that the BJP was the rival of Mr. Gandhi there. Recalling Mr. Yechury’s proposal in the last CPI(M) Party Congress for a secular alternative at the Centre and the party’s West Bengal unit’s proposal for a electoral alliance with the Congress, Mr. Chennithala said the CPI(M) leadership in Kerala which had ‘scuttled’ the proposals then was now vocal about a secular alternative. The Congress had no understanding with the CPI(M) in the LS election, he said, adding in the contemporary politics in the country, the Left front had no relevance.

A commendable feat in AMRUT|THIRUVANANTHAPURAM|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The city Corporation has come second in the implementation of projects under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) scheme, on a list of nine local bodies in the State. The local body has been leading with maximum implementation till early this year. However, the Guruvayur municipality, a smaller local body, has gone ahead of it, while all other major municipal Corporations are trailing far behind. 23% expenditure The local body has completed works to the tune of Rs. 81.68 crore till now, out of the Rs. 355.15 crore for which administrative sanction has been obtained, with an expenditure of 23%. Guruvayur, though leading, has completed projects to the tune of only Rs. 61.59 crore, out of the Rs. 203.10 crore for which administrative sanction has been accorded. The Kochi Corporation is in third place with an expenditure of Rs. 55.35 crore. Main areas The Thiruvananthapuram Corporation made the most progress in water supply, sewerage and storm water drainage projects. As much as 38% of the water supply projects have been completed. In the past one year, the local body has also completed storm water drainages in various parts of the city. Out of the 110 storm water projects, 45 have already been completed. In the urban transport sector, the work on three multi-level parking lots are expected to be completed by August. The tenders for the plan to develop a park in the Station Kadavu-Pound Kadavu area were opened on Monday. Five companies have responded. According to a Corporation official, this will be sent to the Chief Engineer of the Local Self Government Department for clearance, after which the financial bids will be opened. KWA projects Out of the total of Rs. 81.68 crore spent, Rs. 62.65 crore was spent on projects executed by the Kerala Water Authority (KWA), while Rs. 19.03 crore was spent on non-KWA projects. The work on a 75-mld water treatment plant at Aruvikkara, which began six months ago, is expected to be completed later this year. The commissioning of this plant will increase the per capita supply of water to the city. One of the major projects under the AMRUT scheme, the sewerage network project covering the Kazhakuttam-Technopark-Medical College area, is aimed at drastically improving the sewerage network coverage in the city. But it has not made much progress due to various issues, from reluctance of contractors to issues regarding road cutting.

Tension as students seek postponement of exams|THIRUVANANTHAPURAM|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Tension prevailed on the University of Kerala premises at Palayam on Monday when an agitation by students under the aegis of the Students Federation of India (SFI) turned unruly. The protesters laid siege to the administrative block and demanded postponement of the sixth-semester B.Com. examinations scheduled on April 4 and 6. Police deployed A large posse of police was deployed on the premises to bring the situation under control. The police prevented a few students who attempted to barge into the building.

CPI(M), Congress in pitched battle|Kozhikode|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|What happens when popular two-time CPI(M) legislator A. Pradeep Kumar takes on popular Congress MP, M.K. Raghavan, who is aiming a hat-trick? In the current state of play in Kozhikode, it is too close a call to predict a winner. However, the UDF can take comfort in Congress president Rahul Gandhi entering the fray in neighbouring Wayanad. His entry appears to have made it hard for the LDF which was hoping for an easy victory. So Left strategists have been forced to devise new tactics even as the Loktantrik Janata Dal and Indian National League are solidly behind Mr. Pradeep Kumar. A surprise Unlike other Congress nominees, Mr. Raghavan, who was certain of his candidature, began electioneering even before his name was officially declared by the party. At the same time, the CPI(M) leadership threw a surprise by fielding Mr. Pradeep Kumar. With the ruling party’s well-oiled political machinery, Mr. Pradeep Kumar has gained an upper hand in the first round of campaign. No Sabarimala card Though the CPI(M) set the agenda of the contest on political lines, the campaigns hinge on development issues. However, the main candidates are eschewing the Sabarimala issue. CPI(M) campaign managers, while questioning Mr. Raghavan’s development initiatives which have benefited the middle class and the poor in the last 10 years, are going to town with the achievements of Mr. Pradeep Kumar in the Kozhikode North Assembly segment. LDF dominance The religious landscape, especially the upper caste Hindu and Muslim votes, too will impact the polls. The LDF won Balussery, Elathur, Kozhikode North, Beypore, Kunnamangalam and Koduvally out of the seven Assembly seats in the 2016 elections securing a total lead of 90, 000 votes. The only segment with the UDF is Kozhikode South. This political edge was also seen in earlier Assembly polls. But it plummets when it comes to the Lok Sabha election as demonstrated by the UDF in the 2009 and 2014 polls. From a slim margin of 838 votes in 2009, Mr. Raghavan carved out a niche for himself in Kozhikode to secure a lead of 16,883 votes in 2014. BJP representative The BJP has fielded K.P. Prakash Babu, who is also the State president of its youth wing, Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha. He was in the news recently in connection with Sabarimala protests. Last time the BJP secured over 1.15 lakh votes. Kozhikode has a total electorate of 12,64,844 including 6,51, 560 women, 6, 13,276 men and eight transgenders.


Monitoring cells to check atrocities against children|THIRUVANANTHAPURAM|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Alarmed by the recent spate of atrocities against children, the Kerala State Council for Child Welfare has decided to launch monitoring and protection cells to keep tabs on such incidents and ensure protection for children who are treated inhumanely. Council general secretary S.P. Deepak said that the council had been receiving numerous complaints on children being subjected to exploitation. The brutal torture of a seven-year-old child at the hands of his mother’s partner could not be viewed as an isolated incident. Many such shocking brutalities occurred in broken families and when one of the parents chose to live with another partner. Studies conducted by the council showed that besides girls, boys aged below 15 years also were subjected to exploitation. The monitoring cells to be launched in each district would comprise members of the district council for child welfare and the district coordinator of the Thanal shelter home for children. They would be assisted by officials, including the District Collector, District Police Chief, District Child Welfare Committee and the child protection officer, Mr. Deepak said. The council urged the public to register complaints and provide information regarding exploitation of children at the toll-free number 1517.

SCS: Modugula dares Galla to open debate|GUNTUR|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Modugula Venugopala Reddy, MLA of Guntur West, who has been fielded by the YSRCP to take on Galla Jayadev of the TDP in the Guntur Lok Sabha constituency, has challenged the latter for an open debate on the efforts of both TDP and YSRCP to achieve Special Category Status to Andhra Pradesh. “I am ready for an open debate with Mr. Jayadev on any issue, including the SCS. I had been manhandled and abused by Congress leaders in the Lok Sabha during the discussion on bifurcation of the State, when Mr. Jayadev was still in the Congress, yet no one organised processions then, but when Mr. Jayadev uttered “Mr. Prime Minister.. in the Lok Sabha,” he was welcomed with a huge procession. I was just surprised. Don’t I deserve recognition in the party I had worked during the last ten years? Now, I and my party (YSRCP) is determined to get SCS and we will do whatever both inside and outside Parliament to achieve it,” said Mr. Reddy during a media conference. ‘Ill-treatment’ Launching a no-holds-barred attack on the TDP, Mr. Reddy said that he had been treated like a secondary citizen in the party which he had served with utmost dedication as an MP of Narsaraopet and later as an MLA of Guntur West.  Reminiscing of his days he had spent in the town, Mr. Reddy said that his father, M. Papi Reddy had been a socialist leader, who was imprisoned during emergency. “I was not an opportunistic politician like Mr. Jayadev and it was only after realising that the SCS is possible only with the YSRCP, I changed my loyalities,” said Mr. Reddy.

Fund crunch disrupts students’ scholarship|Thiruvananthapuram|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Students belonging to economically weaker sections among forward communities will not get their merit scholarship for 2018-19 owing to financial crunch. The scheme, implemented by the Kerala State Welfare Corporation for Forward Communities, ran into trouble earlier in the year when the government imposed a 20% Plan cut. The State government had given administrative sanction to the corporation to launch seven merit scholarship during 2018-19 worth Rs. 13.60 crore for students of the economically weaker sections among the forward communities studying in higher secondary and other higher education courses. The total number of beneficiaries came to over 50,000. According to government sources, over 20,000 students belonging to the higher secondary scheme were excluded from the scholarship owing to fund shortage. The State government initially rejected the demand for release of the Rs. 13.60 crore, but after intense lobbying by the corporation, agreed to release Rs. 5 crore. But even the Rs. 5 crore sanctioned by the government failed to get clearance of the Ways and Means section. Since the new financial year began on Monday, the State government could either shoot down the corporation’s schemes or earmark funds for paying the 2018-19 merit scholarship from the budget allocation for 2019-20. Sources said that the delay in payment of scholarship would defeat its very purpose.  The scheme has been implemented by the Kerala State Welfare Corporation for Forward Communities

A cafe that will serve science hot|KALPETTA|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Science is often seen as boring, difficult and mathematical for many, but a group of science experts of the Hume Centre for Ecology and Wildlife Biology here are gearing up to launch ‘Café Scientifique’ to promote science among public in an interesting way. Café Scientifique, the first such initiative in the State, envisages to bring science back into popular culture by demystifying scientific research for the public and empowering non-scientists to comfortably assess science and technology issues, particularly those that impact social policy making, says C.K. Vishnudas, an ornithologist and director of the centre. Science initiative Café Scientifique is a grassroots public science initiative based on the French Café Philosophique model. Originating in England, the concept quickly gained popularity and was adopted by other countries. Similar but independent events have also sprung up in many cities using variations of the ‘Café Scientifique’ or ‘Science Café’ monikers, Mr. Vishnudas says. ‘We are planning to organise meetings of science enthusiasts in the district every month at a café or a convenient place, where one or more scientists are invited to talk to the public about new developments in science,” he said. The project is also aimed at making science relevant, powerful and important to the public, especially the younger generations. Various topics such as universe, climate change, evolution, genetics and human-animal relations will be discussed in every monthly gathering. The first session in the series will be inaugurated by C. Balagopal , a starter mentor and a writer, with a special talk on “Science and Society” at the Cosmopolitan club auditorium here at 4.30 p.m. on Wednesday. C. Sasikumar, an ornithologist and writer, will deliver the keynote address.

To establish four camps and climb, it takes approximately 45 to 50 days. Hot to cold Most of them will travel from high temperatures in plain lands to freezing temperatures which drop down to as low as minus 30 degrees C at Everest summit. “To acclimatise them to high altitude, cold temperatures and to the routes, the climbers will reach camp 1 and camp 2 which are at 7,500-metre altitude and return to the base camp. Thereafter, depending on weather and physical condition, we will head directly to the summit. Oxygen cylinders will be used to support breathing,” Mr. Shekhar Babu said. Route hazards Explaining the difference between North Col and South Col routes, he said, “The North side is technically difficult as compared to South Col, but chances of natural hazards are less. But one has to be technically and physically commanding. Malavath Poorna, the youngest girl to reach the summit, took that route in 2014, he added. Apart from four climbers from Telangana, the team includes eleven people from Maharashtra Tribal Development Department, and Nahida Manzoor from Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir. Five women are also part of the team. The cost for the expedition works out to around Rs. 29 lakh per person. Climbers either spend the money from their pockets or rely on donors.  To acclimatise them, the climbers will reach the camps at 7,500-metre altitude and return to the base camp. Depending on weather and physical condition, we will head directly to the summit.

Modi targeting Heritage out of jealousy: CM|CHITTOOR|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu on Monday alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was jealous of the growth of Heritage Foods administered by his spouse Bhuvaneswari, and hence making unwarranted comments against his family. Addressing a public meeting at Bangarupalem of the Puthalapattu Assembly constitueny, Mr. Naidu said Heritage was the result of his wife’s 27 years of struggle. “Even Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy made allegations against Heritage and initiated 26 inquires against me, but nothing came out of them. Now, Mr. Modi at his Kurnool and Rajahmundry meetings targeted Lokesh. He has no family and no ‘sabhyata’(culture). He forgot the dignity of the Prime Minister’s post. He has become protector of criminals,” he added. . He termed PM’s remarks on Polavaram “lies.” The Centre did not give any money for the project. “By July, lift works will be over, and by year-end, the project will be completed,” Mr. Naidu said. He observed that Mr. Modi, Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, and YSRCP president Jagan Mohan Reddy did not want the project to be completed. Calling Mr. Modi “AP drohi,” Mr. Naidu asked the PM to step into the State only after fulfilling the promises. Dig at Pawan Mr. Naidu said that while he was making tireless efforts to uplift all sections of people, “Mr. Modi, KCR and Mr. Jagan are out to undo it with false propaganda.” Interestingly, Mr. Naidu took a dig at JSP chief Pawan Kalyan, referring to his popular hit “Atharintiki Daredi.”

Jagan hand in glove with Modi, KCR, alleges Rayapati|GUNTUR|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Member of Parliament, Narsaraopet, Rayapati Sambasiva Rao has said that Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy is hand in glove with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Telangana CM K. Chandrasekhar Rao, and is bent on stalling the development of the State. Addressing a series of roadshows during his campaign at Vinukonda, Mr. Sambasiva Rao said the recent utterances of Jagan praising Modi and KCR spoke of his nature to ally with those who did not want A.P. to develop. “Jagan says Kia Motors is a reality due to efforts of Modi, while it was Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu who got the company to set up their plant at Anantapur. Andhra Pradesh even got an award for being the topper in ease of doing business,’’ he said. Further, Mr. Modi stopped giving funds for Polavaram project and capital Amaravati, he alleged. Doling out several promises to end drinking water crisis in Palnadu, Mr. Sambasiva Rao said three water grids would be set up at Vinukonda, Macherla and Gurazala at a cost of Rs. 600 crore and Varekipudisila project phase-1would be grounded at a cost of Rs. 340 crore at Veldurthy mandal. He promised a market yard in Durgi and release of funds to Vinukonda from the Asian Development Bank. CSR funds Several development works had been taken up with CSR (corporate social responsibility) funding which include setting up of a power grid at a cost of Rs. 2.20 crore at Vinukonda and four water plants at Bollapalli mandal with the help of grants from the ONGC. Electrification of Guntur-Guntakal railway doubling works had also been taken up while Nadikudi-Srikalahasti railway line works were being completed, he said. The Narsaraopet MP also promised to set up a new industrial park at Vinukonda and a horticultural university at Macherla.

Tribal steps on landmine in forest, killed|MULUGU DISTRICT|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|A tribal man was killed in the deep forest when he accidentally stepped on a landmine near Nuguru village in Venkatapuram mandal in wee hours here on Monday. According to the information reaching here, four tribals belonging to Mukunurupalem went inside the forest to collect bamboo. One of them, Soyam Pentaiah (43) was killed instantly after he accidentally stepped on a landmine. His associates – Rama Rao, Laxmaiah and Dulaiah — got fear-stricken and ran away and informed the Venkatapuram police. The police suspect that the landmine might have been planted by naxalites targeting the security forces combing the forest area. The CRPF and special battalion forces are deployed all over the district in view of the ensuing Parliament elections on April 11. The Maoist party naxals were trying to gain upper hand by targeting them. The Maoist party had released banners and posters furtively on the outskirts of villages in Wazed and Venkatapuram mandals last week urging people to boycott the Parliament elections. According to sources, the Chhattisgarh police recently arrested three persons from Chelpaka village in Eturunagaram mandal suspecting their role in recent attacks on security forces and reportedly recovered weapons from them. Following Maoist armed squad movements between Bhupalpally and Eturunagaram mandals and Chhattisgarh forest area, the government deployed armed police in large numbers. Presently, the ferry points and irrigation projects on river Godavari are being manned by the central paramilitary forces.

SNC Lavalin case to be heard only after polls|NEW DELHI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|A month ago, the Supreme Court accused the CBI of “dragging on” the appeals against the discharge of Kerala Chief Minister in the SNC-Lavalin corruption case. On Monday, the court itself decided to adjourn the case until after the summer vacation and the Lok Sabha election during April-May. This time, the CBI said it was “ready” to argue its case, but a Bench, led by Justice N.V. Ramana, decided to defer the case, saying hearing it would take time. At the previous hearing on February 22, the Bench expressed its displeasure when Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta, for the CBI, sought an adjournment. He had asked the court to list the case on a non-miscellaneous day when fresh cases would not be heard. The case was finally posted for the first week of April, days before the first phase of the general election beginning on April 11. The appeals have run into continuous adjournments in the past several months. In its appeal, the CBI has contended that Pinarayi Vijayan should face trial. The investigation agency said Mr. Vijayan had travelled to Canada as a “guest” of Lavalin in 1997, when he was the State’s Power Minister. ‘Crucial decision’ It was there that he had made the “crucial” decision to promote Lavalin, a consultancy firm retained on a fixed-rate basis, from consultants to suppliers. The corruption case concerns the loss of Rs. 86.25 crore in the Kerala State Electricity Board’s contract with Lavalin for the renovation and modernisation of the Pallivasai, Sengulam and Panniar hydroelectric projects in Idukki district. The CBI said the Kerala High Court’s decision to discharge the Chief Minister was “not correct.” On August 23 last year, the High Court discharged Mr. Vijayan and former KSEB officers K. Mohanachandran and A. Francis. Mr. Mohanachandran is a former Principal Secretary, Department of Power, and Mr. Francis was the Joint Secretary. However, the three other accused — M. Kasthuriranga Iyer, G. Rajasekharan Nair and R. Sivadasan — were asked to stand trial. Mr. Nair was then Member (Accounts) of the KSEB, and Mr. Iyer was Chief Engineer (Generation). The accused who were ordered to stand trial have also appealed to the Supreme Court for parity of treatment. Their appeals was also listed on Friday along with the CBI’s appeal. They have argued thatif Mr. Vijayan could be discharged, they should also be freed of charges.

BJP has few known faces in fray for LS polls|Staff Reporter Vijayawada|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The BJP, which aims at emerging as a viable alternative to the TDP and the YSRC, has only a handful candidates familiar to the electorate in the Lok Sabha (LS) and the Assembly constituencies. Of the 25 LS constituencies, only three have prominent faces. They are State president Kanna Lakshminarayana who is taking on his old foe Rayapati Sambasiva Rao and TDP’s Lavu Sri Krishna Devarayalu in Narsaraopet and Daggubati Purandeswari locking horns with veteran TDP leader late M.V.V.S. Murthy’s grandson Bharat, Jana Sena Party (JSP)’s V.V. Lakshminarayana (former CBI Joint Director) and YSRCP’s M.V.V. Satyanarayana. Both Mr. Lakshminarayana and Ms. Purandeswari had long stints in the Congress with the latter working as a Union Minister twice. The third prominent LS candidate is Pydikondala Manikyala Rao who was the MLA from Tadepalligudem. He is contesting from Narsapuram in the place of sitting MP Gokaraju Gangaraju. On the Assembly front, P. Vishnu Kumar Raju stands out as its face being the floor leader in the Assembly representing the Visakhapatnam north. He is taking on Minister Ganta Srinivasa Rao and YSRCP’s K.K. Raju. Mr. Raju is the only one of the four BJP MLAs who continued as MLAs till the House was prorogued (former Ministers Kamineni Srinivas, Manikyala Rao and Akula Satyanarayana resigned). Pulusu Janardhan, former mayor (Congress) of Visakhapatnam, is contesting from Gajuwaka against JSP president Pawan Kalyan, sitting TDP MLA Palla Srinivasa Rao and YSRCP’s Tippala Nagi Reddy.

Naidu promises bright future for Pulivendula|PULIVENDULA (Kadapa district)|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Appearing upbeat during his roadshow in the district on Monday, Chief Minister and TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu vowed to wrest all the Assembly seats in Kadapa district, which he claimed were once the party’s strongholds. Even as he toured Jammalamadugu and Pulivendula, considered the citadel of the YS family, Mr. Naidu appeared thoroughly encouraged by the huge crowd that greeted him. At Pulivendula, he promised to transform the orchard-rich constituency into a horticulture hub and also as ‘No.1 constituency’ in the State. Recalling his painstaking efforts behind pumping in Rs. 1,200 crore to bring irrigation water to the constituency, Mr. Naidu offered to build cold storage facility and take Pulivendula fruits to the global market to bring higher revenue to the producers. He accused YS family of extracting money illegally from the sweet lime, orange and plantain growers to the tune of 20% of their yield. “I will liberate you from this ‘Jaganmohan Reddy Tax’, which is a new form of GST,” he said. He sought the people’s support for his candidate S.V. Satish Kumar Reddy. “You have voted for that family to power for 40 years. Now give Mr. Satish a chance,” he said.  Steel plant Earlier at Jammalamadugu, he pointed to the determination behind laying the foundation stone for the steel slant, despite the Centre’s ‘non-cooperation,’ and promised to build the plant on coming to power. He appealed to people not to give credence the YSR Congress Party’s campaign that the government was planning to close down the Rayalaseema Thermal Power Plant (RTPP) in Muddanur. Mr. Naidu recalled he had brought water through canals to areas hitherto uncovered in the last five years. He said the warring factions led by P. Ramasubba Reddy and Adinarayana Reddy had buried the hatchet, which would augur well for the district, and sought the people’s support to the two contesting as Jammalamadugu MLA and Kadapa MP candidates respectively.

‘Pasupu Kumkuma’ a ploy to garner votes, says Vijayamma|SRIKAKULAM|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Alleging that the TDP government does not have commitment to address the problems of people, YSR Congress Party leader Y.S. Vijayamma has said that Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu has introduced the ‘Pasupu-Kumkuma’ scheme only to garner support from the women voters. Addressing a public meeting at Patapatnam on Monday, Ms. Vijayamma urged the voters ‘not to fall prey’ to the schemes introduced by the TDP government, terming the programmes as ‘a ploy to gain political mileage’. “Programmes such as ‘Pasupu Kumkuma’ will be scrapped after the elections,” she claimed. Referring to the Chief Ministerial tenure of her husband Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, Ms. Vijayamma said the YSR government had provided loans at lower interest rate and introduced many welfare schemes for the poor. She urged people to vote for party candidates Duvvada Srinivas and Reddi Shanti.

Navayuga terminal reaches milestone|Staff Reporter Vijayawada|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Navayuga Container Terminal (NCT) reached an important milestone last week by handling 500,000 TEUs for the first time in a financial year (2018-19).

Elderly people happy with pension scheme: Kala|SRIKAKULAM|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Minister for Energy and Telugu Desam Party State president Kala Venkata Rao said there was an overwhelming response from elderly people for the welfare schemes, especially the pension scheme, being effectively implemented by the government. He said the then YSR government used to pay only Rs. 200 pension but it was enhanced to Rs. 2,000 by the Chandrababu Naidu administration.

Mr.Venkata Rao, who is contesting in Etcherla constituency, hoped that the welfare schemes and development would ensure massive victory for the Telugu Desam Party candidates in all 10 Assembly seats of Srikakualm district.

Thushar to contest against Rahul|THIRUVANANTHAPURAM|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The dramatic entry of Congress president Rahul Gandhi into the Wayanad Lok Sabha segment and the National Democratic Alliance decision to field Bharath Dharma Jana Sena (BDJS) president Thushar Vellappally against him have propelled the fledgling party into national politics and enhanced its scope for bargaining within the alliance. BJP president Amit Shah announced Thushar as the NDA nominee on Monday. “I proudly announce Shri Thushar Vellappally, President of Bharat Dharma Jana Sena as NDA candidate from Wayanad,” Mr. Shah tweeted. Though the BJP national leadership offered Thrissur, listed as one of the probable segments where the party could register an impressive performance to Thushar, he initially shied away from joining the race citing various reasons. The main reason was reported to be the grouse the BDJS nursed against the BJP leadership for failing to honour the commitments made to it while joining the alliance. BJP president Amit Shah had to virtually coax Thushar to take up the candidature since he felt it was quite decisive to cast an impression that the NDA State unit was still intact and it was embarking on a serious contest in the State. The move was also aimed at perplexing the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP) Yogam leadership that had lent support to the Left Democratic Front’s initiatives for conserving renaissance values post-Sabarimala agitation led by the Sangh Parivar. Concrete assurance Thushar is reported to have wrested concrete assurances from the BJP leadership before taking the plunge and when it sounded out the need to relinquish the seat and shift to Wayanad in the wake of Mr. Gandhi’s entry he conceded without any dissent. The fight against Mr. Gandhi will afford the BDJS the space within the NDA to strike a better bargain and become the pivot of the discussions in national politics. Though the BJP had made a series of commitments to the BDJS when it was inducted into the NDA State unit, none of them was honoured and their relations had strained before the Chengannur Assembly byelection. The decision to shift Thushar to Wayanad would give an opportunity for the BJP to have one of its prominent leaders to contest from Thrissur, sources said.

20 held in Kerala anti-child porn op|Thiruvananthapuram|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|A covert cyber surveillance and infiltration operation initiated by the Kerala Police with the help of the Interpol in January to crack down on child pornography culminated on Monday with the arrest of 20 persons from different parts of the State. Additional Director General of Police, South-Zone, Manoj Abraham, who heads the anti-Child Sexual Exploitation Unit (CSE), toldThe Hinduthat the police had registered 25 cases in connection with the arrests that unfolded across Kerala early Sunday. The investigators used a special software provided by the Interpol, Argos, to launch the secret operation code-named P-Hunt. Police investigators and resource persons drawn from Kerala’s vast pool of IT experts hunched for nearly three months at the Cyberdome facility at the Technopark here to identify persons who obsessively uploaded, swapped and traded child sexual abuse content on instant messaging platforms, restricted chat rooms and Internet websites. Argos, named after the mythical all-seeing guardian of gods of the Greek Pantheon, helped the police scour encrypted messaging groups created to furtively swap child porn, comb through the hidden matrix of the Darknet, and eavesdrop on secret chatrooms. It helped the law enforcers track the uploading and dissemination of locally generated child abuse content and finally identify the predators individually by zeroing in on their IP addresses. A Cyberdome investigator said Argos identified child porn images and videos on the web, pinned down their unique digital signature and flagged the prurient images to track their circulation on a cross-section of Internet-linked communication platforms. It also helped the police prevent the recirculation of the photos once they were identified and tagged by investigators. Home-created images Mr Abraham said the increasing prevalence of ‘home-created’ pornographic images, possibly generated by the predators themselves, was worrying. Most of the images traded on porn sites were candid snaps of children from water theme parks, schools, beaches, homes and resorts. Another officer said that Argos had its limitations. For its instance, it could not track peer-to-peer sharing of child porn. Child predators were using encryption and data concealing software to shield themselves from the eyes of the law.

Chevireddy, Nani vie for Chandragiri ‘fort’|Tirupati|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Chandragiri Assembly constituency in Chittoor district hit the headlines even before the poll bugle was blown. But, for all the wrong reasons. It was this ‘fort’ constituency that blew the lid off the issue pertaining to the alleged removal of names from the electoral roll through anonymous submission of Form 7 online. Blame it on the delimitation process undertaken ahead of the 2009 polls, this ‘peculiarly-carved’ constituency spreading from the south-western edge of the Tirupati city up to the Talakona forest is not only a heady mix of urban, rural, forest and hilly landscapes, but also quite unwieldy for one to travel.In 2014 elections, incumbent MLA Chevireddy Bhaskar Reddy (YSR Congress Party) became the first non-Kamma candidate to register a win from the native constituency of Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu by defeating his TDP rival Galla Aruna Kumari, who had then migrated from the Congress. This means Mr. Chevireddy Bhaskar Reddy enjoyed a tacit support of the community in 2014. Caste equation However, poll pundits say that the divided community appears to have united now and is hell-bent on wresting Chandragiri. IT Minister N. Lokesh himself has reportedly got down to the business and chosen TDP district president Pulivarthi Venkata Mani Prasad (Nani) as the candidate from this segment. With the party elevating Ms. Aruna Kumari as a politburo member and retaining her in Amaravati for ‘strategic reasons’, she has to support the party candidate here. However, Mr. Bhaskar Reddy is considered a ‘man of the masses’ for he is said to be wielding enough influence over the youth. Accusing the TDP government of meting out a step-motherly treatment to this segment, he widely toured the villages, attended to people’s problems and infused funds for development. Sources say that he was not worried about getting re-elected, until the TDP revealed its trump card Nani, a widely-accepted face who is said to have brought the dissenting groups together. Sources say Mr. Bhaskar Reddy has become the butt of criticism among womenfolk for obstructing the ‘Pasupu Kumkuma’ programme, which Mr. Nani apparently worked out to his favour cleverly. High-stakes In the wake of allegations over online deletion of voters, this constituency has witnessed an ugly turn of events such as arrest of party workers, pitting similar-sounding names in the fray, threatening Independent candidates, slapping kidnap cases, party workers roaming in the guise of psephologists, physical assault on workers and etc, though canvassing in the rest of the Chittoor district remained peaceful. Voters say that distribution of goodies and freebies started six months before the elections, understandably by both the sides.

AgriGold vice-chairman dies in Secunderabad|VIJAYAWADA|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|AgriGold Group of Companies vice-chairman Immadi Sadasiva Varaprasad (70) reportedly died of cardiac arrest in Secunderabad on Monday.

‘Decentralisation key to Chittoor growth’|TIRUPATI|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Speakers at Chittoor district’s 109th formation day, observed here on Monday, called decentralisation and fast-tracking of pending projects as the key to ensuring the district’s development. At the annual event conducted by the Academy of Grassroots Studies and Research of India (AGRASRI), Centre for Rayalaseema Studies president Bhuman called for bifurcation of Chittoor by carving out a new district with Tirupati as headquarters, in order to ensure equitable distribution of resources and development of backward areas like Madanapalle, Punganur, Nagari and Satyavedu. “Tirupati is currently overburdened and concentration of all new facilities in and around Tirupati is not advisable,” he observed. Chittoor is the size of combined Srikakulam and Vizianagaram and needs to be divided, Mr. Bhuman said, recalling the three-decade-old demand. Awardees  Former High Court judge Justice D. Subramanyam presented special awards to achievers hailing from the soil viz., G.V. Srinath Reddy (Visishta Ratna), Bhuman (Special Jury), SV Veterinary University Vice-Chancellor Y.

A cakewalk for sitting MLA Gadde?|VIJAYAWADA|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Election in the Vijayawada East constituency this season appears to be a cakewalk for the incumbent MLA and Telugu Desam Party candidate Gadde Rama Mohan aka Rammohan. But due to various factors and mixed composition of the electors with different social and economic backgrounds, the opponents are hoping to give a tough competition. While Mr. Rama Mohan is a two-time MLA and one-time MP (Vijayawada), his opponents from the two other major parties — YSR Congress and Jana Sena — are novices. Boppana Bhava Kumar of the YSRCP, who is the corporator of the 3rd division in the East Constituency, is contesting for the first time as MLA. Significantly, the party chose Mr. Bhava Kumar over senior leader and former MLA Yalamanchili Ravi who won the election on Praja Rajyam Party ticket against Mr. Rama Mohan with a slight majority. The JSP, has fielded a new face —Batthina Rama Mohan —who is into transport business. Radha factor In what is an added advantage to Mr. Rama Mohan, two of his main opponents from the YSRCP and the Congress in the 2014 election are on his side this election. One of them, Vangaveeti Radhakrishna, who contested on YSRCP ticket and lost to Mr. Rama Mohan was even campaigning for the latter as the party’s star campaigner. The other opponent — Devineni Rajasekhar aka Nehru’s son Devineni Avinash — too joined the TDP and is contesting from Gudivada. Though he has not taken part in campaign so far, his aunt Devineni Aparna, a TDP corporator, is vigorously campaigning for Mr. Rama Mohan. Mr. Rama Mohan, who has contested six times so far, won from Gannavaram in 1994 against the Telugu Desam Party. The political scenario in the constituency has changed in favour of the TDP in the last two years. Two of the corporators representing hill-slope and slum areas in Gunadala and Krishnalanka respectively that were considered important for the YSRCP joined the TDP. In addition, with Mr. Radhakrishna joining TDP, another corporator of the YSRCP also joined the ruling party and the YSRCP has only two corporators out of six divisions in the Krishnalanka area. In all, at least 11 of the total 16 corporators in the constituency are campaigning for the TDP. Mr. Boppana has been campaigning in the constituency along with YSRCP MP candidate Potluri Vara Prasad. Though Mr. Rama Mohan of the JSP is a new face, he expects to gain traction with the following Pawan Kalyan has among the masses and the members of Kapu community who have a large vote share in Krishnalanka and other areas. The constituency has city’s posh colonies located around Benz Circle and also densely populated slum and hill-slope areas. A large number of beneficiaries living on the hill-slopes have been demanding houses from the government and not many have been sanctioned. On the other hand, voters in the constituency have many reasons not to vote for the ruling party. Many development projects are yet to be completed and people are being subjected to inconvenience. Apart from the major project Benz Circle flyover, stormwater drain project, road constructions and others are still going on at a snail’s pace. “We have been apologising for the delay in construction of Christurajpuram road. People have understood the reasons behind the delay and they are also aware that it will be completed soon,” Mr. Rama Mohan said.

Parents continue protest against school fee hike|VISAKHAPATNAM|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Parents of children studying in Timpany School protested on Monday against the school management for hiking fee by 30 to 40%. Over 10 parents launched an indefinite hunger strike demanding that the management roll back the decision. It may be recalled that a few days back, the parents staged protest against the management of the school for forcing them to buy books, stationery, uniform and shoes from the school premises at high prices. Parents were unhappy since there had been no consent of Parents-Teacher’s Association before implementing the hike. Though the management assured that they would roll back the increased fee by Friday, the management ignored their promise, says one of the parents Manmohan Pasari. Appealing the District Collector, the parents requested him to address the issue and also control the management. The parents also requested the Board of Education to take action against the school management for fleecing the parents. “We will continue our hunger strike until the management rolled back its decision,” Ms. Renuka a parent said. Meanwhile, the management of Timpany Schools has condemned the agitation by a ‘small group of parents’ against the hike in fee and alleged that it was a bid by the group to tarnish the image of the school. The management noted in a statement that an advance notice for fee hike was issued to the parents in December 2018. However, in a face-to-face interaction with the parents, the School Director Annie Cherian had rolled down the fee hike for this academic year on the condition that the fee would be hiked from the next academic year by 25 %. The management took exception to the statement of the parents that the fee hike was ‘sudden’. It also noted that the school has the best infrastructure, tech-supported classrooms, libraries, labs and seminar halls.

Modi taunts Opposition on ‘Kashmir PM’ plea|V. Geetanath|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday asked the Congress and other Opposition parties of the Grand Alliance to respond to National Conference leader Omar Abdullah’s assertion that Kashmir needed to have a separate Prime Minister and the State should revert back to the pre-1950 position. “The Congress Party has to answer to this demand by its alliance partner. I demand former PM Deva Gowda, former Defence Minister Sharad Pawar, Mamata Didi, ‘U Turn’ Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu to tell the people of the nation whether they support it” he asked, at a public meeting at L.B. Stadium, his second in Telangana in four days. The PM accused the Congress of “keeping quiet” whenever such statements are made and even when an NC MP had raised pro-Pakistan slogans. “This kind of mindset because of vote bank politics has made the country weak. Elections will come and go but the country has to remain strong,” he said. There are two family “political shops” in the form of National Conference and PDP in Kashmir and these parties have been holding “Delhi to ransom” but “as long as Modi is there he will not allow it to happen. This Modi will be a wall of protection between the enemies of the nation and the citizens of the country,” he affirmed, as the crowd began to chant his name. Surgical strikes The same attitude of the Opposition is making them question surgical strikes and air strikes affecting the morale of the armed forces. Stating that Hyderabad was maiden venue for him after being declared as BJP’s PM candidate five years ago, Mr. Modi said he could provide a new direction to the country with the confidence instilled in him from here. “ My government was particularly conscious of the middle class and had ensured inflation was low, subsidy provided for home loans, removed IT for salaries of up to Rs. 5 lakh, reduced power and mobile bills - all this had helped household budgets,” the PM said. All this was done without raising taxes, plugging leaks and ensuring there were no scams, hence the army too was able to get bulletproof jackets and the air force new planes when the UPA regime claimed it did not have funds. Turning his attention to TRS, the PM said any vote to ‘Car’ will be a “waste” as it was mired in dynasty and vote bank politics. He was informed the “steering was in the hands of Majlis” which did not believe in any development as was evident in the contrasting picture of the capital’s development on the other side of the Musi, which remained the same without any change.

Candidates skip electioneering in afternoon as mercury level rises|VISAKHAPATNAM|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|With the campaigning for the General and Assembly elections gaining pace, MLA and MP contestants from various parties are leaving no stone unturned to impress the voters. However, several candidates in the city are reportedly skipping electioneering during the afternoon due to the hot weather. Day temperatures in Visakhapatnam have been hovering around 35°C for the past two weeks. The sweltering heat is not only forcing people to stay indoors, but is deterring politicians and party workers from campaigning during this time. Many MLA candidates from West, North, Gajuwaka and other segments, as well as several MP candidates, are reportedly avoiding campaigns between 10am to 3pm. Candidates are now beginning their campaigns early in the day at 6am, where they interact with morning walkers and employees leaving for their jobs. Parks, Rythu Bazars, and grounds are usually preferred areas where campaigns are being organised by the politicians from 6am to 8am. The next schedule begins at 4pm after a visit to a temple, followed by meetings and rallies. Costly proposition “Campaigning after 11 a.m. cannot go on for a long time due to the hot weather. Even party workers and followers coming to take part in rallies or roadshows are wilting in the heat and are making a quick exit,” said a party worker, who has been handling the election campaigns of an MLA candidate in the city. “Daily wagers are demanding additional pay in the morning as compared to the evening. If it is in the evening, they are paid Rs. 400, but in the morning, they demand Rs. 700 per head. Moreover, there are additional expenses such as water packets and cool drinks,” another party worker said. Tailored campaigns Some politicians said that the campaign schedule is tailored separately to each constituency and the demographic profile of the voters. In some constituencies, especially semi-urban, slum and rural areas. voters need to be met in the morning.

Vishnu Kumar Raju faces an uphill task on Special Category Status, railway zone|VISAKHAPATNAM|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|For incumbent BJP MLA from Visakahapatnam- North, Vishnu Kumar Raju, the day starts at 7 a.m. The election campaign is picking up pace with every passing day and it starts with visits to various parks in his constituency and the idea is to catch up with morning walkers. But ever since he began his campaign, it has been an uphill task, as people question him about various issues such as Special Category Status and Railway Zone. He is candid enough to admit that it is a difficult task to convince people, but he puts the onus on the negative campaign being run by Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu and how he is controlling a major part of the media through paid news. “My job is to tell the truth and it is becoming a huge task,” he said. On Monday, when he was asked by a walker about SCS, he patiently explained about the concept of SCS and said that the Central Government has allocated to the tune of Rs. 17,500 crore as a special package to which Mr. Naidu had agreed and had also gone on record appreciating the Centre’s allocation in the Assembly but took a U-Turn, for reasons better known to him. Walking down a few furlongs ahead he was confronted by another walker who demanded to know why Waltair Division was abolished in the newly formed South Coastal Railway Zone, which would lead to a loss of Rs. 6,500 crore. He explained to the walker that all the money earned goes to the Indian Railway and no division or zone decides on the financial allocations for different project and it is all centralised. “But look at the larger picture and the future benefits,” he told the walker. ‘Negative campaign’ He agrees that with the negative campaign by the CM and certain sections of the media, the image of BJP has been dented but he feels that his personal image will see him through. On his winning chances and acceptance by the people he said, “I am accessible, I have worked for my constituency, I met over 70,000 people in my five-year tenure, my accountability in Assembly and people know about my integrity.” According to Mr. Raju, he was present for 126 days out of 128 Assembly days and spoke for about 31 hours and 10 minutes in the Assembly, standing next to CM with 80 hours and 44 minutes. “I acted as an Opposition leader in the Assembly, as Mr. Jagan and his MLAs were absent from March 2017. Even Mr. Jagan spoke for only 26 hours. I also worked beyond my constituency, by highlighting the need of staff nurses in government hospitals and land scams in various regions in Visakhapatnam,” he said. After his morning session, Mr. Raju visits various areas in the constituency and takes up door-to-door canvassing at each house he tries to explain that every scheme such as housing and insurance to farmers have 50% contribution from the Centre and they are not exclusive State government programmes. At the end of the day, he wraps up his meeting by holding a couple of roadshows.

Detection of high-risk pregnancies to go hi-tech|Vijayawada|April 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The ASHA workers and ANMs in Guntur district will soon be provided with tablets and a special software that will help them identify the High-Risk Pregnancies (HRPs) and ensure better healthcare services for the new mothers suffering from non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The George Institute (TGI), a global health organisation, working in association with the University of Oxford, will impart training to the non-physician healthcare works (NPHW)—ASHA workers and ANMs– to check pregnant women for hypertension, haemoglobin, blood sugar and other parameters. Special software “As part of the TGI SMART Health Pregnancy programme, the NPHWs will be trained for conducting simple clinical observations and diagnostic tests. They will enter the data on tablets. A software will analyse the data and inform the NPHW whether the case is an HRP and what follow up action should be taken,” Oxford University Hospitals Obstetrician and Senior Research Associate of TGI, Jane Hirst toldThe Hindu. Dr. Hirst was the key speaker at a national workshop on HRPs and NCDs organised here on Monday. According to him, the NCDs are the leading cause of death in women in India with a dramatic increase in cardio-metabolic disorders such as heart disease and type-2 diabetes. TGI has found that women in rural India are vulnerable to such risks owing to the poor awareness and limited access to healthcare services. High-risk conditions detected during pregnancy such as hypertensive disorders and gestational diabetes increase the risk of heart attacks. SMART programme “The share of NCDs in maternal mortality rate (MMR) is between 30% and 40%. The MMR of several developing countries and Indian States has plateaued because of the NCDs. Situation in Sri Lanka and Kerala is no exception,” Dr Hirst said. TGI has developed the SMART Health Pregnancy programme to improve the screening and management of NCDs. The steps taken by the Indian government have reduced the MMR considerably. But technology was necessary to get ahead of the game, he observed. TGI primary healthcare programme head D. Praveen said that the SMART Health Pregnancy programme would provide the NPHWs a list of women with HRPs who were either pregnant or had recently delivered. The ASHA worker would be able to counsel the women. “The meeting of stakeholders was conducted on Monday to finetune the entire programme. The pilot project would begin in Guntur in June and the project would be gradually scaled up,” Dr. Praveen said.
