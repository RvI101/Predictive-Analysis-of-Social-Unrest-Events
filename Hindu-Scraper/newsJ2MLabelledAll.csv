SC people allege discrimination|MADURAI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|A group of people belonging to Scheduled Caste (SC) communities petitioned Madurai Collector’s office on Monday alleging discrimination in the conduct of jallikattu in Avaniapuram village. The petitioners said that not a single person from any of the SC communities had been included in the organising committees formed in the village to organise the event. Pointing out that there was an issue going on between two committees over the right to organise jallikattu this year, S.P. Tamil Akilan, who belongs to the Arunthathiyar community, said that neither had any representatives from SC communities. “The committee consists of members from few dominant castes alone. In fact, we are demanding that all the 17 communities residing in the village must have representation,” he said. A. Sakthivel, belonging to Devendrakula Vellalar caste, said that the SC communities were residing in the village since time immemorial. “On the contrary, for some of the persons who are projecting themselves as leaders of the committee, Avaniapuram is not even their ancestral place,” he said. Highlighting that a peace committee meeting organised at the Revenue Divisional Officer’s level to resolve the issue between the two committees failed, he said that a meeting planned at the Collector’s level must ensure that people from SC communities get representation. “All the SC communities are together in this fight. If there is no representation, we will not hesitate to approach the Court or stage mass demonstration. We will not allow jallikattuto happen without our representation in the committee,” he added.|0|

Nurses allege they were cheated by advocate|RAMANATHAPURAM|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Alleging that they were cheated to the tune of more than Rs. 40 lakh collectively by an advocate practising in the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court on the promise of permanent jobs in government hospitals, a group of nurses urged the district administration on Monday to help them get the money back. More than 20 nurses, who were among the 48 nurses employed in primary health centres in the district on contract basis for three years since 2013, in their petition presented to Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao, said they were cheated after they gave Rs. 1.5 lakh each to the advocate, and sought his intervention to get their money back. M. Vasuki, who led the nurses, said after the completion of contract period, their colleague Rajeswari suggested that her husband Ravi, an employee in Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation, knew a senior advocate in Madurai and he could help in getting their services regularised by filing a writ petition. Initially, they gave Rs. 7,000 each and the advocate provided them the writ petition number and told them that he had filed a case on their behalf seeking a direction to the State government to regularise their services. A couple of years later, the advocate informed them that they won the case but could get the posts only if officials in the department concerned were bribed, she said. In their anxiety to get permanent jobs in government hospitals, 28 of the nurses gave Rs. 1.5 lakh each to the advocate, but they did not get jobs, she said. After realising that they were taken for a ride, the nurses presented a petition to the then Superintendent of Police, Madurai, in July 2017. Later, the Crime Branch police, after making a preliminary enquiry, said they could not take up the case as the amount involved was more than Rs. 25 lakh, which was beyond their jurisdiction. The Crime Branch police also said the advocate failed to appear before them after responding to the first summons, she said. The group of nurses also presented a petition to Ramanathapuram SP Omprakash Meena, she said.|0|
It’s chock-a-block in Puducherry on New Year eve|PUDUCHERRY|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Heavy influx of tourists from neighbouring States and lack of infrastructure in the former French outpost to handle the traffic caused utter chaos in the city, leaving the police at their wits’ end on Monday. Although elaborate arrangements were claimed to have been made, lack of adequate parking lots to accommodate vehicles transporting tourists compounded the situation. The traffic police barricaded the Law De Lauriston Street and a few other streets in the White Town to ensure smooth flow of traffic. But the police personnel posted at important junctions in the city could not regulate the flow of traffic, resulting in severe congestion all along the stretch from Mahatma Gandhi Road to Gingee Salai. Barricades placed in various parts of the city were a major obstruction to senior citizens and tourists walking towards the Beach Promenade. They found it difficult to move through the stretch. According to a police official, “All tourist vehicles including buses and vans coming from the neighbouring states were directed to be parked at the old distillery and other designated parking spaces in the White Town. Similarly, for vehicles coming from the south side, parking space had been allotted at the old and new port grounds, Indira Gandhi Sports Complex and Petit Seminaire School.” The Tourism department has projected an increase in tourist arrivals to Puducherry for this New Year. Total occupancy A majority of the hotels have recorded near total occupancy with rooms booked till January 4, while a few have blocked rooms for their regular corporate clients, an official said. The rooms had been booked more than 15 days in advance. Popular spots including the Beach Promenade and Matrimandir in Auroville are teeming with tourists. Lighting and reverberating music at hotels, clubs and resorts, which were decked up with festoons and lit up, provided a festive look. The debut edition of the Catamaran Beach Festival 2018 on December 30 and 31 at Chinna Veerampattinam beach will feature a curated multi-genre line up of 18 performing artists with the music ranging across adrenaline-driven rock to Carnatic alternative, hip hop, EDM (a variety of afro, tribal, minimalist techno and reggae). Festivities galore At The Storytellers Bar in The Promenade Hotel, partying guests were treated to rock hits from 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s presented by city-based Dhani’s Trio and DJ iSean from Auroville.

AIADMK urges Bedi to ensure law and order|PUDUCHERRY|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The opposition AIADMK has called upon the Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi to intervene and ensure maintenance of law and order in Puducherry. Referring to the recent incidents of crime, AIADMK Legislature party leader A. Anbalagan told reporters that instead of concentrating on virtually flimsy issues, Ms. Bedi must concentrate on law and order in the larger interest of the people. He said that while on the one hand the Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy was projecting various issues, on the other hand the Lt. Governor was unveiling her policies and consequently both of them are only playing a drama without taking any steps. ‘Growth rate poor’ Ms. Bedi must concentrate on procuring Statehood for Puducherry, including the Union Territory in the Central Finance Commission, working towards promotion of industries and reopening of textile mills. The growth rate in Puducherry was very poor and immediate steps must be taken to put an end to this predicament. Charging that the Chief Minister had totally failed on various fronts, Mr. Anbalagan said that instead of bringing relief to the people, he was going to head a demonstration in Delhi seeking Statehood for the Union Territory. The AIADMK is not against Statehood but there should be a coordinated approach on the part of the Chief Minister. Different stand While in Tamil Nadu Pongal gift hampers were available to all families, Ms. Bedi was taking an amusing stand that only BPL families were eligible for the gift hampers, Mr. Anbalagan added.|0|

Talaq Bill is anti-Muslim: Mehbooba|Srinagar|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Former chief minister and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti on Monday termed the Triple Talaq Bill, passed in the Lok Sabha recently, “an assault on the Muslim family structure.” “After creating divisions on religious and sectarian lines, the BJP now wants to divide Muslim families through the Triple Talaq Bill. With an economic onslaught already on against Muslims through curbs on meat and leather, the social crisis the Bill can cause will impoverish them further. It would lead to economic disturbance for men and women,” Ms. Mufti told reporters here. Herself a divorcee and a single mother of two daughters, she said Muslims take pride in their strong family structure and bonding. “The same is true of other religions in the East, considered an advantage over the Western culture. However, this Bill is a direct assault on that,” said Ms. Mufti.

Do not create panic over blood transfusion: TNGDA|MADURAI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Arguing that the recent incident of transfusion of HIV-infected blood from a donor to a pregnant woman was due to ‘negligence by individuals,’ Tamil Nadu Government Doctors Association (TNGDA) has appealed to the civil society and politicians not to create panic regarding blood transfusion. Addressing media here on Monday, K. Senthil, president, TNGDA, said raising suspicion on the entire system based on this incident would lead to difficulties during emergency situations when blood transfusion was necessary. “Public will lose trust and it will be difficult for doctors to take a call whether to proceed with transfusion or not,” he asked. He said all the procedures followed in the collection, storage and transfusion of blood in Tamil Nadu were as prescribed by National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO). Conceding the possibility that there was a need for fine-tuning the processes, he, however, stressed that it must be done at the national level. Window period He also stressed the need for understanding the fact that HIV infection might go undetected if the infected person was in the ‘window period.’ “A person who contracted the virus will not test positive before the window period, which could last from one week to three months. The tests that could possibly detect the virus within this ‘window period’ are expensive and are not used in the mandatory screening tests done now,” he said. To avoid the risks in transfusion during this ‘window period,’ he said blood transfusion must be done only when it was absolutely necessary. “Importantly, the practice of arranging donors from among friends and relatives must be encouraged,” he said.|0|

Book on jurist Habibulla Badsha released|CHENNAI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Jurist Habibulla Badsha was an amazing person and he always did what he thought was right, Dr. Prathap C. Reddy, Chairman, Apollo Group of Hospitals, said on Sunday. Speaking at the launch of the book‘When Mercy Seasons Justice’ - The Life and Times of Habibullah Badshaauthored by historian V. Sriram, he recalled how they had met in the 1950s as college students. “It was for an event in which the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru was to address students.

Hundreds exchange plastic for cloth bags ahead of ban|MADURAI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Hundreds of residents exchanged their single-use plastic products for cloth bags at an awareness initiative organised by the City Corporation, here on Monday. Ahead of the State-wide plastic ban on January 1, the local body established 16 plastic collection centres to celebrate ‘No plastic New Year and Bhogi’. Several members of resident welfare associations, school students and traders visited the stalls and exchanged their single-use plastic materials including spoons, flags, plastic covers and polythene bags. Those residents who bought their material in bulk received tiffin boxes as additional gifts. Some resident welfare associations pro-actively handed out saplings to the participants of the exchange. V. Muthupandi, a businessman from Teachers Colony, said that residents participated with lot of enthusiasm in his area. “Unless such initiatives are organised by the government, public may not know about such initiatives. Though change from plastic to other materials will be slow, it will be effective. We hope to see more awareness campaigns in the future,” he said. Corporation Commissioner S. Aneesh Sekhar who distributed bags at MGR Bus Stand said that the Tamil Nadu Government’s move to ban plastic would help in the protection of the environment, reduce littering and even save waterbodies in Madurai. “Residents should begin switching from plastic bags to cloth, jute and biodegradable alternatives as it becomes illegal to use single-use plastic from January 1. People are still using non-woven bags but this too has been banned. We hope the message reaches the people,” he said. He added that the Corporation often managed to collect mounds of plastic waste during their cleanliness drives on the Vaigai river bank. “Plastic bags often lead to soil degradation and do not allow groundwater percolation. With the support of the public and trade bodies, we can make a significant difference,” he said. He also said that cloth bags should be reused and citizens should take carriers to restaurants for their takeaways to prevent use of plastic in the future.|0|

First-ever list of forward castes soon|KOCHI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The first-ever list of forward caste Hindus and Christians of the State will be out shortly. There are 83 Hindu and 20 Christian castes on the draft list drawn up by the Kerala State Commission for Economically Backward Classes among Forward Communities. The commission, which has placed the draft list within the public domain, is expected to finalise it after January 20. The list is being prepared as part of the exercise to identify the economically backward classes among the forward communities. Besides the 83 Hindu castes, there are 62 sub-castes, including 24 sub-castes of Nairs, on the list. The 14 sub-castes of the Ambalavasi Hindus and six for the Kshatriya caste are there on the list. From the Brahmin caste, 13 sub-castes have been identified by the commission. Christian communities numbering 20, including Chaldean Syrians, CSI, Evangelical, Basel Mission, Pentecosts, Marthomites, Malankara Catholic, and Jacobites are there on the draft list. The commission will also fix an annual income ceiling, akin to the creamy layer fixed for Other Backward Communities (OBC), as the benchmark for identifying the economically weaker sections among the forward communities. Even while preparing the caste database of these communities, the commission paid attention to the castes that were out of the ambit of the caste-based reservation, said V.M. Gopala Menon, member secretary of the commission. No authentic data Though the communities together constitute 27.73% of the State's population, no authentic data on these castes and population are available. Earlier, two attempts for a headcount of these castes were made at the national level. However, the Central government has not released the caste data so far, said Mr. Menon. At the same time, the data on Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and OBCs, which enjoy the benefits of caste-based reservation, are readily available in the State. Interestingly, a few of the forward caste organisations have approached the commission with a request not to classify them as forward or upper caste communities as they feared such classifications would eventually deny them government aid. Instead, they preferred to be called communities which were out of the ambit of caste-based reservation in the State.|0|

Sajjan sent to jail after surrendering in court|New Delhi|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Former Congress leader Sajjan Kumar on Monday surrendered before a local court to serve the life sentence awarded to him by the Delhi High Court for murder of five Sikhs during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. Former MLAs Krishan Khokhar and Mahender Yadav, who were also convicted in the same case and awarded 10-year jail terms each, surrendered before the court earlier during the day. Kumar, 73, was sent to Mandoli jail in northeast Delhi by metropolitan magistrate Aditi Garg. The judge rejected his plea that he be sent to the high-security Tihar jail as the case pertains to the Delhi Cantonment area, which comes under the jail’s jurisdiction. Separate van The court was informed by authorities that all convicts are first taken to Mandoli jail and from there they may be shifted, if required. “Since there is security threat to the convict, he be provided a separate van for travelling from court to jail and from jail to court,” the magistrate said in the two-page order. Kumar, a former MP, has already filed an appeal in the Supreme Court challenging the conviction and life sentence awarded to him by the High Court. The High Court had earlier this month declined his plea to extend the December 31 deadline for surrender by a month. Khokhar and Yadav were sentenced to three years in jail by the trial court for various offences during the riots, but the High Court enhanced their punishment to 10-year jail terms.|0|

AFSPA to continue in Nagaland|New Delhi|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The entire State of Nagaland has been declared ‘disturbed area’ for six more months, till June-end, under the controversial AFSPA, which empowers security forces to conduct operations anywhere and arrest anyone without any prior notice. In a notification, the Home Ministry said the Central government is of the opinion that the area comprising the whole of State of Nagaland is in such a disturbed and dangerous condition that the use of armed forces in aid of civilian power is necessary. “Now, therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 3 of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 (No. 28 of 1958), the Central government hereby declares that whole of the said State to be a ‘disturbed area’ for a period of six months with effect from 30th December, 2018, for the purpose of that Act,” the notification said. A Home Ministry official said the decision has been taken as killings, loot and extortion have been going on in various parts of the State which necessitated the action. There have been demands from various organisations in the Northeast as well as in Jammu and Kashmir for repealing the controversial AFSPA, which, they say, gives ‘sweeping powers’ to security forces. The AFSPA has been in force in Nagaland for several decades. It has not been withdrawn even after a framework agreement was signed on August 3, 2015, by the Naga insurgent group NSCN-IM general secretary Thuingaleng Muivah and government interlocutor R.N. Ravi in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The framework agreement came after over 80 rounds of negotiations spanning 18 years with the first breakthrough in 1997 when the ceasefire agreement was sealed after decades of insurgency in Nagaland.|0|
Plastics ban comes into effect today|CHENNAI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Even as the State-wide ban on 14 kinds of plastics and thermocol, including carry bags, comes into force on Tuesday, the State government is geared to “seal, seize and stop” those who don’t follow the rule. For the ordinary consumer, it says: “Don’t forget to carry your own cloth/jute bags or baskets for shopping since even reusing plastic carry bags could be questioned.” Environment Secretary Shambu Kallolikar toldThe Hinduthat their agenda would be to ensure that the ban is implemented in full. “We will seal units that manufacture such items, seize the banned items from retailers, wholesalers stockists and manufacturers and stop anything that comes from outside the State,” he said. Notices issued The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board has issued notices to 1,400 units asking them not to manufacture any of the banned items. “Most of these are multi-product manufacturers, if they continue to manufacture these items, officials will take action on the entire unit,” he said. The movement of goods across the State was being monitored online with the help of e-way bills. “We are working with the Commercial Taxes Department. If there is any suspicious movement, physical checks will also be done,” Mr. Kallolikar added. Asked about extended producers responsibility, he said that it too would soon be implemented. Local bodies have been asked to seize banned goods, and send them to cement kilns for co-processing. A total of 140 authorised waste handlers have also been identified for taking the plastic wastes. However, since rules for imposing fines are yet to be imposed, it will take some time for such action. Meanwhile, manufacturers protesting the ban have decided to keep their units closed. Tamil Nadu Vanigar Sangankalin Peramaipu president A.M. Vikramaraja said traders had been educated to not possess any banned items. “It will no doubt be difficult for traders since they are used to giving carry bags to customers,” he said. Meanwhile, residents have been requested to not throw banned plastic items into bins but hand them over at local body ward offices or to recyclers for safe disposal. For any enquiries, consumers can call the helpline numbers 044 - 22343153 or 8056042121.|0|

Sonia, Rahul never interfered: Antony|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|“The government and the BJP are misusing agencies to manufacture lies. I am surprised to know that the present government is spreading lies...is trying to manufacture something out of nothing,” he said. The Congress and the BJP have been engaged in a bitter war of words since Saturday when the Enforcement Directorate told a Delhi court that Christian Michel, the alleged middleman in the AgustaWestland VVIP helicopter scam, had passed on a paper containing questions on “Mrs. Gandhi” to his counsel Aljo K. Joseph, a former Youth Congress office-bearer. Mr. Antony said if the Congress had anything to hide, it would not have ordered a CBI probe or gone to Milan, Italy, to fight the case. “When reports came in that there was corruption in the deal, I ordered a CBI investigation. We took the decision to fight the case in Milan. Ultimately, we won the case and got the entire money from bank guarantees and advance,” he said. ‘Professional decision’ The former Defence Minister said the choice of AgustaWestland helicopters was a “professional decision” taken by the Indian Air Force, the Special Protection Group and the Defence Ministry. “We cancelled the contract and started proceedings of blacklisting. But after we left, the Modi government did nothing against AgustaWestland. Instead of acting against the company, they favoured it.” Mr. Antony said the BJP was trying to divert attention from the questions raised over the Rafale deal and avoid a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) probe into it and that’s why it was raising the AgustaWestland case.|0|

According to sources, 25 members — 13 from the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and six each from the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) and the JD(U) — may walk out or abstain if a vote is called. The AIADMK and the TRS have rarely voted against any government legislation. The Biju Janata Dal (BJD), which has maintained equidistance from both the government and Opposition blocs, is backing the Bill. The Opposition is confident of the support of 116 members out of the total strength of 245.|0|

Police told to arrest woman for trying to hoodwink court|Madurai|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Taking serious note of the abuse of the court process by a petitioner, the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court directed the Pudukottai police to arrest and remand a noon meal worker to judicial custody for a week for attempting to hoodwink the court. The court was hearing the writ petition filed by the woman from Pudukottai, who sought a direction to the authorities to reinstate her in service with back wages. In 1999, the woman had joined as a Second Grade Anganwadi worker under the noon meal scheme in the Manamelgudi taluk. Subsequently, the woman was placed under suspension and dismissed on charges of not attending duty on the day of an inspection, not taking proper care of the children and preparing meals under unhygienic conditions. ‘Dismissal illegal’ Denying the charges, the petitioner said she had availed the leave with prior permission and the suspension notice was not served to her and therefore the dismissal was illegal. During the course of the hearing it was learnt that that the woman was dismissed from service for being absent for long without notice and failing to let the authorities know that she had taken up a job as a labourer in Singapore. The woman challenged the claims saying that she had not travelled abroad and produced a passport. However, the woman later wanted to withdraw her petition. Smelling a rat, the court directed the police to probe the matter. Following an investigation, it was established that the woman had travelled abroad on her relative’s passport to take up a job.|0|
Govt. rejects demand to send Bill to panel|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Monday’s debate on the Bill started at two in the afternoon, with eight members of the AIADMK trooping into the well continuing their protests against the Central Water Commission’s approval for the Mekadatu Dam. Trinamool Congress MP and floor leader Derek O’Brien then moved a resolution — signed by 11 MPs, including AIADMK’s A. Navaneethakrishnan — to send the legislation to a select committee. Mr. O’Brien pleaded with Deputy Chairman Harivansh, who was in the chair, to take the sentiment of the House that was in favour of sending the Bill for further parliamentary scrutiny. Leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad, too, backed him by saying more than half the members supported the call. “The government tries to bulldoze every legislation through. Since this Bill did not go through one in the Lok Sabha, it should be sent to [a] select committee here,” he said. Junior Parliamentary Affairs Minister Vijay Goel interceded to say that the Congress-led Opposition which was stalling the Bill even as the government was ready for a debate. Ruckus again Amid pandemonium, the House was adjourned at 2.10 p.m. for 15 minutes. When the House reconvened, Deputy Leader of the Opposition Anand Sharma reiterated the demand, saying the Rajya Sabha does not exist merely to “rubber stamp” legislation cleared by the Lok Sabha. Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad responded, saying the government was ready for a debate and to hear all suggestions proposed by the Opposition, but the Bill must not be put in limbo by sending it to a select committee. He said even after the Supreme Court’s judgement outlawed instantaneous divorce, an incident of triple talaq had been reported.|0|

Replying to the question, the Ministry said that the ASI takes up a survey for documenting/reporting ancient monuments/sites through exploration, and that a village-to-village survey and conservation of monuments is a continuous process. According to the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958, an “Ancient Monument means any structure, erection or monument, or any tumulus or place of interment, or any cave, rock-sculpture, inscription or monolith which is of historical, archaeological or artistic interest and which has been in existence for not less than 100 years."" There were 3,686 centrally protected monuments/sites under the ASI in the country; the number has now increased to 3,693. Uttar Pradesh (745 monuments/sites), Karnataka (506) and Tamil Nadu (413) have the highest number of ASI-maintained sites. According to information available with the Ministry of Culture, about 321 of these centrally protected monuments/sites have been encroached upon."|0|

Centre gives Rs. 1,146 crore more for cyclone relief|CHENNAI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|A high-level committee chaired by Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Monday approved an additional Rs. 1,146.12 crore from the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) for carrying out relief and restoration work in the delta districts ravaged by Cyclone Gaja. The committee is comprised of Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Union Minister for Agriculture Radha Mohan Singh and NITI Aayog vice-chairman Rajiv Kumar. Talking toThe Hindu, Commissioner of Revenue Administration K. Satyagopal said the Rs. 1,146.12 crore was in addition to the Rs. 550 crore available with the State Disaster Response Fund. When asked about the State government’s request for the sanctioning of Rs. 14,910 crore towards permanent restoration work, Mr. Satyagopal said the NDRF funds were meant only for temporary relief, and funds for permanent restoration work could come only from the different Ministries under the Central government. “We cannot compare the funds we had sought for permanent restoration with the funds received for temporary restoration from the NDRF,” he said. The Tamil Nadu government had sought Rs. 2,709 crore for temporary relief. With the sanctioning of Rs. 1,146 crore on Monday, a sum of Rs. 1,696.12 crore is available with the State for disaster relief. In the wake of the severe damage caused by the cyclone, primarily in the Cauvery delta districts, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi and sought an interim relief of Rs. 1,431 crore towards temporary relief and restoration work and Rs. 14,910 crore for permanent restoration activities. An inter-ministerial team visited cyclone-hit areas and submitted its report to the Centre. Cyclone Gaja made landfall on November 16 last year and claimed 52 lives. On December 3, the Centre released Rs. 353.70 crore as interim relief. Not enough: PMK The PMK criticised the Centre for approving merely Rs. 1,146 crore in relief assistance, and urged it to sanction the Rs. 15,000 crore sought by the Tamil Nadu goverment towards permanent restoration work. In a statement, PMK leader and former Union Minister Anbumani Ramadoss claimed that the damage incurred by the State due to Cyclone Gaja was actually to the tune of Rs. 25,000 crore, but the State government had sought only Rs. 15,000 crore. “While so, the Centre has approved only Rs. 1,146 crore, which is not acceptable,” he said.

A forgettable year for industries|Chennai|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Industries in Tamil Nadu had a wobbly start in 2018, but ended on a good note. After the police firing that killed 13 protesters in May, Vedanta Limited’s Sterlite Copper smelter in Thoothukudi had to down its shutters based on a State government order. A handful of downstream industries said that their business was impacted due to the closure. The people of Thoothukudi had been complaining that the plant was a major polluter for several years. In September, there was a labour unrest in Chennai, the Detroit of South, with employees of Yamaha and Royal Enfield going on protest demanding better wages and recognition for their unions. After several rounds of negotiations with the management and the Labour department, the workers went back to work. Chennai which has installed capacity to produce one motorcycle every six seconds breathed easy. Meanwhile, the fireworks industries in Sivakasi downed their shutters demanding lifting of ban on use of certain chemicals by the Supreme Court. In a policy note tabled by the MSME Department in the Assembly, it was revealed that close to 50,000 micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) have been wound up in the State. The struggle continues for both. At the textile hub, Tirupur, there were several concerns — the government had reduced the duty drawback given to garment exporters. The incentive given at 4% under Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) would not continue in 2019, as the US, the EU and Russia lodged a complaint with the WTO stating India no longer qualified to give subsidy to its exports, as it had already reached the per capita income of US $ 1000 per annum consecutively for three years since 2015. Exports from Tirupur though will clock Rs. 24,315 crore in 2018, compared to Rs. 25, 013 crore recorded in 2017. On the positive side, the State was ranked second in the State Investment Potential Index 2018 data released by the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER). In 2017, it was ranked sixth. In July, CEAT inked a pact with the State government for setting up a tyre manufacturing facility entailing investments to the tune of Rs. 4,000 crore. Another big news for the State this year was Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn deciding to make top-end iPhone models at its facility near Sriperumbudur. The IT sector, which employs over 4 lakh people, fared well with a few investments during the year and Chennai being acknowledged as the SaaS (Software As A Service) capital. Unkept promises During the year, Ministers at several forums organised by the chambers of commerce and industry bodies promised that many policies would be rolled out to boost the industries across the State but only one saw the light of the day. After a decade, the State rolled out a revised Information Communication Technology Policy 2018. But the start-up policy has not made progress. The Rs. -200 crore Amma Venture Capital Fund, which was discussed at several start-up and IT forums, has also not seen any progress. With the State getting ready for its second edition of the Global Investors Meet in January 2019, industrialists are hopeful that the business environment would be more robust and positive in the future.|0|
Govt. Estate Metro station to be linked to subway|CHENNAI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|When the final stretch of the Chennai Metro Rail on Anna Salai opens in a few weeks, commuters can access the Government Estate station from the Anna Subway, as one arm of the subway will be linked to the tunnel. The entry/exit of the Government Estate station, located close to the Tamil Nadu Government Multi Super Speciality Hospital at Omandurar Estate, will be connected to one of the three arms of the subway. Sources in the Highways Department, under whose control the subway falls, said that they were informed about the proposal but were yet to get the details. “Since only one arm is to get connected, most probably, the other two would remain accessible during the work. This subway witnesses a considerable number of footfalls,” an official explained. According to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), a passenger entering the subway can easily walk into the concourse level of the station and then go to the platform. “The work to link the subway with entry/exit of this station will begin soon. The idea is to improve mobility for commuters. Also, the entry/exit of this station and few other structures will bear similarity with the golden facade of the hospital. We specially planned this with aesthetics in mind,” an official said. Chennai Metro Rail has begun repaving the road near the station and other parts of Anna Salai.

M.P. CM wants Collectors to be called administrators|Chhindwara|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|"Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath on Monday said he wished to change the designation ‘Collector’ to ‘District Administrator’ claiming that the former was an archaic British term. He was speaking after holding a meeting here, the first in his Lok Sabha constituency since taking over as the Chief Minister on December 17. “The designation Collector was in vogue during the time of the British. I sought suggestions from the people on why this designation should continue. I asked the Collectors of districts on how they should be redesignated,” Mr. Nath said. “What does DC [District Collector] stand for? I don't want it. I feel the designation of Collector should be changed to district administrator,” he said. Earlier at a function in Bhopal, Mr. Nath had said the designation ‘Collector’ was a British legacy and did not go down well in the present context. In a lighter vein, he asked if a Collector ""collected things, like tickets etc."". The term Collector is believed to have entered the official lexicon when Warren Hastings was British India’s Governor-General in 1772."|0|
Madras varsity receives report on IDE answer script theft|CHENNAI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|At least a dozen persons are believed to have been involved in the theft of answer scripts belonging to the Institute of Distance Education of the University of Madras.

We will study the report and discuss on the next course of action in the next Syndicate,” Mr. Duraisamy said. “Since the report was tabled only during the meeting, we could not discuss it. There was only one copy of the report. The report proves that theft had occurred and that it was due to negligence of the staff. We were told that 13 persons were accused in the theft of the answer scripts,” said a member. At the meeting, the Syndicate decided that it would call for fresh applications for the post of dean of College Development Council.

Passengers with Reservation Against Cancellation (RAC) tickets would not have to wait for getting a berth, as the devices would provide available vacancies in real time. Southern Railway has done away with the cumbersome process that comes with using paper charts by distributing these terminals to TTEs. Pilot project R.K. Kulshrestha, General Manager of Southern Railway, distributed the devices to TTEs of the two Shatabdi trains at the launch function held at the Chennai Central Railway Station on Monday. Mr. Kulshrestha said 20 machines had been distributed as part of the pilot project, under the Digital India campaign. The machines would be put to use from Tuesday on Shatabdi Expresses that are operated from Chennai to Coimbatore and Mysuru. Quick updates The pilot project has been launched in the Chennai Division of the Southern Railway. A senior railway official said tablets linked to the passenger reservation system would give a quick update of seats available, help in quick scanning of tickets, seat vacancies against last minute cancellations, allotment of berths and faster refund to passengers who fail to show up.|0|

Ready for debate on Rafale: Cong.|NEW DELHI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Congress on Monday said it was ready for a debate in the Lok Sabha on the Rafale deal, and requested Speaker Sumitra Mahajan to hold it on January 2. “Jaitleyjihas thrown a challenge ... We are ready for debate on January 2. Please decide a time,” said the Leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge. Mr. Kharge got up from his seat and made these remarks soon after the Lok Sabha passed a Bill to give its approval to an additional gross expenditure of Rs. 85,948.86 crore during the current fiscal ending March 2019. Demand for JPC probe When the Lok Sabha met after the lunch break, Mr. Kharge reiterated the party’s demand for a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) investigation into the Rafale deal. At this point, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley told Mr. Kharge that the Opposition should allow the discussion on the supplementary grants, and said the government was prepared to give a reply. When Mr. Kharge accused the Finance Minister of “running away” from discussion, Mr. Jaitley hit back stating that a discussion on the Rafale deal would make it clear the Congress was “spreading lies over the deal”. When the House was about to be adjourned for the day, Mr. Kharge reminded Ms. Mahajan of the demand for a debate and sought time for it. “You keep your challenges to yourself. Don’t challenge me,” an angry Speaker retorted. Congress members were shouting slogans on the Rafale deal through the day and during the Zero Hour at noon. Mr. Kharge raised the demand for a JPC investigation once again, and asked why the government was not disclosing the price of the fighter jets. UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi was present in the House. Home Minister Rajnath Singh intervened and said that repeating the “same lie again and again will not make it a truth”. BJP members too countered the Congress members with loud protests. Amid the din, BJP member Ravindra Kumar Pandey raised the instances of jobs not being provided under the MGNREGA in Jharkhand. Bhratruhari Mahtab of the Biju Janata Dal raised the issue of UPSC candidates with a non-English medium background being affected by the introduction of the Civil Service Aptitude Test (CSAT) in the Civil Services examination.|0|

DMK to announce candidate on Jan. 4|CHENNAI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Election Commission’s decision to conduct the byelection to the Tiruvarur Assembly constituency alone for the time being, instead of holding polls in all 20 vacant constituencies at once, has offered an advantage to the DMK, as it could focus its energy on known turf. Late DMK leader M. Karunanidhi, who had contested in many constituencies across the State during the course of his political career, chose to enter the fray in Tiruvarur — his home town — in the 2016 Assembly poll after it became a general constituency in the wake of delimitation. He won the seat with the highest margin — 68,366 votes. Immediately after the announcement of the bypoll on Monday, the DMK leadership called on aspiring candidates to submit their applications between January 2 and 3. Each application would cost Rs. 25,000. DMK president M.K. Stalin said that candidates would be interviewed on January 4, and the party’s pick would be announced the same day. “We will evolve a strategy to win the polls. The Lok Sabha polls, slated for 2019, will bring about a great change in politics,” he told reporters. CPI’s support CPI State secretary R. Mutharasan said that his party would support the DMK’s candidate in the byelection. “We have a good base in the constituency, and contested the 2016 polls as part of the People’s Welfare Front. Now, as a friendly party of the DMK, we will work for its candidate,” he said. CPI(M) State secretary K. Balakrishnan said that the objective was to defeat the AIADMK and the BJP, adding that his party would evolve a strategy accordingly. The AIADMK has asked candidates to submit their applications by January 3. The party will scrutinise the applications on January 4.   We will evolve a strategy to win the polls.

30 lakh reapply for inclusion in NRC|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|“While this came as a relief for many, others hit the hurdle of not being allowed to use a fresh legacy. This meant applicants could not change the person from whom they had drawn their ancestry in the original application that was rejected at the time of the complete draft,” he said. There have been cases in which illiterate people, dependent on NRC Seva Kendras or cybercafe operators, used the same legacy person as others genealogically linked to someone else. While some cases were fraudulent, many were cases of the legacy person having the same name or belonging to the same area. A legacy person is one who figures in the NRC of 1951, which is being updated, the voters lists published up to March 24, 1971, and other documents, including refugee registration certificate. “What marked the claims round was lack of campaign or awareness drive. An overwhelming majority of the ground-level officials appeared ignorant of the court’s directives and many of those manning NRC service centres went beyond their brief to reject documents whimsically,” said Dharmananda Deb, an advocate and activist in Silchar. The deadline for completing the exercise after processing the claims and objections is June 2019. The service centres, officials said, would be open from January 2 to 31 for correction of the names published in the complete draft.|0|

30 lakh reapply for inclusion in NRC|GUWAHATI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|About 30 lakh of the 40.07 lakh people left out of the final draft of the updated National Register of Citizens (NRC) published five months ago have applied again for inclusion during the claims and objections round that ended on Monday. During the phase, 600 objections also came in from those who doubted the citizenship of others included in the draft. Deadline extended The window for 40.07 lakh of the 3.29 crore applicants excluded from the complete draft was opened on September 25. It was to have closed on December 15, but the Supreme Court, which is monitoring the exercise, extended the last day to December 31 after the Assam government said the panchayat election, held on December 5 and 9, had robbed the people and officials of precious time. NRC officials said the pace of submission of claims had picked up in the last fortnight. “As of Sunday, 30 lakh of those excluded from the complete draft reapplied. With some more submitting their claims today [Monday], the reapplication works out to 75%,” an official said. A.B. Khandakar, a Guwahati-based activist, said the number of applications increased after a clause was removed from the standard operating procedure issued by the Centre. That clause had made documents obtained after August 31, 2015, “inadmissible” for claims. “While this came as a relief for many, others hit the hurdle of not being allowed to use a fresh legacy. This meant applicants could not change the person from whom they had drawn their ancestry in the original application that was rejected at the time of the complete draft,” he said. There have been cases in which illiterate people, dependent on NRC Seva Kendras or cybercafe operators, used the same legacy person as others genealogically linked to someone else.

Hotels embrace ban, say rates may go up|CHENNAI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Ever since the ban on plastics was announced by the Tamil Nadu government, hotels and restaurants across the State are working on various options and some have even adopted innovative methods. While some hotels have embraced the traditional methods, others have asked customers to bring in their own vessels for takeaways. Hotel Saravana Bhavan, one of the largest food chains, has informed all its branches to stop using plastic and start using paper-based products. Similarly, Dindigul Thalappakatti has started using wooden spoons and paper straws. Its Managing Director, Sathish D. Nagasamy, said instructions had been given to all their branches to use paper bags. “Over 30% of our business is through takeaways,” he added. Sastharam Ravendran, founder, Madras Curry Cup, said, “We were using a combination of glass, eco-friendly plates likepaaku mattaiandthonnaiat some outlets, bio-degradable carry bags, and thicker reuse capable plastics boxes with 60 ppi or more that the government has not banned.” Hoteliers across Chennai said that they are prepared for the ban but the biggest challenge is bridging the gap between demand and supply. Since everyone is now looking at alternative options, there is a huge shortage. “My supplier has said that he does not have sufficient cloth bags to give me. Supply is a constraint,” said a city-based hotelier. He added, “Prices of eco- friendly products could have been subsidised. Or input credit tax could have been enabled for restaurants, so it would have helped us offset the price hike. Now we have no choice but to absorb part of the cost increase and pass a part to the consumers.” Many hotels have indicated that they would have to increase the rates on their menu cards. Vivek Srinivasan, executive director, Sree Annapoorna Sree Gowrishankar Hotels, said the cost of a south Indian meal could go up by nearly Rs. 30 if we cannot use plastic pouches to pack liquid food items, such as sambar and rasam.” A south Indian meal will have at least eight varieties of food. “We use plastic pouches now. We can go in for bio pouches but might not be able to pack hot food in it. So the option is to go in for plastic containers that can be reused,” he said. Hotel Nalan, which has two branches in Coimbatore, has asked its customer to bring containers for takeaways.  Food delivery platforms are prepared for the plastic ban and are working with hotels across Chennai. “We plan to give benefits to restaurants that are shifting to eco-friendly packaging by providing them additional marketing visibility benefits on our platforms — app and web. This will help offset any additional cost for partner outlets through higher customer interest,” said a spokesperson of Zomato. The spokesperson further added, “Bamboo products [which also provide employment to tribal communities], corrugated paper with coatings and sugarcane bagasse products will be also supplied.” Swiggy is launching ‘Swiggy Packaging Assist’ Program — a marketplace for restaurant partners to access a variety of packing solutions. Small eateries Roadside eateries and small restaurants (which operate out of a 300 sq ft space) are still evaluating how they can replace plastic. Some of them even said that the ban would not last long and would die a natural death. A restaurant owner in Triplicane said, “A few months back there was a huge noise about banning Coke and Pepsi and now that issue is dead and the products are back on shelves. How long will the government keep monitoring usage of plastics,” he asked.|0|
JD(U) stance a worry for BJP|NEW DELHI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Janata Dal (U) has reservations over the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2018, also known as the triple talaq Bill. According to top sources in the party, the JD(U) has issues with the criminalisation clause in the Bill which has a provision of three years’ imprisonment in case of triple talaq. Sources also said the party wanted stakeholders from the Muslim community to be consulted over the Bill. This is a setback for the government as the JD(U) as an NDA ally is not fully backing the Bill, especially in the Rajya Sabha, where the numbers situation is precarious. “Senior leaders of the party were not in Delhi today so we cannot say if the JD(U) will entirely go with the Opposition demand for referring it to a Select Committee but we have serious reservations on the Bill,” said a senior MP from the JD(U). The last time the government passed the triple talaq Bill, the JD(U) voted with the treasury benches. Not on the same page Party sources maintain that there is nothing new in their differences with the BJP on certain issues. “We have already expressed our differences with the BJP over the Ram Mandir issue as well as others,” said the source. The Rajya Sabha was adjourned till Wednesday and the battle over the Bill is expected to begin again then.|0|
We have to live without plastics, says Jayakumar|CHENNAI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|With the ban on specific items of plastic coming into effect across the State on Tuesday, Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar on Sunday appealed to the general public to extend cooperation to the government’s decision. “For more than 100 years, plastics and humans were like an inseparable couple. But, now times have changed and it is time for a divorce. We have to live without plastic. That is the compulsion of our times,” Mr. Jayakumar said. Talking to reporters here, Mr. Jayakumar recalled that a carcass of a sperm whale that washed ashore had 15 water bottles and 150 plastic cups and said it was the magnitude of the menace. Usage of plastic affected rainwater harvesting and plastics, which replaced banana leaves, affected cows that feed on food, he said. “So, we are left with no option but to implement the ban on the selected 14 items of plastic. While so, the High Court is suggesting extending the ban on all plastics without any exemption. We are for protecting the environment, which has been the people’s intention,” Mr. Jayakumar said.  Now, times have changed and it is time for a divorce D. Jayakumar Fisheries Minister|0|

Study into infant deaths at Attappady|Thiruvananthapuram|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|A study will be held under UNICEF into the infant deaths at Attappady, Minister for Health K.K. Shylaja has said. She was speaking after a review meeting at Agali and Kottathara in the wake of infant deaths reported from Attappady. The Minister said a UNICEF team would reach Attappady at the end of January. Doctors from various medical colleges would be part of the team. The Palakkad District Medical Officer would visit Attappady once a month to review the situation. The Health Director too would make visits periodically, she said. Ms. Shylaja said some of the infant deaths in Attappady could not be avoided. The number of infant deaths had been brought down to eight at one point of time. Its increase to 14 was the reason for the study. However, there was no reason to panic; it was possible to bring down the infant mortality rate, she said. More employees had been posted at the Kottathara tribal hospital. It had adequate facilities, and more would be sanctioned if needed. She said the presence of doctors in all primary health centres in Attappady had been ensured.|0|
2018 was a landmark year for BJP, women in Northeast|GUWAHATI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Bharatiya Janata Party expanded its footprint across the Northeast in 2018 by forming coalition governments in Manipur, Nagaland and Tripura. But a regional party, Mizo National Front, struck the final blow in Mizoram to make the region “Congress-free”. The year was also the best and the worst for women in the Northeast. Assam’s sprinter Hima Das made history for Indian athletics by striking gold in the 400m at the World U-20 Athletics championship in Finland and Manipur pugilist M.C. Mary Kom created a world record at 35 by winning her sixth gold at the World Women Boxing championship. Assam’s Rima Das became a household name when her low-budget filmVillage Rockstarsgot the best national film award and was nominated as India’s entry for the Oscars in the best foreign films category. On the flip side, Meghalaya-based activists Agnes Kharshiing and Amita Sangma battled for life after members of alleged coal mafia assaulted them for following and documenting illegally stacked coal and coal-laden trucks. The assault on them and a mishap in an illegal mine at Ksan in the State’s East Jaintia Hills district a month later put the spotlight on an unholy nexus that encourages coal mine owners – many of them lawmakers – flout an April 2014 ban by NGT on ‘rat-hole’ mining with impunity. NRC, Citizenship Bill The issue that hogged the headlines was that of exercise to update the National Register of Citizens in Assam and the Narendra Modi government’s bid to pass the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016, that seeks to legitimise the stay of non-Muslims who migrated from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan till December 2014 due to alleged religious persecution. The defining moment of the NRC exercise began past the midnight of December 31, 2017, with the publication of the first draft that accommodated 1.39 crore out of the 3.29 crore applicants. The complete draft was released on July 31 with the names of 40.07 lakh people left out of the list. The claims and objections round for the excluded to be back on the list by producing relevant proof of citizenship ends on December 31. The crowning glory for Assam was the appointment of Ranjan Gogoi, the man at the helm of the Supreme Court-monitored NRC, as the first Chief Justice of the apex court from the Northeast. The BJP, which began its ‘saffron surge’ in the region by winning the Assam elections in 2016, formed the government in Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh in 2017. In March, it swept the Left Front out of Tripura, ended Congress rule in Meghalaya with the help of regional allies, and chose a new regional partner to continue the NDA reign in Nagaland. But the BJP’s gamble on ethnic minorities did not quite come off in Mizoram. The MNF – a member of the BJP-helmed North East Democratic Alliance – ended the 10-year rule of the Congress to return to power. The BJP in Assam saved the blues for the party in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan to win 41% seats in the panchayat polls. This indicated that the anger in Assam against the Citizenship Bill did not have much impact on the rural electorate. But the Bill was seen as one of the reasons of the perceived resurgence of extremist groups such as the United Liberation Front of Asom-Independent. Security forces blamed the outfit for killing five Hindu Bengalis, seen as beneficiaries of the Bill, in eastern Assam’s Tinsukia district. Connectivity and wildlife Connectivity in the Northeast came a long way with a slew of highway and railway projects having been undertaken or completed. The highlight was the inauguration of the 4.94 km Bogibeel Bridge, India’s longest rail and road span, across the Brahmaputra river and the construction of the piers of the world’s tallest railway bridge on the Jiribam-Imphal railway line under way. The year also saw hurdles such as land acquisition being removed for Hollongi, the first major civilian airport project in Arunachal Pradesh. Inland water connectivity too received a boost with two barges carrying 1,233 tonnes of bagged fly ash from Bihar reaching Guwahati’s Pandu port in less than a month to rekindle hope for a transport system that had virtually ended with Partition in 1947. The Centre also signed a protocol with Bangladesh, which will allow Indian ships to access Mongla and Chittagong ports in the neighbouring country. But the expansion of railway and road network has been at a cost – shrinking of space for wildlife leading to train-hits. The resultant man-elephant conflicts have claimed the lives of 67 elephants and 75 humans. The year ended for Assam recording more human deaths due to conflict with animals than natural disasters. Data with the Assam State Disaster Management Authority said floods and landslides killed 53 people in 2018.|0|
‘State judiciary bogged down by unfilled vacancies’|CHENNAI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Judicial officers are hoping that judicial vacancies across the State are filled in 2019, as it would speed up disposal of cases in each district. Speaking on condition of anonymity, a judicial officer pointed out that even significant posts such as presiding officers of mahila courts, family courts, special courts for exclusive trial of land grabbing cases, motor accident claims tribunals and labour courts were lying vacant with other judicial officers given additional charge. A news report carried inThe Hinduon December 26 regarding district courts in the State all set to enter 2019 with a backlog of over 11 lakh cases has caused a quite a stir among judicial officers, who blame the huge number of judicial vacancies in almost every district for the delay in disposing of 6.24 lakh civil and 4.80 lakh criminal cases. “Mahila courts are constituted for the specific purpose of expeditious disposal of cases within six months. The Supreme Court itself has been monitoring the progress of such courts. Yet, the posts of presiding officers of Mahila Courts in Erode, Madurai and a few other districts have been lying vacant for long, causing grave injustice to victims,” a trial judge said. According to him, victims of rape and molestation have no choice but to appear before the in-charge courts on a regular basis, listen to the next date of adjournment and repeat the sequence over and over again. “Such unproductive adjournments may lead to witnesses’ memory fading and in fact, help the accused escape from the clutches of law,” he added. Another judicial officer pointed out that the posts of secretary to District Legal Services Authority and chairperson of Taxation Appellate Tribunal Authority in municipal corporations were also lying vacant in some districts, causing hitches in the conduct of legal awareness camps in villages and providing free legal aid to the poor. When contacted, the office-bearers of Tamil Nadu Judicial Officers Association (TNJOA) refused to comment on the issue. Game changer However, Madras High Court officials involved in the recruitment process were confident that 2019 would be a game changer in filling up of judicial vacancies in the State. According to them, vacancies in mahila courts and family courts could be filled up only with judicial officers in the cadre of district judge. Since, filling up those vacancies through promotions would cause a sudden vacuum in the feeder category of civil judges, it was decided to fill up the latter first before taking up the former. It was in 2015 that the last recruitment of civil judges took place in the State. A year later, the Rights of Persons with Disablities Act came into force. Though the High Court quickly identified the posts, which could be reserved under the Act, the State government took quite a long time to approve the list and issue a government order. “Finally, a notification was issued on April 9, 2017, calling for applications for approximately 320 civil judge vacancies. More than 8,000 candidates applied. After a conducting a main examination for them, followed by a preliminary examination for shortlisted candidates and then a viva voce, we have now provisionally selected more than 220 civil judges,” a judicial officer said. “This recruitment has been completed in record time. These judges will join service soon and undergo in-service training at Tamil Nadu Judicial Academy in batches. Once these judicial officers settle down, we will commence filling up vacancies in the cadre of district judges too through promotions as well as direct recruiment,” the officer asserted.|0|
Policemen lose job for missing arms|Srinagar|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Four policemen were dismissed from service on Monday in Kashmir, a day after four service rifles went missing from the residence of a senior Congress leader in Srinagar. A police spokesman said the personnel, posted as Special Police Officers (SPOs) at the Srinagar residence of senior Congress leader and MLC Mohammad Muzaffar Parray, were dismissed for “dereliction of duty and unauthorised absence.” Three policemen were from the security wing and one from the Sopore district police. The move also coincided with the attachment of Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP), Security Kashmir, Maqsood-ul-Zaman, with the Security Headquarters in Srinagar. “Sajad Hussain, SSP Commandant JKAP-3rd Bn, in addition to his own duties, shall look after the work of SSP, Security Kashmir, till further orders,” said an official order. High-security zone The four service rifles were found missing on Sunday from the guard room in the high-security zone of Jawahar Nagar after one of the four SPOs reported it to the police. The police, which launched an investigation, did not rule out the possibility of the weapons landing with militant outfits.

Nashik court acquits 7 in fake stamp paper scam|Pune|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|A special court in Nashik on Monday acquitted seven persons, including deceased counterfeiter and prime accused, Abdul Ladsab Telgi, alias Kareem Lala, in the multi-crore stamp paper scam. The charges against Telgi, alleged to be the kingpin behind the scam that spread across several States, were abated following his death in Bengaluru in 2017. Citing “lack of concrete proof”, Additional Sessions Judge P.R. Deshmukh acquitted all accused in the case pertaining to the fake stamp paper racket that was first registered in Nashik in 2000. Forty-nine witnesses were examined in the Nashik case. While Mumbai was Telgi’s “nerve centre” for printing fake stamp papers, Nashik, being the location of the India Security Press, was where it all began. Telgi had connived with officials of the press to create counterfeits of legal documents, including stamp papers, revenue stamps and judicial court fee stamps.

Two held for assaulting paediatrician|Hyderabad|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Two persons, who allegedly assaulted a paediatrician at his clinic in Himayatnagar on Friday, were arrested by the Narayanaguda police late on Sunday night. Earlier on Monday, paediatricians in the city shut down their clinics and went in a delegation to meet Director General of Police M Mahender Reddy demanding action against the culprits. The accused, Gulam Mustafa and Abdul Fazil, alleged that Dr. Michael Aranha misbehaved with the former's wife. Police said the incident happened on Friday night when the woman approached Dr Arhana's clinic with her child. “Following an issue, the woman's husband along with his friend Fazil attacked the doctor, as a result he suffered multiple rib fractures and pneumothorax (punctured lungs) and is undergoing treatment in a private hospital” said inspector P Ramesh Kumar.

HIV donor’s death: more doctors to do post mortem|MADURAI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Madurai Bench of Madras High Court on Monday ordered that two doctors from government hospitals outside Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) be involved in the conduct of post-mortem of the HIV-infected blood donor, who died at the hospital on Sunday. Despite Monday being a holiday for the court, Justice B. Pugalendhi heard the petition moved by the family of the deceased youth. Raising suspicion over his death, the family approached the court after the GRH administration refused their demand to involve doctors from outside the hospital and videograph the post-mortem. The judge said two Assistant Professors from the medical college hospitals in Theni, Sivaganga or Tirunelveli could be involved along with senior GRH doctors. The court ordered the GRH Dean to try to engage a person for videographing the the procedure. If no one could be engaged, the Dean should try to instal two additional cameras on the post-mortem hall to record the procedure, the judge said. “In case it (the installation) is not possible within the short duration, it may be intimated to the petitioner in advance so that the petitioner could arrange for videographing,” the court said, adding if the petitioner was arranging a person for videographing the procedure it must be permitted by the Dean. Stating that the order was made considering the special circumstances of the case and it must not be taken as a precedence for cases of unnatural deaths filed under Section 174 of the Cr.P.C., Justice Pugalendhi, however, ordered the government to explore the possibility of installing cameras in all post-mortem centres as it was crucial in cases of homicidal suicides. The case of the young blood donor gained importance as the blood he donated was transfused without screening to a pregnant woman, who contracted both HIV and Hepatitis B infections. She is undergoing anti-retroviral therapy at the GRH now.|0|

Meanwhile, tourists and local tribal people are experiencing severe inconvenience as construction of cottages, being undertaken by the AP Tourism Development Corporation, is yet to be completed. “Four temporary cottages are ready and a trial run is being finalised. Lack of a kitchen has delayed the opening of these cottages,” Tourism RD Radhakrishna Murthy toldThe Hindu. “There are 41,000 students of 105 Ashram Schools in the 11 mandals of the Agency. It would have been better if the schools are closed now instead of summer,” said a private employee, whose wife works at a school. “The temperatures have been extremely low in the region during the last few days,” RARS Associate Director DV Ramana Reddy toldThe Hindu. “Temperatures have come down all over the world, the ‘Siberian high’ is also strong this year, ” said SVSS Ramakrishna, a professor in the Department of Meteorology and Oceanography, AU.

Two Pak. intruders killed on LoC|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The spokesman said the intruders were wearing combat uniforms like Pakistani regulars and were carrying stores with Pakistani markings. “They had intruded well-equipped with improvised explosive devices and a plethora of arms and ammunition. It was obvious they intended to carry out a gruesome attack on the Army’s forward post in Naugam sector,” he said. The intruders, he said, attempted to exploit the thick jungles close to the LoC and were assisted by heavy covering fire of high-calibre weapons from the Pakistani posts. “The fire-fight initiated by Pakistan was given a strong response and the exchange of fire continued the whole night,” said the spokesman. “A few intruders managed to escape, taking advantage of the Pakistani firing and adverse weather conditions,” he said. Some intruders, he said, were seen wearing BSF and old Indian Army fatigues. The Army will ask Pakistan to take back the bodies of the two intruders. Akhtar Ayub, an Athmuqam-based disaster risk management officer in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, told the Pakistani media that “Indian Army shells were first aimed at Pakistan Army posts but later started pounding civilian installations at Athmuqam.” He claimed a 27-year-old woman died in the shelling.|0|

Wooden structures found in water-filled mine|GUWAHATI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Personnel of multiple agencies engaged in the search and rescue operation for at least 13 miners trapped in a coal mine at Ksan in Meghalaya’s East Jaintia Hills, found wooden structures, coal and mud near the bottom of the pit on Monday. Six divers of the Indian Navy and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) had on Sunday detected a few rat-holes — narrow tunnels into which miners have to crawl to extract coal. Ready for dewatering R. Susngi, spokesperson for the district administration, said the site had been cleared for the Odisha Fire Service to start pumping out water from the main shaft measuring about 150 sq ft in area and about 350 ft deep. Other shafts were being prepared to keep at least three of the 10 high-power pumps brought from Odisha operating for longer durations, he said. “The Navy divers entered the main shaft to survey the bottom using under ater remotely operated vehicle (UWROV). In three hours of their scan under water, they found some wooden structures, coal and mud other than a rat-hole with coal at its mouth. The visibility was poor, about 1 foot at the bottom,” Mr. Susngi said. A member of the Navy team, which was flown in last week from Vishakhapatnam, said the search for the trapped miners would be feasible when the level of water goes down. The Navy requested the district authorities to assist in dewatering so that the level comes down to 30 metres or within a safe diving limit. Two teams of the NDRF have been providing support to other agencies like the Navy and the State Disaster Response Force.|0|
After the ban, focus now shifts to alternatives|CHENNAI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|With the ban of single-use plastics coming into force, the growing focus now is on alternatives. Edible cutlery, paper straws and jute bags instead of plastic covers, and dried lotus leaves instead of plastic plates are some of the options that the Tamil Nadu government has been encouraging as an alternative. In a bid to provide information as well as offer sustainable solutions, a group of residents from the city, who want to take a positive and proactive approach, have come together to startwww.chennaiagainstplastics .com. “There are so many small groups and businesses working on alternatives that we thought they can be given a platform. Through the portal, we will be providing information about the rules pertaining to the ban as well as a list of vendors who can be reached for alternatives,” explained Chitra Krishnan, a retired academician who is part of the initiative. The recently launched website seeks to primarily provide alternatives to not just single-use plastic, but also plastics across various categories as well as offer sustainable solutions. This, the team says, will be updated. In addition, they will also be working on providing resources about waste management and water management. Once the ban comes into effect, the website will also have a blog that will chronicle the efforts taken by individuals or small businesses to effectively adapt to the alternatives available.  “At this stage, the mindset needs to change among people and it should be a conscious choice to reach out for an alternative to plastics. We are further planning to reach out to schools as well so that students can be made aware,” Ms. Krishnan added. Shifting slowly A few larger businesses in the city have begun to slowly shift to alternative solutions. However, many small vendors remain unclear about what to offer as replacement or where to source alternatives that are not expensive. A. Rani, a fruit vendor in Abhiramapuram, said, “Where do we go? There are people who still ask us for carry bags and we are wondering where to go and get a replacement.”|0|
JPC clears its report on citizenship Bill|New Delhi|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Citizenship Amendment Bill 2016, which proposes citizenship to persecuted minorities barring Muslims from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, is likely to table its report on January 7 on the penultimate day of the winter session of Parliament as the panel on Monday cleared the report rejecting all amendments moved by the Opposition. At Monday’s meeting, out of 30 members, all the 13 BJP members were present. And only six Opposition members were present. The draft report will be circulated on January 3 and it will be tabled on January 7. The Opposition is now planning to file dissent notes to the joint committee’s report. The report will clear the decks for the legislation to become a reality. The Bill proposes citizenship to six persecuted minorities — Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, Parsis, Christians and Buddhists — from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh who came to India before 2014. Resentment in Assam There has been a strong resistance to the Bill in the BJP-ruled Assam as it would pave the way for giving citizenship, mostly to illegal Hindu migrants from Bangladesh, who came to Assam after March 1971, in violation of the agreement in the Assam Accord of 1985. Around 40 lakh people in Assam have been excluded from the final draft of the National Register of Citizens published in July. Rejected amendments include those moved by Trinamool Congress MP Saugata Roy to make the legislation religion- and country-neutral. Mr. Roy said the Bill should not limit itself to six religions. It should instead say that any person who leaves his country due to religious, linguistic and ethnic discrimination should be eligible for Indian citizenship. He also moved that Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan should not be the only countries named in it, since “we have huge number of refugees from Sri Lanka and Myanmar too”. The Opposition was stumped when the committee under the chairmanship of BJP MP from Meerut, Rajendra Agarwal, called for a meeting on a day’s notice. The two BJP members from Assam, Ramen Deka and Kamkhya Prasad Tasa, have been maintaining a studied silence on the Bill in the meetings of the committee. The BJP government in Assam is fiercely opposed to the Bill. The BJP’s ally Asom Gana Parishad too has been protesting against it and has threatened to walk out of the alliance if the Bill is passed. The committee has cleared an amendment moved by BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi seeking to drop legal proceedings against six persecuted minorities. The amendment, if accepted, could mean that Bangladeshi Hindus lodged in detention centres in Assam, facing deportation or declared illegal foreigners would get relief.|0|
HC stops Bhim Army from holding meet in Pune|Pune|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|A day ahead of the 201st anniversary of the battle of Bhima-Koregaon, the Bombay High Court on Monday denied permission to the Uttar Pradesh-based Bhim Army to hold a public meeting in Pune on Tuesday. The court, however, imposed no restriction on Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad ‘Ravan’ from visiting the village of Bhima-Koregaon, 30 km from Pune city, on January 1, the battle's anniversary. Security shield Officials from the Pune police, who were present in the court, submitted that they were not detaining Mr. Azad in Pune, despite a significant security shield outside Sagar Plaza Hotel in the city where he is staying. Mr. Azad was to address the Bhima-Koregaon Sangharsh Mahasabha in Pune’s SSPMS grounds. “It is surprising that the court’s refusal to grant permission for our rally rested on technicalities like obtaining ‘clearance’ from the SSPMS ground authorities. The court never mentioned any possible ‘untoward situation’ arising out of Mr. Azad’s presence – as has been hinted to us by authorities since he entered Maharashtra on December 28,” said Datta Pol, Bhim Army’s Pune district president. Mr. Pol, toldThe Hinduthat Mr. Azad’s planned interaction with Ambedkarite students at the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU), has also been cancelled. ‘Tension in campus’ Both events, to be held on December 30, had to be cancelled after the SSPMS ground authorities denied permission for a public meeting, and the SPPU authorities refused Mr. Azad permission to interact with students saying his presence “would create tension” in the campus. The same day, advocate Nitin Satpute moved the High Court seeking “urgent relief” for Bhim Army to hold its proposed public meeting in Pune and demanding action against the State government for allegedly violating Article 19 (freedom of speech and expression) of the Constitution.|0|

Home buyers fear dilution of Real Estate Act|NEW DELHI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) plans to push through some of the suggested changes to the RERA (Real Estate Regulatory Authority) Act, 2016, through a ‘Removal of Difficulties’ order, which does not require Parliamentary approval for amendments. The window for such a process ends on May 1, 2019. However, home-buyers worry that such orders will dilute the Act’s pro-consumer provisions. A number of suggestions to change the Act and to improve implementation were made during four regional workshops held over the last few months, MoHUA secretary Durga Shanker Mishra said on Monday. Representatives from State RERAs, consumer and home-buyer federations, as well as builder and real estate groups, had participated in the workshops. “We have compiled the suggestions and we will see which of these changes can be made through the Removal of Difficulties clause,” said Mr. Mishra, adding that a committee set up for the purpose would meet on January 3. Its recommendations would then be sent to the Secretary and the Minister for approval. Section 91 of the RERA Act gives the Centre power to issue orders to make provisions to remove difficulties in implementing the Act. Cause for concern Abhay Upadhyay, president of the Forum for People’s Collective Efforts set up to protect homebuyers and facilitate RERA implementation, is a member of that panel, but believes that making major amendments under the guise of a Removal of Difficulties order will be counter-productive. “Builders are demanding amendments to definitions that will change the very fabric of the Act,” he said. The Act was passed by the Parliament and received the President’s assent in March 2016. Certain sections, including Section 91, were notified on May 1, 2016. Others were notified on May 1, 2017. “The government seems to be arguing they can continue to amend sections notified in 2017 until May 2019,” said Mr. Upadhyay.|0|

Gandhis have deep ties with Michel: Shah|NEW DELHI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|BJP president Amit Shah on Monday launched a frontal attack on the Congress over the Enforcement Directorate’s submission to a Delhi court saying the alleged middleman in the AgustaWestland deal, Christian Michel, has named UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Congress president Rahul Gandhi under interrogation. Mr. Shah accused the Gandhi family of having a “time-tested and deep” friendship with Mr. Michel. In a series of tweets, Mr. Shah sought to know why Mr. Michel passed on the details of questioning on Ms. Gandhi, an apparent reference to the UPA chairperson, to his lawyer. “Does anyone know why Christian Michel passed on the details of questioning on Ms. Gandhi to his lawyer? Did he want them to be passed on to Ms. Gandhi herself? Why?” Mr. Shah asked, referring to a slip being passed by Mr. Michel to his lawyer Aljo Joseph. “Michel’s lawyer has admitted that the paper was indeed passed on to him,” Mr. Shah said.|0|
PMK criticises Centre; demands more funds|CHENNAI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|"The Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) has criticised the Home Ministry committee for approving merely Rs. 1,146 crore for restoration work in the wake of Cyclone Gaja and has urged the Centre to sanction the Rs. 15,000 crore sought by the Tamil Nadu goverment towards permanent restoration work. In a statement, PMK leader and former Union Minister Anbumani Ramadoss claimed that the damage incurred due to Cyclone Gaja was actually to the tune of Rs. 25,000 crore but the State government sought only Rs. 15,000 crore. ""While so, the Centre has approved only Rs. 1,146 crore, which is not acceptable at all,"" Mr. Anbumani pointed out.

Even for relief after Cyclone Ockhi, the State government sought Rs. 9,300 crore but only Rs. 133 crore was sanctioned by the Centre, he said.

Plea to defer HC division|NEW DELHI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Andhra Pradesh High Court Advocates Association in Hyderabad on Monday moved a petition in the Supreme Court to defer the implementation of a notification, issued on December 26, bifurcating the Hyderabad High Court into the Andhra Pradesh and Telangana High Courts. From January 1 As per the notification, the two separate High Courts have to start functioning from January 1. The petition is likely to be listed for hearing before the Supreme Court on January 2. The petition urged the court to delay the bifurcation till the new premises for the Andhra High Court in the capital city of Amaravati were completed. The High Court is now set to function from temporary premises till the construction work is over. The petition sought urgent orders and said the plea would be rendered infructuous if the two High Courts were allowed to function from January 1. ‘Judges satisfied’ The petition comes despite the fact that Andhra Pradesh had informed the Supreme Court that the judges, who would preside over the courtrooms of the new High Court, were satisfied with the facilities in an interim building complex which would house the High Court till a permanent building was constructed. The State government had submitted that a Full Court of the High Court approved the proposal after the inspection committee of judges submitted a report. Senior advocate Fali Nariman for Andhra Pradesh had also made a statement that the government would be hiring villas to take care of the residential needs of the judges at Amaravati. The court had taken on record the submissions made by the Andhra government that a “very big complex known as Justice City is under construction” in Amaravati. This complex would house the High Court, subordinate courts and even some tribunals. It would also have provision for the construction of a residential complex for the High Court and lower court judges. The interim building for the Andhra Pradesh High Court, the Supreme Court recorded, is only an “ad hoc arrangement till the Justice City gets completely constructed”.|0|
‘Sonia, Rahul never interfered in defence deals’|NEW DELHI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Former Defence Minister A.K. Antony on Monday said the Gandhi family had never interfered in any defence deals during the UPA regime and accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government of pursuing “vendetta politics without an iota of truth.” He accused the government of using the investigating agencies to “manufacture lies” and the BJP of “spreading lies.” Clean image The Congress fielded Mr. Antony, known for his clean image, to defend its leadership after the Bharatiya Janata Party stepped up its attack on the Gandhi family. “I would like to say categorically that Sonia and Rahul never showed any interest... never interfered in the AgustaWestland deal.

I am surprised to know that the present government is spreading lies...is trying to manufacture something out of nothing,” the senior Congress leader said.|0|

Assam MLA picks holes in Modi claims|GUWAHATI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|A lawmaker in Assam has come out with data on the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Urban to pick holes in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s claim that the State had seen unprecedented development since 2014. Mr. Modi had on December 25 outlined a slew of projects undertaken or completed in the northeastern States, including Assam. “Either the Prime Minister is unaware or he has been misled by the Sarbananda Sonowal government to make such claims. There is hardly any progress in Assam, and one does not need to go beyond PMAY-Urban to find out,” Anwar Hussain Laskar, the All India United Democratic Front legislator from Hailakandi constituency told reporters on Monday. Referring to data obtained from the State Mission Directorate, he said only 11 of the 57,364 approved houses under PMAY-Urban had been completed since 2015.|0|
Mayawati puts Congress governments on notice|LUCKNOW|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati warned the Congress on Monday that if it did not immediately revoke cases filed against “innocent persons” during the April 2 Bharat Bandh called by Dalit groups, her party might have to “reconsider” support to the grand-old party’s governments in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.  ‘Withdraw cases’ “If the newly elected governments in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan do not act swiftly and withdraw the cases against the innocent persons framed in Bharat Bandh, the BSP may have to reconsider extending outside support to the Congress governments,” she said in a hard-hitting statement issued here. The BSP has two members in Madhya Pradesh’s 230-member Assembly, while in Rajasthan her party has six seats in the House of 200 MLAs. Ms. Mayawati said the issue was a major one “connected to the interests of Dalits and tribals”. She said cases were lodged against innocent people due to the “casteist and political malice” of the previous BJP governments in many States, including those won by the Congress now. The Congress had supported the protests in April 2018 against the changes to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act which had witnessed instances of violence in parts of north India. The Congress governments should avoid the BJP’s track record of betraying promises made to farmers and the unemployed, the BSP chief further said in the statement. “It is important to give the Congress this warning before the upcoming Lok Sabha election, because now mere announcements won’t suffice,” she said. Ms. Mayawati said that when it came to announcements, people believed that the BJP and Congress were tarred with the same brush and it was up to the Congress to change that impression.

It was N.G.N. Ranagantha Asari, an ace carpenter from this village, who completely transformed the instrument, which is now known aspari nagaswaram. December 2018 marks the birth centenary of the Ranganatha Asari, who produced the instrument in collaboration with nagawaram wizard Thiruvavaduthurai T.N. Rajarathinam Pillai. “Rajarathinam Pillai wanted to replace the old, shorttimiri nagaswaraamwith a new instrument because it could not produce themathyama sruthiperfectly. He worked together with Ranganatha Asari and produced an instrument. The result is terrific. We have a pleasing sound and the instrument is also easy to handle,” said Kalaimamani Kilvelur M.G. Ganesan, a senior nagaswaram player. Mr. Ganesan, who has purchased about 200 instruments from Ranganatha Asari, said great players like Karukurichi Arunachalam and Namagiripettai Krishnan also used the instrument made by Ranganatha Asari. “Rajarathinam Pillai was pleased with the sound of the instrument and presented Ranganatha Asari a pair of diamond ear-rings. Karukurichi Arunanchalam gifted him a diamond ring,” recalled Mr. Ganesan. 36 inches longer Before the arrival ofpari nagasaram, thetimiriwas used by nagaswaram players. Thetimiriproduced a high-pitched sound and demanded enormous physical effort from the musician handling it. The improvedpari nagaswaramis 36 inches long. “Timiriwas needed when there were no loudspeakers. Singers also rendered songs in a high pitch to reach out to the man sitting in the last row. Modern audio systems rendered them [these efforts] unnecessary. My father used to tell me that many nagswaram players suffered from hydrocele because oftimiri,” recalled nagaswaram player Enjikudi E.M. Subramaniam. The pipe (ulavu) of the nagaswaram is made of from the wood of theacha maram, which is known for its hardness. The lower section (anusu) is made from the wood of thevagaitree. But nagaswaram makers now are also known to purchase old wooden pillars for creating the instrument. Nagaswaram makers have also modernised their units, with machines replacing hand-drilling tools and chisels. Ranganatha Asari's sons continue to make nagaswarams today.  The result is terrific. We have a pleasing sound and the instrument is also easy to handleM.G. GanesanNagaswaram player|0|
Get ready to sober up on the roads this year|AloK deshpande Mumbai|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|To ensure safety on roads and to discourage cases of drink driving, the State has now decided to suspend driving licence of offenders for six months instead of the current three. This was announced by Transport Minister Divakar Raote announced on Monday after a meeting of the State Road Safety Council at Sahyadri guest house. In another major step, it was decided to if any vehicle was plying without an insurance policy or with an expired insurance, the owner would not be fined, but the vehicle would be towed away from the spot. “It has been observed that many accidents happen due to driving under influence of alcohol. The RTO and traffic police personnel have started taking action to stop this menace and in the last two months action was taken against 12,000 drivers for flouting rules. A majority of these were cases of drunk driving,” said Mr. Raote. Mr. Raote said that any vehicle plying without insurance policy or with an expired insurance policy earlier attracted monetary fine. “In case of any accident of this vehicle, the travellers do not get any benefits of insurance policy. This has to be stopped,” he said. As per the council’s decision, such vehicles will be towed away from the spot and will be returned only after producing new insurance scheme and the receipt of the amount paid for insurance. “A system will be set up under which car owners will be informed about the expiry date of the car insurance policy. This work can be assigned to unemployed youth, or self help groups and the cost for it can be collected from the car owners,” Mr. Raote said. Directions have also been issued to file cases against private travel buses which are found transporting parcels, goods and courier without valid permits. These buses have permit to transport travellers only. Meanwhile, the transport department has made available a travel safety fund of Rs. 246 crore which will be used to purchase speed guns, alcohol meter, interceptor vehicles and speed cameras.|0|
Congress reverses BJP’s decisions in Rajasthan|Jaipur|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Congress government’s move, in its first Cabinet meeting here, to reverse some controversial decisions of the previous Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) regime in Rajasthan gives indication that the ruling party is readying for the 2019 Lok Sabha election. The Cabinet’s prompt decision has come in for praise from civil society groups. The Cabinet has taken a slew of decisions, ranging from the elimination of educational qualification for Panchayati Raj elections, the reopening of universities and removal of Deendayal Upadhyaya’s logo from official documents to direct elections to the Mayor’s post and the appointment of a committee on eligibility for the waiver of farmers’ loans. Health Minister Raghu Sharma said that the government would review all decisions taken in the past six months. Minister of State for Education Govind Singh Dotasara has announced a review of school textbooks and other reference materials that were revised by the BJP. The government has abolished the criteria of educational qualification of candidates for Panchayati Raj bodies, introduced by the BJP regime through an Ordinance in 2014, to ensure that each citizen gets the right to contest. The People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) has welcomed the move, saying it had done away with a “highly discriminatory” provision that had led to the exclusion of 73% of the population above 21 years of age in rural areas. “This was an elitist law, denying equal opportunities to citizens who did not have the means for securing education,” PUCL-Rajasthan president Kavita Srivastava said on Monday. The government has also ordered the removal of the logo of Deendayal Upadhyaya from the official letterheads of Ministers and government functionaries. Social activist Sawai Singh, president of Rajasthan Samagra Seva Sangh, said there was no justification for eulogising a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ideologue and undermining the significance of the Sarnath pillar as the national emblem. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has also handed over the Congress party’s manifesto to the Chief Secretary with the direction that it should be treated as the State government’s policy document.|0|
‘Offence committed in line of duty’|Mumbai|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|While acquitting 22 of those accused of the killing of Sohrabuddin Shaikh, Kausar Bi and Tulsiram Prajapti, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court earlier this month said: “The alleged offence was committed by the accused persons in discharge of their official duty and under the colour of office; even if it is assumed that the accused persons acted in excess of their official duty, then also they are entitled to claim protection of Section 197 (prosecution of judges and public servants) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).” Entitled to acquittal The Hinduhas a copy of the 358-page judgment, which says: “It is clear that the accused who are police officials and who were found doing the act and deed in discharge of their official duty, are entitled for the benefit as contemplated under Section 197 of CrPC.” “It was necessary for the investigation agency to obtain sanction of the competent authority before filing chargesheet. In absence of the sanction, the accused are entitled for acquittal.” In his last judgment, judge S.J. Sharma said: “The accused, as seen from the material in the chargesheet, were certainly acting in discharge of their official duties. There is reasonable connection between the ‘act’ and discharge of official duty... The accused were doubtlessly a ‘public servant’ when the alleged offence is alleged to have been committed.” The court said, “The entire investigation was targeted to act upon a script to achieve the goal to anyhow implicate political leaders....” Motivated probe Indicting the investigating agency, Justice Sharma said: “The negligence of CBI towards material part of investigation clearly indicates that they hurriedly completed the investigation either by using replica of the earlier recorded investigation and have implicated the police persons who had not at all knowledge of any conspiracy; rather they appeared innocent.” “There is no hesitation in recording that during the investigation of these offences, the CBI was doing something other than reaching the truth of the offences.” Justice Sharma also said: “The evidence could not withstand the judicial scrutiny of the Court.”|0|
‘New CRZ notification is a death knell for coastal communities’|Special Correspondent Panaji|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Describing the Coastal Regulation Zone(CRZ) notification of the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests as a “death knell to the coastal communities”, the Centre for Responsible Tourism(CRT) Goa, a Church-affiliated organisation, on Monday demanded the withdrawal of the notification. The organisation, which has been promoting the cause of coastal communities as first beneficiaries of tourism in the coastal State of Goa, issued a statement saying the clauses in the notification are detrimental to coastal ecology, will displace local communities, and affect biodiversity of coastal regions in the country, including Goa. “The Coastal Regulation Zone notification of 2018 is a planned erosion of the CRZ notification 2011. By reducing the CRZ area to a mere 50 mts from the hazard lines, it will create an environmental crisis and damage the fragile coastal ecology resulting in imminent floods. This notification does not protect the ecology and livelihoods of the coastal inhabitants,” it said in a strongly-worded statement. The CRT has said that the notification, issued last week, permits activities like reclamation of land for commercial activities, interference with sand dunes, large-scale recreation and drawing of ground water within the 200-500 metres from the high tide line, which is “detrimental to the coastal ecology and that will displace the local communities and affect the bio-diversity are granted positive approval” and went on to criticise the notification for “the wilful dilution and reduction in the protection given to the environment it categorically permitted”. “This notification regularises the violations to CRZ and opens the way to further destruction of our coastal ecology,” the statement said demanding its withdrawal. Noting its stand as pro-people, the Church-affiliated bodies in Goa have opposed several projects, including mega real estate projects in the environmentally fragile coastal villages Goa and State’s recent Master Plan of Tourism.|0|

Sajjan sent to jail after surrendering in court|New Delhi|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Former Congress leader Sajjan Kumar on Monday surrendered before a local court to serve the life sentence awarded to him by the Delhi High Court for murder of five Sikhs during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. Former MLAs Krishan Khokhar and Mahender Yadav, who were also convicted in the same case and awarded 10-year jail terms each, surrendered before the court earlier during the day. Kumar, 73, was sent to Mandoli jail in northeast Delhi by Metropolitan Magistrate Aditi Garg. The judge rejected his plea that he be sent to the high-security Tihar jail as the case pertains to the Delhi Cantonment area, which comes under the jail’s jurisdiction. Separate van The court was informed by authorities that all convicts are first taken to Mandoli jail and from there, they may be shifted, if required. “Since, there is security threat to the convict, he be provided a separate van for travelling from court to jail and from jail to court,” the magistrate said in the two-page order. Appeal in SC Mr. Kumar, a former MP, has already filed an appeal in the Supreme Court challenging the conviction and life sentence awarded to him by the High Court. The High Court had earlier this month declined his plea to extend the December 31 deadline for surrender by a month. Khokhar and Yadav were sentenced to three years in jail by the trial court for various offences during the riots, but the High Court enhanced their punishment to 10-year jail terms. The High Court on December 17 convicted Kumar of killing five Sikhs in the Raj Nagar area during the riots which broke out in the capital in the aftermath of the assassination of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. It overturned an April 2013 judgment of a trial court here which acquitted Kumar, saying he was the leader of the mob and actively abetted the commission of crimes by his repeated exhortations to the mob to indulge in the mayhem and kill innocent Sikhs.|0|
Who killed the probe, asks Jaitley|NEW DELHI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Monday targeted the Congress over the verdict in the Sohrabuddin case, asserting that it was a reflection on the politicisation of the CBI under the previous government. “More relevant than the order of the acquittal is the observation of the judge that in the investigation, from the very beginning, investigating agency did not investigate the case professionally in order to find out the truth but to divert it towards certain political persons,” Mr. Jaitley wrote in a blog post titled “Who killed the Sohrabudin investigation?” Referring to Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s comment on the day of the judgement that “nobody killed Sohrabuddin”, Mr. Jaitley wrote: “It would have been more appropriate if he [Mr. Gandhi] had asked the right question, namely who killed Sohrabuddin case investigation, he would have got the right answer.” “Those who have recently shown a belated concern for institutional independence, should seriously introspect as to what they did to the CBI when they were in power,” Mr. Jaitley wrote. He recalled that he had written a letter to the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on September 27, 2013, detailing the politicisation of the investigation.|0|
Sudhir Bhargava is new CIC chief|NEW DELHI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The government has appointed Sudhir Bhargava the new Chief Information Commissioner. Four new members have also been appointed to the Central Information Commission (CIC), taking its strength to seven. Four vacancies still remain. The CIC is the highest appeal body under the Right to Information Act. It has been functioning with just three members since the former chief and several members completed their tenure last month. Mr. Bhargava, a former Secretary to the Social Justice Ministry, will be sworn in by President Ram Nath Kovind on Tuesday. He has been a Commissioner since June 2015, and will take over as the ninth chief of the CIC. As all of his predecessors, he is a retired bureaucrat. New commissioners All four new commissioners are also retired bureaucrats. Yashwardhan Kumar Sinha was High Commissioner to the U.K. Vanaja N. Sarna was chief of the Central Board of Excise and Customs. Suresh Chandra retired as Union Law Secretary earlier this year. Neeraj Kumar Gupta was Secretary in the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management. Lack of transparency Activists have slammed the government for a lack of transparency in the appointment process, as no details on the shortlist or the search committee have yet been made public. On December 13, the Supreme Court directed that such details be made available. “Once the commissioners take the oath of office, we will put the entire file on the process online. We have time until the next hearing date on January 22,” a DoPT spokesperson said. “What is the point of such post-facto information? The details should have been put out before the appointment was made to ensure transparency,” said Anjali Bhardwaj, co-convener of the National Campaign for the People’s Right to Information.|0|
Government to set up food processing units on pilot basis soon|HYDERABAD|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Telangana would have food processing industries set up by the State government involving the women self help groups of Indira Kranthi Patam in the coming year by taking it up on a pilot basis in six or seven mandals to begin with.  Crop colonies This was stated by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao at a review meeting held here on Monday on shaping up the food processing industry in the State. He wanted the officials to work out on dividing the total area of cultivation in the State into crop colonies so as to ensure remunerative price to the farmers’ production by meeting the available demand. Stating that lack of proper data on agriculture and food grains production and consumption patterns has been leading difficulties in planning programmes for addressing the problems of farmers, the Chief Minister told the officials concerned to study the aspects in minute detail. The Chief Minister said mobilisation of farmers and educating them on market-driven crop production by setting aside traditional cropping patterns was bound to bring expected results for their benefit as well as consumers. Chief Secretary S.K. Joshi, Advisers Rajiv Sharma and Anurag Sharma, Principal Secretaries S. Narsing Rao (CMO), C. Parthasarathi (Agriculture), K. Ramakrishna Rao (Finance) and Jayesh Ranjan (Industries), DGP M. Mahender Reddy, TSIIC Chairman G. Balamallu, former minister Ch. Muthyam Reddy, several legislators and others attended. He said that the food processing units proposed to be established by the State Government would bring out unadulterated branded food products by procuring the raw material directly from farmers by offering proper price to the produce. The farmers would be guided to raise their crops in a regulated manner. First step towards mobilising farming would be training to the members of Rythu Samanvaya Samithis and recruitment of more agriculture extension officers. Stating that he had met agriculture economist Ashok Gulati during his recent visit to Delhi, the Chief Minister said the former had agreed to visit the State and conduct workshop on these issues related to agriculture.|0|
Review hearing in open court rare|NEW DELHI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The decision of a five-judge Bench led by Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi to have an open court hearing of the review petitions filed against another five-judge Constitution Bench’s Sabarimala judgment is “exceptional”, legal experts say. The turn of events is quite extraordinary that an echo can be found 43 years ago in the open court review of the historic Kesavananda Bharati verdict in November 1975. That review, however, was short-lived. On the third day of the court hearing, then Chief Justice of India A.N. Ray abruptly dissolved the Review Bench. Again, the Sabarimala judgment, which struck down a ban on women of menstruating age from undertaking the pilgrimage, was delivered by a Constitution Bench of five judges. The Review Bench formed by Chief Justice Gogoi is also a five-judge Bench. The Supreme Court decision in the Central Board of Dawoodi Bohra Community holds that a Bench of co-equal strength on its own cannot overrule a judgment of a Bench of co-ordinate number of judges. So, a five-judge Bench cannot overrule another five-judge Bench’s verdict. In case the Sabarimala verdict has to be overruled, the Supreme Court would have to form a larger Bench of seven judges. Landmark order The Kesavananda Bharati judgment was delivered by a 13-judge Bench – the largest Constitution Bench in the history of the Supreme Court – on April 24, 1973. Through a wafer-thin majority of 7:6, the 13-judge Bench formulated that the Basic Structure of the Indian Constitution cannot be altered by Parliament through amendments. The Review Bench with Chief Justice Ray had also comprised 13 judges. If at all, the Kesavananda Bharati judgment had to be set aside, it would have been necessary to set up a Review Bench of 15 judges. In his biography of Nani Palkhivala called The Courtroom Genius, senior advocate Arvind Datar described the 1975 attempt to review the Kesavananda Bharati verdict as a “clumsy attempt.” Palkhivala had argued for the petitioners in the Kesavananda Bharati case and against its review. Finally, the 49 review petitions challenging the Sabarimala judgment question the very content of the verdict. This again is quite similar to how the Kesavananda Bharati review had questioned the core of the 1973 landmark verdict. The question framed in the review was “whether or not the basic structure doctrine restricted Parliament’s power to amend the Constitution.” Review of any Supreme Court decision is rare. It is rarer still to examine review petitions filed against a Constitution Bench judgment. That too, in the open court. Review petitions are usually decided by circulation in judges’ chambers.  Antulay judgment The philosophy behind a review is explained in the A.R. Antulay judgment of the Supreme Court wherein the court admitted that it can be fallible. “To err is human. Courts including the apex one are no exception,” the court had acknowledged. Advocate Kaleeswaram Raj said the situation was rare as a Constitution Bench is itself formed to finally settle the law. “When there is a difference among smaller Benches on what law is, the question of law is referred to a Constitution Bench for a final opinion… to review a Constitution Bench judgment is rare,” he said.|0|
Chamling urges people to uphold peace in Sikkim|Gangtok|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST| Sikkim Chief Minister Pawan Kumar Chamling on Monday urged the people to uphold the hard-earned peace, goodwill, security and freedom that prevails in the State. “May Sikkim be kept from destruction, unrest and hatred from racial, communal and religious differences,” Mr. Chamling said in his message on New Year’s Eve.|0|
Gujarat BJP chief tells Mistry to ‘live in Pak.’|Gandhinagar|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Gujarat BJP chief Jitu Vaghani on Monday asked senior Congress leader Madhusudan Mistry to “go and live” in Pakistan after the latter suggested that the India-Pakistan border at Suigam village in the State be opened to enable farmers to export their produce to the neighbouring country. Hitting back, the Congress asked Mr. Vaghani to first explain why the BJP government at the Centre is “going soft” on Pakistan. “Madhusudanbhai should go to Pakistan and live there,” said Mr. Vaghani when asked to comment on the Congress leader’s suggestion, which he had shared during a party rally held near Himmatnagar town in Sabarkantha district on December 29. For farmers’ benefit At that programme, the Rajya Sabha MP from Gujarat had said that opening of the Indo-Pak. border at Suigam village in Banaskantha district would benefit farmers of three northern districts in the State. “During my visit to Idar town some years ago, local farmers complained that their produce of tomatoes takes three days to reach the Wagah border [in Punjab] and lie there for another two days before reaching Pakistan. As a result, the farmers are not getting the desired price for the produce,” Mr. Mistry had said. Mr. Mistry further said he had told farmers in the past that the BJP government lacked vision. Responding to Mr. Vaghani’s barb at Mr. Mistry, Gujarat Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi said the BJP leader should first clear his party’s stand on the “invitation extended by the Gujarat government to Pakistan for the upcoming Vibrant Gujarat Summit”. After the invitation was extended to Pakistan, office-bearers of the Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry had claimed that it was only a “general circular” meant for around 285 global trade bodies, and the final invitation will be sent only after scrutiny.|0|
Farming resumes on dry areas of reservoir water spread|Salem|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Farmers of the villages surrounding Mettur have commenced the farm operations in the dry water spread area of the Stanley Reservoir with the water level in the dam going down due to the poor inflow for the past many days. The farmers of Pannavadi, Sethukuli, Kottaiyur and Moolakkadu villages raise crops such as sesame seeds, cholam, kambu, groundnut, cotton, tobacco, bhendi and raddish in the dry water spread area of the dam, whenever the water level went down. The realisation of water in River Cauvery at Mettur was below 1,000 cusecs mark since December 22, following which the water level was going down. The farmers of Perumalkoil and Natham villages near Kolathur have already raised groundnut in the dry water spread area. These farmers complain that wild boars from the nearby reserve forests enter the fields during the night and damage the crop. The farmers have made special arrangements by setting up ‘paran’ (temporary stage) and burst crackers to drive away the boars. A cross section of the farmers have urged the Forest Department to take steps to prevent the entry of boars from the reserve forests in to the fields.|0|

Reader’s Mail (Dindigul)|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST| To facilitate introduction of more trains in the Madurai-Rameswaram section, the Southern Railway has proposed to electrify the track between these two important stations. Unfortunately, it is now reported that a survey has been ordered only up to Manamadurai from Madurai Junction. If the track is upgraded as as electrified track only half way, it will defeat the very purpose of this project since no one can ignore the importance of Rameswaram and thousands of pilgrims visiting the Sri Ramanathaswamy Temple. I appeal to the Union Railway Minister and General Manager, Southern Railway, to complete electrification between Madurai and Rameswaram as a single project for the convenience of public. The construction of a new railway bridge at Pamban has also become the need of the hour.  Asmabagh Anvardeen, Ramanathapuram.|0|
Over 5,000 UDID cards issued in Tiruchi district|TIRUCHI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The office of the District Differently Abled Welfare Officer has issued over 5,000 Unique Disability Identity (UDID) cards in Tiruchi district since 2016. About 17,500 out of 60,150 persons with disabilities had registered online for UDID cards, which obviate the need for them to carry multiple copies of documents. The card captures details that can be decoded with the help of a reader, and will serve as a single document for identification and verification for providing various benefits in future, District Differently Abled Welfare Officer R. Ravichandran said. For the government, the UDID card will help in streamlining the tracking of the physical and financial progress of the beneficiary from village to national levels. Initiated by the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities, the UDID project aims at building a holistic end-to-end integrated system for Issuance of Universal ID & Disability Certificates for Person with Disabilities with their identification and disability details. The process of UDID registration will be expedited henceforth through involvement of anganwadi workers. A pilot project is in progress in a few blocks for spot registration with tablets provided to anganwadi workers, according to officials. After registration, the people with disabilities become eligible to apply online for a disability certificate and UDID card. They will also be able to track the status of their application. The specified medical authorities issue the disability certificate/UDID Card electronically, after referring the applicants to a designated specialist or medical board for assessment. The UDID is delivered by post to the beneficiaries at the address mentioned by them during online registration. The expanded list of 21 disabilities for which the UDID card can be obtained constitute blindness, low-vision, leprosy-cured persons, hearing impairment (deaf and hard of hearing), locomotor disability, dwarfism, intellectual disability, mental illness, autism spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, chronic neurological conditions, specific learning disabilities, multiple sclerosis, speech and language disability, thalassemia, haemophilia, sickle cell disease, multiple disabilities including deaf blindness, acid attack victim, and Parkinsons disease, Mr. Ravichandran said.|0|
Shun plastic bags to save environment: Minister|Virudhunagar|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|An awareness programme for creating a plastic-free environment on the eve of single-use plastic ban was held here on Monday. Hundreds of employees of municipalities, panchayat unions and town panchayats, anganwadis, and members of public participated in the programme. After a rally to highlight the use of cloth bags and paper covers instead of single-use plastic bags was taken out, Minister for Dairy Development, K. T. Rajenthra Bhalaji, administered a pledge to the participants. The Minister said that people of Virudhunagar district should cooperate with the Government in banning single-use plastic by using alternatives like cloth bags and paper covers. The Government has banned plastic as it caused environmental degradation. The programme was also meant to create awareness on the evils of spurious liquor and to make Virudhunagar district an open-defecation free district. The Minister said that consuming liquor and arrack would ruin the health, make the addicts lose their memory power and eye sight. It also leads to infertility and loss of respect in society. “The education of children in the families of addicts is affected and the family is trapped in poverty”, he said. The Minister also inspected an exhibition put up by the Department of Health, Department of Food Safety and Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board. The Minister distributed cloth bags to the people on the occasion. Virudhunagar Collector, A. Sivagnanam, Srivilliputtur MLA, M. Chandra Prabha, District Superintendent of Police, M.

Engineering ancillaries in Tiruchi in dire straits, look for RBI rescue|TIRUCHI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|At least 60 engineering ancillaries of BHEL in Tiruchi district are on the verge of closure as banks are in the process of enforcing SARFAESI (Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securities Interest) Act. Due to slackness in orders from power utilities over the last few years, and domination by Chinese power equipment manufacturers, operations of about 25 local industries, including three major manufacturers, Cethar Vessels, GB Industries, and Veesons Energy Systems Pvt. Ltd., came to a halt. The immovable properties of the industries have been classified by the banks as non-performing assets. The dismal state of the boiler sector that has reflected in the closure of the ancillary industries has rendered several thousands of workers jobless, proprietors lament. Unlike a decade ago, when BHEL used to have a smooth sail, having to stave off competition only from local contenders and could retain two-thirds market share, the maharatna company faced a setback in securing orders in recent years due to the tough competition posed by Chinese companies. Buoyed by BHEL’s ambitious forecast of capacity addition during 2010-11, many of the engineering ancillaries scaled up their capacities by raising huge bank loans. But when the order position of BHEL took a hit in later years due to aggressive strategies adopted by the Chinese power majors, the immediate impact was felt on the ancillaries that could not secure the conversion orders to even sustain their operations, leave alone debt-servicing, according to an industrialist who has shut down his unit. The silver lining has been the string of recent orders secured by BHEL over the last year based on which the engineering ancillaries are hoping to bounce back. At this juncture, what the harried industrialists look for is a moratorium on loans and fresh infusion of capital. A delegation of Tamil Nadu Boilers Association has approached the Department of Financial Services with thehope that Reserve Bank of India will prevail upon the lenders, the nationalised banks, to put on hold confiscation of immovable properties of the companies that had defaulted on repayments. “We have received positive indications,” TNBA treasurer Rajappa Rajkumar said. “Intervention by RBI in the prevailing situation is crucial for revival of hundreds of engineering ancillaries in Tiruchi that are otherwise staring at closure,” he noted.

Farmers stage protest|SALEM|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Farmers who had given their lands for the four-laning of the Salem - Ulundurpettai national highway staged an agitation in front of the Collectorate here on Monday demanding hike in compensation. The agitation was held under the banner Tamil Nadu Vivasaya Sangangalin Koottu Iyakkam. The protesting farmers said that their farmlands situated in Vazhappadi, Thalaivasal, Attur, Sinna Salem, Kallakurichi, Thiyagadurugam were acquired for the four-laning project a few years ago and were given a meagre compensation. The farmers then moved the court, which ordered provision of increased compensation. They said that the Salem district administration sanctioned hiked compensation as per the court order only to a very few people and was adopting delaying tactics in the case of a large number of farmers. The farmers have been demanding increased compensation for many years and had also launched various agitations to draw the attention of the government to their demand. R. Gopalakrishnan, state treasurer of the Iyakkam, led the agitation. Sellamuthu, state president of the Uzhavar-Uzhaippalar Katchi, Ethapur S. Jayaraman, state secretary of the Iyakkam, and others participated.|0|

Kottapattu fails location test for new bus stand|TIRUCHI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Tiruchi Corporation, which mooted a proposal for an integrated bus stand at Kottapattu on Pudukottai Road, has decided to keep it in abeyance mainly due to unsuitability of the location on various parameters. A number of sites, including Devadhanam off Tiruchi-Chennai Bypass Road, Ramji Nagar on Tiruchi-Dindigul Road, Panchapur on Tiruchi-Madurai Highway and Kottapattu on Tiruchi-Pudukottai National Highway, were considered since early 1990s. Of them, the 90 acres of land adjacent to Tiruchi Central Prison was favoured by the previous AIADMK government. Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, while speaking at the MGR centenary celebration in Tiruchi in October 2017, announced that the new bus stand would come up soon. Following this, Tiruchi Corporation began the process of finalising a detailed project report. However, according to sources, the proposal was shelved due to poor scope for future expansion and commercial development around the proposed site at Kottapattu. “The proposed site is landlocked between the airport and prison. Moreover, we need private landholdings around the bus stand so that commercial activities can flourish. But there are not many private landholdings adjacent to the proposed site. There is no point in establishing a bus stand without the scope of future development,” a senior official, who was involved in the process, toldThe Hindu. Another official said that any bus stand should be on a national highway. As far as Kottapattu site was concerned, it was located behind the Central Prison. Buses had to branch off from Tiruchi-Pudukottai highway, which would cause enormous traffic snarls. It was not a convenient location in terms of clear accessibility. Moreover, many residents were not in favour of Kottapattu. Hence, it had been decided to keep the proposal in abeyance. When contacted, N. Ravichandran, Commissioner, Tiruchi Corporation, toldThe Hinduthat the civic body was exploring various options on establishing a new bus stand. One of them was to set up a bus port on a national highway on the outskirts of Tiruchi. A formal communication had been sent to the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) to set up bus port along with the proposed bus ports in Salem, Coimbatore and Madurai. Senior NHAI officials would be apprised in person shortly on the need to establish the bus port. Depending upon the outcome of the meeting, further action would be taken on the issue.  We are exploring all options, including setting up a bus port on a NH on the outskirts N. RavichandranCommissioner, Tiruchi Corporation,|0|

Farmers in Jawadhu Hills encouraged to grow litchi, custard apples|TIRUVANNAMALAI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|In a bid to improve the livelihood of farmers in Jawadhu Hills, the district administration launched the cultivation of litchi and two varieties of custard apples in Palamarathur village of Jawadhu Hills union last week. This year, a total of 400 farmers have been selected for cultivating the crops. Collector K.S. Kandasamy launched the cultivation work that would be carried out by the departments of Horticulture and Rural Development and Panchayat Raj through Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act scheme at a cost of Rs. 11.98 lakh. A total of 11,200 saplings of litchi and custard apples would be planted. This included 8,000 saplings of litchi. Under this scheme, each farmer would get 20 litchi saplings and four saplings of each variety of custard apples, according to a press release. Augmenting income This was part of efforts of the district administration to enable tribals living in Jawadhu Hills to double their income. Officials of the Department of Horticulture said both litchi and custard apples were high-value crops.  “We went to the ICAR-National Research Centre on litchi in Muzaffarpur, Bihar and studied the cultivation of litchi. Twenty farmers from Jamunamarathur also visited the centre. They provided the farmers with saplings that were planted and has grown well in the last three months. The climate is conducive to its growth,” an official said. This year, 400 farmers were selected for the scheme. By July 2019, another 2,600 farmers would be selected, he said, adding, “We will be covering 500 acres under this scheme.” He added that a kilo of litchi was sold at Rs. 400 or move, while that of custard apples was Rs. 150-Rs. 200. This would help the farmers to get better revenue, he said.|0|
NGT orders clean-up of dump yard in Udhagamandalam|UDHAGAMANDALAM|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has ordered the clean-up of a dump yard in Theetukkal, bringing relief to residents and conservationists. According to officials, the dump yard, spread over 20 acres, was being used by the Udhagamandalam Municipality since 1972 for the dumping of waste generated in the town limits. The land was leased from the Forest Department. The lease period expired in 2012, and it had not been renewed since. Over the years, a total of 1.34 lakh metric tonnes of waste had accumulated in the dump yard, officials said. Around 30 houses are situated close by, and a number of species of wildlife, including birds, leopards and herbivores are commonly spotted around the yard, causing concern among conservationists and wildlife enthusiasts about the effect the garbage could have on the health of local residents and wildlife. In an order in November, the NGT had asked the Udhagamandalam Municipality to stop the dumping of waste at the dump yard and take remedial measures to remove the more than 1.34 lakh tonnes of waste dumped there since 1972. It also directed the municipality to formulate an action plan to deal with waste in the future.  Micro-composting units Speaking toThe Hindu, The Nilgiris Collector, Innocent Divya, said the issue was ‘workable’. The district administration had already set up two micro-composting units in Khandal and four more were in the works. “We will also begin bio-mining at the dump yard and initiate the clean-up of the yard belonging to the Forest Department and hand it over,” Ms. Divya said.|0|

Man demands details of treatment given to wife at GH|Salem|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The husband of the 28-year-old woman of Kudhiraikaran Pudhur village near Mettur, who is undergoing treatment after testing positive for HIV, has urged the district administration to provide the details of the treatment provided to his wife at the Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College Hospital (GMKMCH) in the city in 2014. The woman had alleged that she contracted HIV following a blood transfusion during her first pregnancy at the Mechery Primary Health Centre four years ago. The Health Department had denied the allegation stating that all the available records proved that the blood transfused to the woman did not have HIV infection.  However, the woman’s husband, a lorry driver, presented a petition to District Collector on Monday stating that his wife was admitted to GMKMCH for delivery and she was in the hospital from August 11 to 28. During this period, a unit of blood was transfused to her. The Health Department officials have not furnished any details of this blood transfusion while refuting the allegation of his wife. He said that the failure of the Health Department officials to mention about the blood transfusion at the GMKMCH was giving room for the doubt that the official machinery was hiding the facts. He also took exception to the statement of the officials that his wife had contracted HIV infection due to “other reasons”, which he said had caused mental agony to his wife, the petition said. He has also sought the copies of case sheets, issue register, master records prepared when his wife underwent treatment at GMKMCH, through Right to Information Act.|0|
MoU on Rs. 650-cr. investment in MSME sector|TIRUCHI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Global Investors Meet 2019 Road Show in Tiruchi on Monday witnessed assurances from entrepreneurs for investment of Rs. 650 crore in MSME sector in the district. The agreements for investment were made in the presence of Ministers ‘Vellamandi’ N. Natarajan and S. Valarmathi. Explaining the advantages of Single Window Facilitation for MSMEs, Mr. Natarajan said the government was keen on improving the ease of doing business in Tamil Nadu. State public undertakings were fostering MSMEs through procuring 25% of their requirements from the latter. Opportunities for investment in the sector were numerous owing to the presence of BHEL, Golden Rock Workshop and Ordnance Factory. Units in SIDCO industrial estates had scope for securing outsourcing orders from these industries. The opportunities in textile-related activities, IT, and manufacture of fly-ash bricks and m-sand must be explored further, he said. The Minister was hopeful of growth in export of processed vegetables, cut flowers and other products through the international airport in Tiruchi. Ms. Valarmathi said 20% of the 1,000-acre SIPCOT industrial park to come up at Mondipatti near Manapparai would be allotted for MSMEs. Collector K. Rajamani presided over the meet. General Manager of District Industries Centre M. Chidambaram; Branch Manager of SIDCO M. Anitha; Branch Manager of Tamil Nadu Industrial Investment Corporation S. Ravindran; Lead Bank Manager (IOB) K. Govindan; president of CII Tiruchi Zone A.S Ananthakrishnan; and MPs and MLAs took part.|0|
Entire Purple Line expected to be open by today afternoon|Bengaluru|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|"The BMRCL, on Monday, said regular services on the entire Purple Line will be restored by the afternoon of January 1 ‘in all probability’. This will cause inconvenience to office-goers in the morning peak hours as close to 19,000 people travel in the metro on the Purple Line every hour during peak hours. Services between M.G. Road and Indiranagar metro stations were stopped from 8 p.m on December 28 to rectify a 'honeycomb formation' (concrete distress) in a beam on a pillar near Trinity station. Initially, the BMRCL had set December 31 as the deadline to resume services before the date was pushed back to January 1. A BMRCL press release stated that to inspect the bearing location concrete, the entire super structure had to be lifted. “After inspection, all the concrete areas requiring attention were identified. Bearing locations and jacking locations were strengthened with steel plates as a permanent solution. Other concrete areas were grouted. The effectiveness of the attention given is being verified through non-destructive testing, instrumentation and trials by trains at different speeds,” the release said. Deputy Chief Minister G. Parameshwara visited the maintenance work site and instructed the BMRCL to carry out complete quality audit of the entire Phase I network of 42 km. Many passengers learnt about the postponement to January 1 only after they reached the stations, and had to rely on the shuttle bus services to reach Baiyappanahalli. Arjun Singh, a private company employee, said, ""The change in the plan by the BMRCL was unexpected. I boarded the metro assuming that the entire Purple Line is operational. Delay in resumption of services forced people to spend more time in traffic to reach their workplace.” Smriti Mishra, an IT professional, said, ""Repeated change in the stand taken by the BMRCL is not fair. The BMRCL had announced earlier that everything will be back on track on December 31 morning, but that did not happen.” Vananda, another office-goer, said, “The only good thing about BMRCL is they have provided a free bus shuttle service between Cubbon Park station and Baiyappanahalli. Or else, everyone had to rely on autorickshaws or taxis to reach their workplace."" Senior citizens and families too had a tough time as they were forced to hop on and off the train to reach their destination. (Inputs by Rahna V.N.)"|0|

Devotees steadily pour in, but rush less than expected at Tirumala|TIRUPATI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Devotees are slowly and steadily pouring into the temple city for a darshan of Lord Venkateswara at Tirumala but the trend of thin crowd similar to the last three years continued. The stretch between Dec 15 and Jan 15 is always considered ‘peak season’, with the auspicious ‘Dhanurmasam’ running concurrent, along with Vaikuntha Ekadasi, the English New Year and the Sankranti. Many Ayyappa devotees returning from Sabarimala make it a point to visit Tirumala on their way back home. Though the city should resemble a ‘sea of humanity’ by now, it was not so on Monday as only moderate crowd was witnessed in Tirupati and the Renigunta railway stations, the central bus station, the private bus stand for the Tamil Nadu services, the ‘Srinivasam’ and the ‘Vishnu Nivasam’ accommodation complexes. Anticipating huge rush, the TTD had cancelled all Arjitha (paid) sevas and privilege darshan for January 1 and limited the ‘break’ darshan to protocol VIPs. The darshan slot for pedestrians, physically challenged and senior citizens was also withdrawn. Even the VIPs have not turned out in expected numbers. While the VIP darshan was scheduled to begin at 2 am on Tuesday, the darshan for common pilgrims was fixed for 4.30 am.|0|

Tiruvarur goes to poll under Gaja’s shadow|TIRUCHI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Cyclone Gaja, which destroyed the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of people in the delta and neighbouring districts, is bound to cast a long shadow over the byelection to the largely agrarian Tiruvarur constituency. The cyclone’s impact, and the government’s response to it, will be key poll issues as the byelection comes at a time when relief, restoration and rehabilitation efforts are still under way. Sporadic agitations by the affected communities over the pace of relief and restoration efforts are still being reported in the district. Tiruvarur district witnessed a spate of agitations in the aftermath of the cyclone, and this, some officials and Ministers felt, affected relief and restoration work. The cyclone had caused extensive damage in Thiruthuraipoondi, Muthupet and Kottur blocks in the district as well as in parts of Tiruvarur and Mannargudi blocks. With the model code of conduct coming into effect in the district, a section of farmer-leaders feared that the ongoing relief and restoration work may suffer on account of the bypoll. Peak agricultural season “Relief and restoration work has not been completed yet. Power supply has not been restored fully in some interior villages. The byelection process may impact this work. It would have been better if the Election Commission had announced the byelection after the relief and restoration work was completed,” said Mannargudi S. Ranganathan, general secretary, Cauvery Delta Farmers Welfare Association. This is also the peak agriculture season, with the samba paddy harvest expected to commence in most parts of the district in the next couple of weeks, he pointed out. But others hoped that the byelection would spur the government into expediting the relief operations. “We hope that the government would speed up the relief and rehabilitation process in the affected areas as the cyclone is expected to be a major election issue,” observed P.R. Pandian, president, Coordination Committee of All Tamil Nadu Farmers Associations. An official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that the implementation of relief measures would not be affected as the process was already under way. “We don’t think it will affect this process. If necessary, we will seek clarification (from the Election Commission),” the officer said. However, he conceded that rehabilitation projects may be affected.|0|

Reader’s Mail (Madurai)|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST| The Railway Ministry has introduced Antyodaya Express trains to cater to the needs of common people. These trains essentially carry second class unreserved coaches only. It is expected that an Antyodaya service should provide a cheaper journey to the ‘targeted people’ and, in any case, not more than the normal fare, leave alone any concession. But, ironically, the fare is far steeper with an increase ranging from 25% to 38% over normal express travel. For instance, while an express train fare is Rs. 160 from Madurai to Tambaram on the main line the Antyodaya train traverses, it is Rs. 200 in Antyodaya Express. The fare is Rs. 90 from Madurai to Tirunelveli as against normal express fare of Rs. 65. The Antyodaya Express running between Tambaram and Tirunelveli has only 11 stoppages as a result of which travellers en route are barred from using the service at important places like Sattur, Kovilpatti, Sirkali, Chidambaram and Cuddalore. The railway administration would do well to undertake a review of the twin aspects of fare reduction and increased stoppages in the larger interest of travellers. M. Kamala Palamedu Road   It is heartening to note that the Highways department will widen and improve the road connecting Melur Road and AIR transmitter junction on Alanganallur Road, through Surveyor Colony, Iyer Bungalow, Kulamangalam Road and Anaiyur. (’An alternative link to Dindigul Road taking shape,’ Dec. 17, 2018). The Alanganallur Road stretch between AIR transmitter junction and old Alamaram Junction through Koodal Nagar over bridge is already riddled with heavy vehicular traffic during day time. The new link road will worsen the traffic condition on this stretch. The stretch between AIR junction and Koodal Nagar over bridge also needs to be widened as a four-lane road, with a median. It should have zebra crossings with signals at two spots. Improving the stretch . Will the Highways department take suitable action? V. Thiruvengadanathan Railar Nagar   I am surprised to see good projects like abolition of begging and rehabilitation of those seeking alms being started with a bang but disappearing with a whimper. The previous Collector K. Veeraraghava Rao began this project. The present administration is requested to continue this noble work. Begging should be made a thing of the past by introducing welfare schemes on a large scale by government and non-government organisations. M. Vathapureeswaran Tirunagar   It is quite unfortunate that Madurai Corporation has taken away the paper cups used in hotels meant for serving coffee, tea and milk. There paper cubs, when burnt, completely turn into ash. Considering the hygienic aspect also, the State government should lift the ban on these paper cups. Glass tumblers are not hygienic. Even total ban on plastics is not advisable as it is not practicable. Can the government ban polythene bags for Aavin milk supply? Already many western countries have discovered ways to recycle plastic. A Professor of Chemistry of Thiagarajar Engineering College has succeeded in his attempts to lay plastic roads. It is a gratifying to know that Madurai Corporation Commission S. Aneesh Sekhar has said that the Corporation will lay roads utilising plastic waste. R. Selvaraj  Kuruvikkaran Salai   It is really a welcome sign that a majority of roadside vendors have started to use cloth bags. It is a remarkable change in traders’ mind. But buyers are not ready to change their mind to switch over from polythene bag to cloth bag. Buyers should always take cloth bags while going out for shopping. The district administration should be commended for its efforts to make Madurai plastic-free.  G. Chittibabu  Velmurugan Nagar|0|

The Nilgiris police decide to counsel drunk drivers|UDHAGAMANDALAM|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|As levying fines on drunk drivers on New Year’s eve every year is not reducing the number of such drivers on roads, the Nilgiris district police decided not to register cases against revellers this year. Instead, they decided to provide an all-night counselling to revellers on the dangers of alcoholism. District Superintendent of Police D. Shanmuga Priya said temporary shelters were set up at 17 locations across the district for the counselling. “We have trained police personnel to talk to youths as well as others indulging in such reckless driving,” she told reporters.

T.N. resident robbed of Rs. 1 lakh|Hassan|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|A group of four people, including a woman, allegedly robbed a person from Tamil Nadu of Rs. 1.07 lakh in the first week of December. The incident came to the notice of Arsikere police on Sunday when the victim, Naveen Kumar, filed a complaint. Naveen, a resident of Hosur taluk in Tamil Nadu, had developed friendship with a woman, Arpitha. She came with him on a bike to Hassan and went around the place on December 3. As they were reaching Arsikere, a car stopped them. Pavan, Kiran and Dore, who were in the car, forcibly took Naveen Kumar into their car and attacked him with a knife. They took away his watch, a chain and cash of Rs. 7,000. Later, they took him to a secluded place and made him call up his family members.

‘Withdraw Transgenders Bill, table it again with changes’|HUBBALLI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Seeking immediate steps to withdraw the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2018 and table it again with appropriate amendments, members of the Transgenders community took out a protest march in Hubblali on Monday. Beginning from the Ambedkar’s statue near the Head Post Office, the protestors marched to Kittur Chennamma Circle raising slogans to highlight their demands. They said that the Bill as passed by Lok Sabha on December 17, 2018, claimed to provide for protection of rights of transgenders and their welfare. However, instead of addressing the daily oppressions and indignities faced by the transgenders, the Bill would adversely affect them and would rather further institutionalise violations, they said. The protestors said that while the new definition of the word transgender was a welcome move in the new Bill, there were several points that were against the community and provided solid grounds for withdrawal of the Bill. They said that the recommendations of the standing committee of Parliament and comments and suggestions of the transgenders had been completely neglected. Also, the Bill violated the right to equality and other fundamental rights of transgenders community, they said. They said that considering various aspects they would urge all members of Parliament to suitably review the 2018 Bill and modify it based on the comments and suggestions submitted by transgenders to the parliamentary standing committee and table the Bill again. They said that they would also urge the Chairman of Rajya Sabha to refer the Human Trafficking Bill to the Select Committee. A memorandum was submitted to the taluk administration subsequently. The agitation was held under the aegis of National Network of Sex Workers, Samar Society and Sangama of Bengaluru.|0|

BBMP declares all wards as ‘Open Defecation Free’|Bengaluru|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has issued a public notice declaring areas under its jurisdiction as ‘Open Defecation Free’. The notice has been issued after approval from the BBMP council recently. BBMP's Special Commissioner (Solid Waste Management) D. Randeep toldThe Hinduthat until now, none of the 198 wards in the city had been declared free of open defecation. “We have just initiated the process. Once we receive objections, we will go to the field to check where the gaps exist, where the nearest public toilet is, whether the applications for household toilets have been processed.,” he said. It is only after this initial process is completed that the BBMP can apply for certification from the Quality Control of India, which will submit its report to the Centre. Just initiating the process of declaring the 198 wards as being Open Defecation Free (ODF) will earn 25 points under the Swachh Bharat Mission. In 2016, the city scored a zero in the category, as no part of the city was declared open defecation free. In 2017, the BBMP was able to declare 109 wards as ODF. As per the Swachh Bharat Mission standard for cities with a floating population of more than five lakh, there should be one toilet seat for every 100 men and two toilet seats for every 100 women. According to a survey by the Janaagraha Centre for Citizenship and Democracy, nearly 85% of all public toilets are in the core city areas. The study also showed that the city needs at least 1,100 public toilet complexes. The BBMP has already found gaps in a few wards in the outer zones. Mr. Randeep said there is a need for more public toilets in Mahadevapura and Bellandur wards, which are large in terms of area. “The city has a total of 613 toilets (public and community). Around 40 will be constructed over the next couple of months,” he said. Sources in the BBMP said according to the Swachh Bharat Mission criteria, the civic body can issue a public notice only after approval from the council. The BBMP has now invited objections from the public. Objections may be submitted till January 14, 2019. Citizens can submit their objections to the Joint Commissioner (Solid Waste Management), 2nd Floor, Annexe Building 02, Central Office, N.R. Square, Bengaluru 560002, [email protected]|0|

Task force to study coffee growers’ problems|Hassan|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Commerce Ministry has decided to constitute a task force to study the problems faced by coffee growers, said representatives of Karnataka Growers’ Federation, here on Monday. At a press conference, B.S. Jairam, president of the organisation, which represents coffee growers of Hassan, Chikkamagaluru and Kodagu districts, said Union Commerce Minister Suresh Prabhu gave a direction for setting up of the task force at a meeting held in Delhi on December 26. Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy had taken a delegation to the Commerce Minister to discuss the problems faced by coffee growers. Former Prime Minister and Lok Sabha member H.D. Deve Gowda, PWD Minister H.D. Revanna and others from the State were part of the delegation which met the Union Minister and briefed him about the problems. “The Minister has said the task force will be headed by the Chief Secretary of the State and it would include representatives from the Union Ministry. Based on the recommendation of the task force the Central government will take further steps”, Mr. Jairam said. The delegation had demanded a special package for the coffee growers, who suffered huge loss due to devastating rains that lashed the three coffee growing areas earlier. “The growers have lost their estates. The farmers, who were already at loss due fall in the price of coffee in the market, suffered a severe jolt due to the heavy rains”, he said. B.A.Jagannath, JD(S) leader, said the Central government had decided to keep a tab on the import of pepper, by fixing the minimum price at Rs. 500 per kg. “Earlier low-quality pepper was imported, causing a sudden fall in price. The price had come down to Rs. 320 per kg against Rs. 750 per kg. When the production cost itself was Rs. 500 per kg, we were selling it at a loss”, he said.

Look at parking issue first, wedding later: traffic police|Bengaluru|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Those travelling on the busy Sankey Road during marriage season will know that traffic clogs up for a fair distance when multiple weddings are conducted in the numerous halls of Palace Grounds. The scenario is repeated in front of nearly every marriage hall where parked vehicles often take up most of the road. The traffic police believe this to be a major contributor to congestion in the city. They surveyed over 1,500 marriage halls, and when they host weddings, more than 40% of the neighbouring roads are occupied by vehicles of the attendees. “For big weddings, there can be a minimum of 300 vehicles which are parked in and around marriage halls leading to traffic chaos,” says P. Harishekaran, Additional Commissioner of Police (Traffic). This translates to congestion in up to a 1-km radius of the hall, said officials. Traffic police mentioned Rajajinaar, roads around Palace Grounds, Magadi Road, Bengaluru central and south as the problem areas.  Revise BBMP guidelines They found that more than 95% of the wedding halls had converted their basements, which should be used for parking, into dining halls. “As a result, vehicles are forced to park on the roads occupying public space and creating nuisance to road users,” said Mr. Harishekaran, who held a meeting with the management of a few marriage halls to chalk out a solution. During the meeting, traffic police directed the owners to ensure that the designated parking places are cleared. Moreover, if parking cannot be arranged within the complex, then they should make use of designated private parking areas to ensure that visitor vehicles do not spill over on to the road, the police said. The larger problem, however, were the regulations of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). Current legislation for marriage halls is to ensure that one parking space is allotted for every 50 visitors. That is, for a wedding of 1,000 people, only 20 parking spaces need to be allotted. However, traffic police believe that nowadays a majority of the attendees come by vehicles. “We will write to the BBMP to update and revise their guidelines to current traffic patterns,” said Mr. Harishekaran. The BBMP, on the other hand, is now preparing a plan of action for removal of footpath encroachment. Part of the plan is to ensure that the basement is used for the purpose allowed in the sanctioned building plan. The drive will begin across all the eight zones in the city in January 2019.|0|
2019 gets a boisterous welcome|Bengaluru|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|New Year celebrations reached a feverish pitch at the stroke of midnight. Thousands of revellers, who had gathered in the central business district, burst into jubilation. They burst crackers while cries of Happy New Year rent the air. They also posed for selfies and burst into song and dance. The police had tightened security in the CBD area and many roads in Koramangala and Indiranagar where revellers were expected to ring in the New Year. Drone cameras, CCTV and giant screens were deployed to keep a close watch over the revellers. The police personnel did not allow revellers to consume liquor in public. They were seen checking people entering Brigade Road from Cauvery Junction. Several liquor bottles were seized. According to senior police officials, nearly 12,000 police personnel were deputed to maintain law and order. This is apart from 1,500 home guards and 1,000 civil defence personnel. The police had earlier announced that New Year celebrations will not be allowed beyond 2 a.m. They had also banned movement of vehicles on flyovers in the city till 6 a.m. on Tuesday.  Massive crowd With crowds swelling in the CBD area, police had to resort to mild caning on a few occasions. Repeated announcements were also being by the police, asking revellers to keep moving. Overall, no untoward incidents were reported. Families that had arrived in CBD areas were escorted to safe areas by police personnel. Earlier in the day, Home Minister M.B. Patil, accompanied by Director General and Inspector General of Police Neelamani Raju, inspected the security arrangements that had been put in place.  Drunken driving The traffic police had a solution to keep boisterous and inebriated revellers off the roads. They had booked as many as eight marriage halls across the city to detain those caught for drunken driving until their hangover comes down. The traffic police were instructed to seize vehicles and detain the offenders in the nearest marriage halls where they were to remain until 6 a.m. On Monday. P. Harishekaran, Additional Commissioner of Police (Traffic), said that these offenders would also be levied a fine. Around 2,000 traffic policemen were deployed at strategic locations for the special drive. They were also instructed to patrol highways, arterial roads and the NICE Road. “We are doing this to ensure safety of motorists and their family members,” he added.|0|

Dharma sansad of seers in January last week: Pejawar seer|Vijayapura|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Vishwesha Tirtha Swami of Pejawar Mutt in Udupi has said a dharma sansad of seers of different mutts will be convened during Kumbha Mela at Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh in the last week of January. This will be to discuss the next move to pressure the Union government to built a Ram Temple in Ayodhya, Addressing presspersons on the sidelines of Bharata Samskriti Utsav on Monday, he said that a detailed discussion will be held to formulate a strategy in this regard. When he was reminded that several Union Ministers have already made it clear that the government would wait for a Supreme Court order instead of bringing an ordinance to construct the temple, the seer claimed that according to several legal experts, an ordinance could be brought even when the matter is sub judice. “However, during our meeting we will also discuss on taking legal views and will also plan to talk to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the legal hurdles in bringing an ordinance,” he said. Claiming that Hindus are losing patience owing to delay in getting temple constructed, he said the government should not delay it any further. When asked why the matter was being raised now, the seer said it was the right time to pressure on the government as the BJP does not want to lose public support. Replying to a question why he does not wish to take lead in resolving the dispute amicably by taking Muslim leaders into confidence, he said that it would be right if the government takes such lead. The seer also expressed displeasure over the functioning of both the Union government and the the State Government. When he was asked about his views on law and order problems in Uttar Pradesh, he downplayed it and said it was the same situation in Karnataka. “Controlling law and order in the job of the government and it should do its job,” he said.|0|

Digitally signed crop loan waiver certificates|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|As the State and Union governments spar over the implementation of farm loan waiver in Karnataka, Chief Minister H. D. Kumaraswamy on Monday announced that digitally signed crop loan waiver certificates have been made available to farmers online. “The sample list of ration cards is shared with you so that you can see for yourself how a farmer can see his own waiver payment certificate and also print it,” he tweeted.

The Chief Minister had on Sunday responded saying it demeaned the efforts of the State.|0|
Reader’s Mail (Tirunelveli)|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|  Traffic signals installed at a few places in Palayamkottai -- on the North High Ground Road, near Central Library and Siddha Medical College Hospital -- are not functioning despite the fact that there is heavy traffic congestion at these junctions. I request the traffic police officials to take immediate action to make all non-functional signals operative. P. Victor Selvaraj, Palayamkottai.   It is saddening to read that six lives were snatched away in an accident involving a van and a bus near Kayathar last week. Of late, highway accidents are happening between Gangaikondan and Kayathar frequently. The National Highways Authorities of India should undertake a detailed study , analyse the causes and come out with solutions to stop recurrence of such unfortunate accidents. A.M.N. Pandian,  Tirunelveli.   The recently opened flyovers at Marthandam and Parvathipuram offer a great relief for travellers in Kanniyakumari district, especially during the Christmas season. Minister of State for Shipping and Finance Pon. Radhakrishnan deserves all appreciation for completing the work in record time. Though the purpose of the flyovers is to decongest traffic, it is made complicated at Nagercoil near Vettoornimadam. Instead of allowing the vehicles to go straight to Vadasery through the College Road, buses are directed through Christu Nagar Road, the busy Collector’s Office junction and the narrow Palace Road (Duthie School Road), causing congestion. Hence the district authorities are requested to make necessary alteration in the bus route and ensure safety to residents. G. Stanley Jeyasingh, Nagercoil.|0|
Law Minister seeks independent probe into Jaya’s death|VILLUPURAM|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Law Minister C.Ve. Shanmugam has called for an independent investigation into the cause of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s death. Speaking to reporters here on Monday, Mr. Shanmugam said nobody was permitted to see her during her hospitalisation for 75 days. He demanded that a case be registered under Section 174 of the CrPC and wanted all those responsible for Jayalalithaa’s ‘sufferings’ to be taken into police custody. He said it was highly suspicious that Rs. 1.17 crore was spent on the dietary requirements of Jayalalithaa. “Normally, when a patient is admitted to hospital, an attender would be permitted to stay with the patient. But in the case of the former Chief Minister, the entire hospital was converted into a guest house to accommodate members of one family,” he said.  The Law Minister wondered why the former Chief Minister was not taken abroad for treatment. He said it was wrong on the part of the former Chief Secretary, Rama Mohana Rao, to say that the Cabinet had decided not to take Jayalalithaa abroad for specialised treatment. “I am also a Minister, and no Cabinet meeting was held during the entire period of the former Chief Minister’s hospitalisation,” he said.|0|

Residents of Kavoor now fighting to revive sprawling 15-acre lake|MANGALURU|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Oswald D’Silva (50) still remembers his childhood days when he carried raw arecanut on coracle (Theppa) from his field on the one side of Kavoor Lake to his another field on the other side. He also has fond memories swimming in this vast lake. Mr. D’Silva is a member of the Kavoor Swachha Abhivrudhi Mandal which has been fighting for over five years now for the revival of the lake as it is filled with hyacinth. “We are taking up the issue with Deputy Commissioner Sasikanth Senthil S. We hope he will bring all stakeholders together and take steps to revive the lake,” he toldThe Hindu. The lake, which is among a few big water bodies in the city, is adjoining the old Mahalingeshwara Temple in Kavoor. The water from the lake was being used for rituals in the temple. A Pushkarni was constructed in a part of the lake where various rituals were being performed. This sprawling 15-acre lake is among the two maintained by Minor Irrigation Department. However, drains from Padavinangady, Mary Hill, Bondel and Kavoor, which once brought rainwater to the lake, now dump sewage into the lake, he regretted. Considerable silt is accumulated in the lake as the drains also bring animal and other waste. Leakage from sewer lines on the lake bound also adds sewage to the lake, he added. It was in 2011 that the State government took up the work of removing silt and beautifying it at a cost of Rs. 1 crore. The then district in-charge Minister Krishna J. Palemar initiated the work as part of a programme to develop lakes in the city. Except for laying embankment and building a mud path on the lake bund, there has been no improvements in the condition of the lake and its surroundings. The residents then sent a proposal to the Minor Irrigation Department for diversion of four drains and repair of leaking manholes at a cost of Rs. 5 crore. This was not accepted by the department. Kavoor area councillor Deepak Poojary said that the Mangalore Urban Development Authority has come forward to develop the lake if the Minor Irrigation Department raises no objections. The three leaking manholes will be repaired with funds from the Asian Development Bank, he said. An official from the Minor Irrigation Department said that the department was in favour of granting one-time permission to the urban development authority to develop the lake.

Kumbh Mela at T. Narsipur from February 17 to 19|Mysuru|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The 11th Kumbh Mela of T. Narsipur will be held from February 17 to 19 and the district administration has been directed to take up the necessary infrastructure works for the purpose. A tradition in making, the Kumbh Mela at T.Narsipur is the initiative of the seers and religious leaders of the region led by Shivpuri Swami of Kailash ashram and Shivaratri Deshikendra Swami of Suttur Mutt besides others and the first one was organised in 1989. It coincides with the Kumbh Mela held in turns at Prayag (Allabahad), Nashik, Haridwar and Ujjain. The seers here decided to organise a similar congregation of people at T. Narsipur as it is reckoned to be as sacred as the Triveni Sangama at Prayag, given the confluence of three rivers – Cauvery, Kapila and the Spatika Sarovara which is invisible in the popular perception of the devout. The objective is to provide an opportunity for the devotees in the region - who otherwise cannot go to north or central India - to participate in the religious congregation. The preliminary meeting for the 11th edition of Kumbh Mela was held on Monday in which Suttur seer, the pontiff of Adichunchanagiri Mutt, and representatives of Ramakrishna Ashram apprised the district in-charge Minister G.T. Deve Gowda of the event. The Minister said there would be no dearth of funds and all administrative support for shoring up infrastructure for the smooth conduct of the Kumbh Mela would be accorded by the government. In a follow-up meeting, the officials were directed to lay emphasis on providing drinking water facilities, toilets, health and sanitation, improvement to the approach roads leading to T. Narsipur and ensuring adequate power supply. Estimate The officials were directed to prepare an estimate for the works and submit the same by January 2, 2019 so that it could be forwarded to the government.|0|

‘Uncle’ takes a final bow|BENGALURU|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Veteran actor C.H. Loknath might have acted in over 600 films, but ardent cine-goers will remember him for his role as ‘Maacha’, the cobbler, who pleads to have a taste of Uppinakayi (pickle) inBhootayyana Maga Ayyu. His skilful portrayal of the role became such a rage that on one occasion a fan gifted him a ‘jaadi’ (porcelain jar) of pickle. This acting finesse was reflected in subsequent roles — as the principal of a college inNagarahavu,as ‘Thaatha’ (old man) inMinchina Ota,and as ‘Sadashivaiah’ inKaada Beladingalu,directed by B.S. Lingadevaru. Theatre buffs will not forget him in ‘Galileo’, directed by Prasanna for Samudaya. Through performances inTaayi,Ghosts,andOedipus, Loknath carved a niche for himself in the annals of Kannada theatre. Loknath studied engineering, and his entry into films was by sheer accident. He used to visit a gym of writer and playwright K.V. Iyer, but more than fitness, he learnt the nuances of acting there. He entered films throughSamskara,directed by Pattabhirama Reddy in 1970. He was soon sharing screen space with all the stalwarts of Kannada cinema and theatre, including Dr. Rajkumar, Shankar Nag, Anant Nag, Vishnuvardhan, M.H. Ambareesh, and Kamal Haasan. T. Venkateshamurthy, of Samudaya, Bengaluru, remembers him as “a committed artist, who attended all the rehearsals on time and made himself available for all the shows of his plays in spite of his busy film engagements”. Loknath was an integral part of both Kannada cinema and theatre for nearly three decades. After earning recognition as a character actor, he donned the role of father in many films and put up sterling performances inHosa Neeru, Bili Hendti, Bhagya Jyothi,andKatha Sangama. He was better known as “uncle” in both the theatre and cine world. However, apart from winning the Karnataka State Film Award for his performance inMinchina Otaas supporting actor, he did not get any other award in Kannada cinema. Born into an orthodox family which considered acting a taboo, Loknath overcame all obstacles to become an actor of high calibre. He remained hale and hearty till the very end. Jaimala , Minister for Women and Child Development, paid him a fitting tribute, “The news of veteran actor Loknath’s death has caused me immense pain. His contribution to Kannada cinema and theatre is immeasurable.”   The news of veteran actor Loknath’s death has caused me immense pain.

Siddaramaiah reacts to Modi’s ‘lollipop’ jibe|MYSURU|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|After Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, it was the turn of former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah to hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for criticising the coalition government’s farm loan waiver scheme. Speaking to reporters in Mysuru on Monday, Mr. Siddaramaiah took offence to Mr. Modi’s “lollipop” jibe at the loan waiver scheme. “OK, we have given lollipop. What pop has he given?”, asked Mr. Siddaramaiah. Questioning Mr. Modi’s moral right to criticise the State government, Mr. Siddaramaiah said the Prime Minister had failed to come to the aid of farmers when he led delegations twice as Chief Minister on the loan waiver issue. The Modi government at the Centre is against the agriculture sector and farmers, he alleged. He also questioned the contribution of the BJP-run State governments to farmers in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and till recently in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. Earlier, a large number of partymen met Mr. Siddaramaiah at his residence to complain against Periyapatna’s JD(S) MLA K. Mahadev for allegedly abusing Congress workers and leaders. He assured the party workers that he will discuss the issue with Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy.|0|

The company has evaded paying tax for the buildings and will have to pay a hefty amount as penalty. We are in the process of conducting a pre-audit to fix the fine. The process will take up to two months,” Mr. Jahangir said. Sources said the tax and penalty were being calculated as per Section 242 of the Kerala Municipality Act and the amount would come to around Rs. 50 lakh. Without permission According to officials, the joint inspection revealed that the company had constructed 10 buildings, with some having an area of up to 3,000 sq ft, without the permission of the municipality. Further, the probe found that it extended 22 buildings in the resort without obtaining necessary permission from the authorities concerned.|0|

Confusion over order on school holiday|Kozhikode|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|School students and parents in Kozhikode district were a confused lot on Monday evening after the Deputy Director of Education (DDE) brought out an order declaring a day-off for schools under the Education Department on Tuesday. The order was corrected later saying there will be classes in the morning. The initial order issued by E.K. Suresh Kumar, DDE, said that students from Class 1 to Class 10 in aided and government schools would have a day-off on Tuesday and January 19 would be a working day to compensate for it. As DDEs in no other districts had issued a similar order, it resulted in a great amount of confusion. It was pointed out that officials in the Department of Public Instruction were not consulted too. There were also allegations that the decision was taken against the backdrop of the women’s wall scheduled on the day. Mr. Suresh Kumar was not available for comments when mediapersons tried to contact him. Later, the Information and Public Relation Department informed through a WhatsApp message that the earlier order “should be corrected to read that there will not be classes in the afternoon”.

Mysuru’s Irwin Road widening continues amid murmurs of protest|Mysuru|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Despite murmurs of protest by some property owners and tenants on Irwin Road, the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) is continuing to acquire properties as part of its much-delayed project to widen the traffic-choked thoroughfare. MCC officials dismissed the claims that the consent of a majority of the property owners and tenants had not been obtained. “We have obtained the consent of as many as 76 owners out of the 84 properties identified for acquiring”, said H. Nagaraju, Development Officer of MCC’s Zone 6, under whose jurisdiction the road falls. He said the MCC had already registered about 40 properties in the name of the civic body by paying the owners compensation amounting to Rs. 13,072 for every sq. ft. Registered deeds had already been executed in the Sub-Registrar’s office by owners in favour of the MCC represented by the Assistant Commissioner of the Zone. He said one or two property owners had opposed the road widening, but the MCC is going ahead with the land acquisition process by paying the owners the amount agreed upon during a meeting held in the presence of the Deputy Commissioner of Mysuru recently. The MCC is expected to acquire more than 25,000 sq. ft to widen the road from its existing width of 9 to 11 metres to 18 metres from the Ayurvedic College Circle on Sayyaji Rao Road to Arch Gate opposite suburban bus stand. Once widened, Irwin Road is expected to become a four-lane road, providing the motorists much needed relief from traffic snarls. ‘Misleading’ Meanwhile, M.D. Doddaswamy Gowda, who is seeking to represent the tenants and property owners of Irwin Road, had contended that authorities were only misleading property owners, tenants and public by claiming that a majority had given their consent for surrendering part of their properties for road widening. He contended that there is “no proof of (authorities) exhausting all other remedial measures to overcome the heavy vehicular traffic on this road”. Mr. Gowda attributed the heavy vehicular traffic on the road to various reasons such as permission for two-way traffic, location of railway station and suburban bus stand at two opposite ends of the road, location of the city bus stand within its vicinity – all of which are generators of vehicular traffic on Irwin Road. “Without addressing these causes for traffic, mere road widening will not be a scientific solution”, he said. Also, he contended that the MCC had shown least concern towards heritage buildings existing on the road that include Unani Hospital, Chamaraja Technical Institute, Kalamma Temple, Mosque and State Bank of India at Nehru circle. He said a recent meeting of property owners had decided to not only petition the Deputy Commissioner and seek his intervention to stop the “illegal action” of road widening, but also file petitions in the High Court seeking relief.|0|
Rights panel suggests social impact study|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Kerala State Human Rights Commission has directed that a social impact assessment be conducted ahead of acquiring land for widening the Vazhayila-Nedumangad-Pazhakutti Road into a four-lane stretch. The agency entrusted with the study should hear complaints against land acquisition before taking a decision, the rights commission said. Commission chairperson Antony Dominic was acting on a complaint filed by Nabeesa Ummal, Abdul Salam, and M. Mohammed Kasim seeking a change in the current alignment. The complainants had said the alignment, decided by the Public Works Department (PWD), was illogical, and would result in a number of problems to the common people, including eviction. They were not heard before fixing the alignment, they said. Explanation submitted The District Collector and the PWD submitted explanations to the commission. The Collector said 11.86 hectares of land was being acquired for the development of the Vazhayila-Nedumangad road. Changes could not be made to the alignment, decided in a scientific manner. The current road contained curves and turns. The new alignment, for widening it into a four-lane accident-free road, was prepared as per the Indian Road Congress norms, the report said. Changing the alignment would lead to accidents. Land was acquired as per rules concerned. Those losing their land would be compensated as per a package, it said, adding that though it was a Rs. 340-crore project, the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board was yet to give its nod. The complainants, however, argued that if the alignment was not changed, the common man would suffer. Collector’s assurance The Collector informed the commission that only on the basis of the report of the agency conducting the social impact assessment would land be acquired. Mr. Dominic said the complainats should be heard prior to that; they could present their arguments in front of the agency.|0|

From MDMA and coke to LSD, Kochi saw it all|KOCHI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The city was on a high in the year gone by, literally. The year witnessed premium recreational drugs like methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), cocaine, and LSD to ganja being brought to the city by local and international drug peddlers. Cocaine seizure The New Year dawned with news of seizure of 4.50 kg of cocaine worth Rs. 25 crore, the biggest ever in the State, from a Filipino woman, suspected to be a carrier of a Latin America-based international drug cartel, at the Cochin international airport by the Narcotics Control Bureau. From Sao Paulo It was the third such case involving an international carrier in quick succession, and in all three cases the drug originated from Sao Paulo in Brazil, convincing the enforcement authorities that cocaine cartels increasingly preferred tier-two cities like Kochi as the transit point owing to tight monitoring at metro airports. Excise action A month later, Excise sleuths seized 5.2 kg of MDMA worth around Rs. 30 crore from two youths. The drug, bound for Kuwait, reportedly originated from Russia and reached the country via Afghanistan in what perhaps at that time was the first instance of attempted trafficking of a synthetic drug other than ephedrine to West Asia. In May, an El Salvador national was held with 2 kg of cocaine in pure form, and it was believed to have been sourced from the cocaine production belt in South America. Another 2.9 kg of cocaine were seized from a Venezuelan national who was also a carrier for an international drug cartel based out of Brazil in September. Big deal This was followed by the seizure of 30 kg of MDMA worth Rs. 200 crore from a courier parcel company. The parcel, which originated from Chennai, was bound for Malaysia. The year drew to an end with the seizure of 2 kg of methamphetamine, a stimulant party drug that also goes by the name ‘ice meth’, worth around Rs. 5 crore by the Kochi Shadow Police from a carrier working for a Chennai racket in December. Low-quality ganja trafficked from the Andhra-Odisha Naxal corridor for being sold as the locally grown variant called Idukki Gold; mushrooms, also known as magic mushrooms, containing psychedelic compounds; various hues of ampoules, and tablets also made their way into the city during 2018.|0|

Monkey fever: Travel advisory for pilgrims|Shivamogga|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|It is customary for a large number of pilgrims to visit Chowdeshwari temple in Sigandur, nestled amid dense forests in the Sharavathi backwaters region, during the Sankranti festival. As the temple is situated in Sagar taluk of Shivamogga district where there is a high incidence of Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), the Department of Health and Family Welfare plans to issue a travel advisory cautioning pilgrims. KFD, also known as monkey fever, is a vector-borne disease transmitted through ticks. The viral infection spreads from monkeys to humans through tick bite. High fever, bleeding in gums and ache in joints are some of the symptoms of the disease. Kiran S.K., Field Medical Officer, toldThe Hinduthat unnatural death of monkeys was reported in the forest near Hasirumakki where pilgrims board the barge to go to Sigandur. Tests conducted on the blood samples and viscera of two dead monkeys in Hasirumakki region have tested positive for KFD. Mr. Kiran said the situation warrants issuing a travel advisory to avoid a flare-up of the infection. It is a practice among pilgrims who visit Sigandur to consume food on the roadside. The verdant locations here are also spots for pre-wedding photo shoots. Pilgrims will be advised not to venture into the forest to avoid coming in contact with ticks. Boards will be installed on the roadside in Hasirumakki, Kalasavalli and Sigandur, issuing a warning. The department will also distribute pamphlets with ‘dos and dont’s’ at the point where tourists board the barge, he said. Sagar taluk has been in the grip of KFD, with two persons from Aralagodu Gram Panchayat having died of the disease in December. As many as nine positive cases have been reported here during this period. Mr. Kiran said that since October this year, around 31,000 persons from affected areas in the district have been administered the vaccine against KFD. In 2017, four persons died of KFD in the district and as many as 48 positive cases were reported.|0|

As there was a court instruction that examinations should not be postponed on hartal days, any cancellation of examinations was a contempt of court, he said in his letter to the CoEs. The HVM State committee strongly demanded that no examination be postponed in 2019 on hartal days, he said. Onus on govt. The letter to the CoEs said the universities need not worry about the inconvenience the students would experience on hartal days. It was the government’s responsibility to arrange facilities for the students to appear for the examination, the letter said. The universities could seek the help of the State government in this regard. Compensation for loss The High Court had made it clear that if the examination cannot be conducted despite providing protection, the loss incurred by the university should be levied from the organisations that called for hartal. The HVM also urged the universities to inform all political organisations either in writing or through the media of their firm decision that examinations would not be cancelled on hartal days.|0|
Steps to bring back school dropouts|KALPETTA|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|A meeting of the District Development Committee (DDC), chaired by District Collector A.R. Ajayakumar, has directed the Deputy Director of Education to check the enrolment register of students of all schools in the district on January 4 to curb dropout of children, especially tribal children, from schools. Many children earn money by joining the coffee and areca nut harvest during Christmas vacation and then drop out of schools, the meeting assessed. “If students are absent after Christmas vacation, school authorities should take steps to bring them back with the assistance of the Janamaithri police,” Mr. Ajayakumar said. The meet directed the Education Department officials to submit details of Class 10 students. If necessary, special coaching would be provided to students who lag behind in studies, Mr. Ajayakumar said. The meet also assessed that better results could be made in the district in SSLC examination by following the step. It also asked the District Medical Officer to submit an action plan to tackle malnutrition and anaemia among tribal students. Deputy Director of Dairy Department said the department could provide cattle free of cost to those dairy farmers who had lost their cattle in the recent deluge. 400 cows to farmers As many as 176 cows and 45 calves were killed in the flood in the district. Thirty-four cows and 100 calves were given to dairy farmers under the ‘Donate a Cow’ programme of the department so far. The department was planning to provide 400 cows to farmers this financial year under various projects, he said. C.K. Saseendran and O.R. Kelu, MLAs; K.B. Naseema, district panchayat president; and Wayanad subcollector N.S.K. Umesh attended the meet.  If students are absent after Christmas vacation schools must strive to bring them back|0|
Will miffed Nagendra change horses now?|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Mr. Nagendra was closely associated with the Ballari Reddy Brothers. He got elected from Kudligi on BJP ticket in 2008. He was accused of indulging in illegal transportation and export of iron ore and was arrested and jailed. Later, after G. Janardhan Reddy’s arrest on the charge of indulging in large-scale illegal mining, Mr. Nagendra kept himself away from the BJP. In the 2013 elections, he won for the second time from Kudligi as an Independent. Prior to the 2018 elections to the Assembly, Mr. Nagendra joined the Congress and was welcomed into the party by none other than AICC president Rahul Gandhi who kick-started electioneering from Hosapete. He won from Ballari (ST) defeating Sanna Phakkirappa, brother of Valmiki strongman of the BJP B. Sriramulu. Immediately after the elections, Mr. Nagendra was among the five out of the six Congress MLAs aspiring for a Ministerial berth but was not inducted then and also during the recent Cabinet expansion. There were reports that Mr. Ramesh Jarkiholi, as the then Minister in the coalition government, had supported Mr. Nagendra for a Ministerial berth. This was strongly opposed by other party MLAs in the district who had then urged the High Command to induct any one among them based on seniority. Efforts to contact Mr. Nagendra, who is said to be camping in Bengaluru, went in vain.|0|
Major haul of hashish oil|KOCHI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|In a major drug haul, the Kochi City shadow police seized one-and-a-half litres of high-grade hashish oil worth around Rs. 4 crore here on Monday. Four persons, including three Maldivians, allegedly connected with a Hong Kong-based international drug cartel, were arrested in this connection.

INL flays Kunhalikutty|KOTTAYAM|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Indian National League has criticised Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) general secretary P.K. Kunhalikutty, MP, for staying away from the Lok Sabha when it voted the triple talaq Bill last week. Addressing the media here on Monday, INL State secretariat member Najeeb termed the IUML leader’s absence improper. “This itself shows the party’s attitude towards the plight of Muslims in India. Time and again, it has shown us that power is greater than principle,” he said. He also accused the IUML of becoming a private limited company with only members of a few families holding positions of power. Regarding the Lok Sabha elections, Mr. Najeeb said the party, a constituent of the Left Democratic Front, was expecting more than one seat to contest. “It is crucial for every party to contest elections,” he said.|0|
No reserve conductors in three southern districts|THIRUVANANTHAPURAM|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) has not posted any of the newly-recruited reserve conductors advised by the Kerala Public Service Commission (PSC) in the depots in Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam and Alappuzha districts despite the termination of the services of empanelled conductors as directed by High Court. Posting orders have not been given to the 1,485 who came with advice memos of December 31, 2016, in the three districts, a top official of the KSRTC toldThe Hindu. The decision taken by the management in this regard had come at a time when complaints have come up against arbitrary posting of reserve conductors ignoring their home district. Those from the southern districts were given posting in Kozhikode zone and those from Kozhikode zone in Ernakulam zone of the KSRTC. Of the 4,071 empanelled conductors who were terminated by the management on December 18, the highest of 118 is in Thriuvananthapuram city unit. In Thiruvananthapuram district alone, over 1,100 empanelled conductors had lost their jobs. The decision not to post the new recruits in these three districts is to pave way for the transfer of conductors who had to go to northern districts on working arrangement when the transfer on home district basis was implemented. “We will carry out the transfer of these conductors in two months,” the official said. Of the 1,485 who had received posting orders from the Transport Bhavan based on the PSC advice memo, only 1,338 had reported for training. They have reported at the allotted depots in the 11 districts and have started working as conductors in the buses with the conventional paper ticket after the initial training. Extension sought Some have asked for extension of joining time as they have to be relieved from the job they are holding, sources said. The KSRTC has despatched the posting orders to the 4,051 adviced by PSC by post. Still, KSRTC hopes more will join as reserve conductors. The move is also seen as a ploy to give posting to the retrenched 4,071 empanelled conductors who have not completed 10 years and 120 days of minimum service in the KSRTC as the government had adopted a sympathetic stand towards them. Meanwhile, the KSRTC has said the services are getting to normalcy with the number of cancellation of schedules coming down on Monday with the joining of the reserve conductors. Of the 1,485 who have received posting orders based on PSC advice memo, only 1,338 have reported for trainingThe services are getting to normality with the number of cancellation of schedules coming down Of the 1,485 who have received posting orders based on PSC advice memo, only 1,338 have reported for training The services are getting to normality with the number of cancellation of schedules coming down|0|

‘Time to prepare children to ride out calamities’|KOCHI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Children in the flood-hit regions of Kerala could be trained in swimming and first aid as part of disaster preparedness, Unni Krishnan, director of the emergency health unit of Save the Children, Melbourne, has said. “We had met the flood-affected children here a few days ago. Some of them told us that they could have helped others if they knew swimming. We have been in discussion with a few planners on whether such sessions [on swimming and first aid] could be organised for the children,” he said here on Monday. Dr. Krishnan, who had served during health and humanitarian emergencies, often on the frontlines where people struggle with disasters, terror, and extreme weather events, was in town to share his views on the Kerala floods and the post-flood rebuilding exercise. The expert pointed out that the flood-affected children seemed fearful that the disaster would strike again. “They would like to know more about floods. Some people say do not talk about floods. But that is not the way to deal with it. You have to talk and be prepared,” he said. Citing the example of disaster preparedness in Cuba, especially in the wake of massive hurricanes hitting the region, Dr. Krishnan said children in that country are trained in swimming from the age of seven. “They are very well prepared to face any disaster,” he added. Recalling his interaction with the fishermen community in Kerala who had saved hundreds of lives during the floods, Dr. Krishnan said they too had echoed the view that more lives could have been saved if people had received first aid training. “They had seen many people bleeding after getting injured in the floods. You get the best ideas from them when you talk to them at the time of the disaster itself. They are the real heroes,” he observed. Maintaining that natural disasters have a binding effect on communities, Dr. Krishnan said floods in the State had brought out the best in people. “They came together. You have to be together in such situations,” he said. Dr. Krishnan reminded the authorities to step up disaster preparedness systems and ensure early alerts by taking lessons from the devastating floods.|0|

Peace is writ large on this wall|Palakkad|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|While the women’s wall to be formed across the State on Tuesday with the messages of gender justice and equality is evoking a heated political debate, a wall of permanent nature with the theme ‘freedom’ is getting ready in Cherpulassery here. Visualised by Suresh K. Nair, a teacher of fine arts at Benaras Hindu University, the wall is being built at the initiative of P.V. Shaheen, a lawyer practising in West Asia. The 7,000-sq-m wall is coming up around the Government Higher Secondary School in Cherpulassery with graffiti and relief works depicting the region’s long association with the freedom struggle, especially the 1921 rebellion against the British. “Fifteen of my students are converting the wall as a permanent gallery by portraying the struggles that shaped the present-day Malabar. The wall will be ready by January second week,” said Mr. Nair. In many tongues The word ‘peace’ would be etched on the wall in 200 languages. It would also carry messages for world peace and total disarmament. Above all, the wall is emerging as a rich tribute to freedom fighter Moozhikkunnath Brahmadathan Namboodiri, who was excommunicated for undergoing jail term for a false criminal case charged by the British police. Images of police atrocities on him are also depicted on the wall. “Moozhikkunnath was one of the public faces of the anti-British movement in the region. The wall is a memorial of sorts for him,” said Mr. Nair, a native of Adakkaputhur, who has initiated similar projects across the country, including the Wagah border. A winner of many awards for fine arts, Mr. Nair left for Benaras after a long stint with the Sri Sankara University of Sanskrit in Kalady. Around Rs. 20 lakh “The school has no wall. Now it is getting a unique wall that can attract visitors. Such a huge art wall is a rarity,” said P. Jose, Principal of the school. The fine arts students involved in the project hail from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Karnataka, and Uttaranchal. Mr. Shaheen and his friends in Cherpulassery are meeting the expenses of the wall that may cost around Rs. 20 lakh.|0|
Major projects in the pipeline|Kozhikode|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Kozhikode, which braved odds to combat the Nipah outbreak and the devastating floods last year, witnessed the implementation of several multi-crore projects. And it has high expectations of securing more projects this year. One of the major projects is the Rs. 120-crore superspecialty hospital envisaged under the Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY) on the Kozhikode Medical College campus. After the Nipah outbreak, the government decided to expand facilities at the existing virology laboratory with the assistance of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The opening of the Rs. 45-crore Tertiary Cancer Centre (TCC) at the medical college hospital is a relief for cancer patients in north Kerala. Flyovers The opening of flyovers at Thondayad and Ramanattukara junctions towards the fag end of the previous year has, to a certain extent, eased the traffic on the Kozhikode bypass. However, the new year will see the beginning of the works for converting the 28.8-km bypass into a six-lane carriageway. The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has awarded the contract to a Hyderabad-based firm for Rs. 1,710 crore. Another much-awaited project is the development of the Kozhikode railway station for which the Ministry of Railways has cleared the proposal for Rs. 75 crore under the two-stage Swiss Challenge Method. Air passengers of Kozhikode, Malappuram and parts of Wayanad are eagerly looking for the operation of wide-bodied aircraft by Air India at the Calicut airport. In December, Saudia (Saudi Arabian Airlines) resumed its operation after a three-year ban on jumbo jets assigned under Code E. It is expected the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) will give approval to the Dubai-based Emirates to operate big aircraft. The restoration of Haj embarkation point to the Calicut airport this year will benefit thousands of pilgrims from Malabar. The embarkation point for Haj pilgrims from Kerala and Lakshadweep had been shifted to Kochi in 2015 after the airport was partially closed for almost two years to strengthen and re-carpet the runway. From 2019, more flights will begin to operate both in the domestic and international sectors. Already, Dubai-based flydubai has announced the launch of direct flights, three times a week, to Kozhikode beginning February 1. The opening of the new international terminal at the Calicut airport, possibly in January, will provide more facilities to passengers. The new international arrival block will have 20 customs counters and emigration counters and about 5,000 people can be accommodated at a time.|0|
MCC to redeploy workers for better efficiency|Mysuru|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) will reorganise and rejig the civic machinery responsible for maintaining cleanliness in the city. This has become inevitable following the delimitation of wards which itself has come under flak for being unscientific. With the ward boundaries being re-drawn, the authorities have discovered that the earlier arrangement was not working as efficiently at present as certain residential areas were now part of a different ward where the manpower deployed for garbage collection was found to be inadequate. MCC Health Officer D.G. Nagaraj said that they noticed uncleared garbage and littering in certain places and the overall cleanliness standards in the city had taken a dip. “On assessing the reason, we discovered that consequent to the ward delimitation there was a need to rejig our manpower and machinery and we have taken it up now and expect positive results in terms of better cleanliness and higher standards of hygiene in the city.’’ Dumping yard The MCC has also taken note of the rampant littering on Bogadi Road leading to All India Institute of Speech and Hearing (AIISH) and along the median of the Vishwa Manava Double Road (from Bogadi Road junction to Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa Circle). The entire stretch has become a dumping yard for plastic and a special drive will be launched to clean it. “There is spurt in commercial activities along both the stretches where the number of street vendors is on the rise. Hence there is rampant littering on these stretches, which will be curbed’’, said the official. The MCC plans to launch a fresh drive to ensure that the city remains garbage free and there was segregation of waste at source. “We have discussed the issue and are seeking a date with Pramoda Devi Wadiyar, Yaduveer and former international cricketer Javagal Srinath who are the brand ambassadors for Swachh Mysuru’’, said Dr.Nagaraj. With the Swachh Survekshan 2019 leading to clean city rankings set to be launched on January 4, 2019 across the country, the MCC is bracing up for the city audit and third party inspections. “The dates for Mysuru’s inspection and public feedback is yet to be announced but the MCC is ready for it’’, said Dr. Nagaraju. Besides its existing pool of nearly 2500 civic workers, the MCC has also deployed new machinery paving way for greater mechanisation in cleaning the city. While additional tippers and 17 tractors have been procured, automatic sweeping machines will also be deployed to ensure that Mysuru gets a headstart over other cities in the cleanliness index.

Seer’s death, BJP’s wins dominated headlines in Udupi|UDUPI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Lakshmivara Tirtha Swami of Shiroor Mutt, 55, who passed away on July 19, the Assembly elections in which the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) made a clean sweep, and the missing fishing boat dominated the headlines in Udupi district in 2018. The Shiroor seer became the first among seers of the Ashta Mutts or eight mutts to file nomination papers as an independent candidate to contest the State Assembly elections from Udupi Assembly Constituency on April 21. But he also withdrew his nomination papers on April 27. For a few months, the Shiroor seer had a running battle with other seers of the Ashta Mutts urging them to hand over the presiding deities of his mutt, which he had given to be kept at the sanctum sanctorum of the Sri Krishna Mutt/Temple. But the seers of the Ashta Mutts wanted the Shiroor seer to take a junior seer. The Shiroor seer refused to do so and filed a caveat petition in the civil court here. This controversy continued till the Shiroor seer’s death. Even after his death, there was controversy over the cause of his death. But after investigation, it turned out that he died of health issues and it was a natural death. In the Assembly elections, the BJP made a clean sweep in the district by winning all five Assembly constituencies of Udupi, Kundapur, Karkala, Kaup and Byndoor on May 15. Halady Srinivas Shetty of BJP won by the highest margin of 56,405 votes. Pramod Madhwaraj, who was Minister in the Siddaramaiah cabinet, was defeated by Raghupati Bhat of BJP by 12,044 votes. A deep sea trawler, Suvarna Tribhuja, with seven fishermen on board, went missing off the Goa coast on December 15 even as efforts were on to trace it by the Coast Guard and the Navy. The Malpe Fishermen’s Association gave a three-day deadline to the State government on December 31 to trace the boat or face an intense agitation by fishermen. On January 18, Vidyadheesha Tirtha Swami of Palimar Mutt ascended the Paryaya Peetha at the Sri Krishna Mutt/Temple for the second time. The 88-year-old Vishwesha Tirtha Swami of Pejawar Mutt descended the Paryaya Peetha after completing his historic fifth Paryaya on the same day. President Ram Nath Kovind visited Udupi to felicitate the Pejawar seer on completion of his 80th anniversary of ‘sanyasa sweekara’ in Udupi on December 27.|0|
KU teachers’ body bats for gender balance|THIRUVANANTHAPURAM|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Setting a precedent for gender balance in the University of Kerala, the Kerala University Teachers Organisation (KUTO) has elected women to its top posts and ensured 50% women representation in its executive committee. The elections were held on Monday. S. Prema and C.N. Vijayakumari were both elected unopposed as president and vice-president respectively by the general body.

‘Trace missing boat in three days or face stir’|UDUPI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Malpe Fishermen’s Association has given an ultimatum of three days to the State government to trace the fishing boat with seven fishermen on board which went missing off the Goa coast. The boat, Suvarna Tribhuja, left the Malpe fisheries harbour along with about 20 boats for fishing in the deep seas on December 13. Addressing presspersons here on Monday, Satish Kundar, president of the association, said that the deep-sea trawler had seven fishermen on board, including Damodar, Laxman, Harish, Satish, Ravi, Ramesh, and the owner of the trawler, Chandrashekhar Kotian. The last communication from it was at 1 a.m. on December 15 when it was in touch with another fishing boat, Vasudeva. One message was traced by a mobile tower to a phone on board the missing boat (the message did not reach the phone) near Malvan in Maharashtra on December 16. But this was close to the same location from where the last communication was made. As no contact could be made with Suvarna Tribhuja from 5.30 a.m. onwards on December 15, the remaining boats sent wireless messages to other boats. The fishermen suspected that the boat may have been hijacked by local pirates or terrorists. There was no trace of the boat despite search operations by the Coast Guard and Navy in the sea and backwaters on the border of Goa and Maharashtra. The fishermen said that if the boat had sunk, the debris would have floated and there would be traces of oil spill. The local pirates could repaint and use the missing boat. The families of the seven fishermen were anxious, Mr. Kundar said. The fishermen were frightened. The boats that had returned to the Malpe fisheries harbour had not gone back to fishing. There were 1,100 deep sea trawlers in Malpe harbour, Mr. Kundar said. Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy should speak to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and get the central intelligence agencies to track the boat. If the boat was not traced in three days, the Malpe Fishermen’s Association along with other fishermen’s associations in three coastal districts of the State will launch an intense agitation, Mr. Kundar added.|0|

2 ex-Karnataka CMs continue Twitter war|Bengaluru|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Two former Chief Ministers Siddaramaiah and D.V. Sadananda Gowda continued their spat on Twitter on Monday over the horse trading remark made by the former on Sunday. Mr. Siddaramaiah’s tweet accusing the Bharatiya Janata Party of indulging in horse trading had received a sharp response from Mr. Gowda, who said the former was trying to cover up his party’s shortcomings. “A person who cannot mount the horse is neither brave nor a hero,” Mr. Gowda had tweeted, taking a dig at Mr. Siddaramaiah. However, it was Mr. Siddaramaiah’s turn on Monday. In response, he mocked at Mr. Gowda for having run away from the Chief Minister’s post in 11 months. Before a series of tweets in response to Mr. Siddaramaiah’s remarks, Mr. Gowda asked: “When did you become impatient about your politics being criticised? Is it the effect of your loss in Chamundeshwari or a reflection of your mind after losing the Chief Minister’s chair?” Later, the Union Minister said that the current politics of accusing others was an old strategy. “Just reminding you of the last seven months’ political developments....Congress won 78 seats and you lost in Chamundeshwari while winning in Badami by a margin of a few votes. You are not the Chief Minister now and Kumaraswamy became Chief Minister because of the high command and not you. Currently, your designation is limited to coordination committee, that is if it exists. Tell publicly if you have found an Opposition leader’s position within the ruling party.” In his response, Mr. Siddaramaiah tweeted: “Why was the Chief Minister post taken away from you? Why was Railway ministry taken away from you? In another year, why was Law ministry taken away from you? Why did you shift to Udupi-Chikkamagaluru from your home town Puttur and later come to Bengaluru? Why did you not mount the horse that was offered to you?”  A person who cannot mount the horse is neither brave nor a hero. When did you become impatient about your politics being criticised? Is it the effect of your loss in Chamundeshwari or a reflection of your mind after losing the Chief Minister’s chair?D.V. Sadananda Gowda  Why was the Chief Minister post taken away from you?

Water Metro to start sailing in December this year|KOCHI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|A total of 23 air-conditioned ferries that can carry 100 passengers will commence operation in December 2019 under the Rs. 750-crore Water Metro project, linking 19 boat terminals in the Greater Kochi area, Kochi Metro Rail Limited managing director A.P.M. Mohammed Hanish said. The rest of the 55 ferries, each with a passenger capacity of 50, will be introduced by 2020-end under the project which is the first of its kind in Asia. The ferries will thus traverse over 76 km, covering 16 routes in the backwaters surrounding Kochi, primarily benefiting people residing in islands and the coastal belt with better livelihood options. A total of 38 terminals will be built, with provision to add seven more. Solar-powered boats The Water Metro’s total fleet of 78 WiFi-enabled electric-powered ferries will completely shift to solar power by 2021 to bring about net-zero carbon footprint. Electricity charging points will be set up at the terminals. The modern ferries can navigate at up to 10 knots (18 kmph) speed which is more than double the speed of ferries now in operation. The ferries will take much less time than buses that cover the same route, Mr. Hanish told reporters here on Monday. A meeting in Thiruvananthapuram on Saturday, chaired by Chief Secretary Tom Jose, further decided that orders to procure the ferries would be issued in the first week of February. The ferries will have aluminium hull and fibre-reinforced plastic (FRP) body. Pricing Each 100-seater ferry will cost Rs. 4.50 crore, while each 50-seater ferry has been priced at Rs. 2.60 crore. KMRL will float a subsidiary company as special purpose vehicle (SPV) to take care of the operation and maintenance of the fleet, terminals, and related initiatives. On its part, the State government will recommend to the Centre to include the Water Metro in the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles (FAME) project which may also get tax exemption like the Kochi metro. German funding German Bank KfW will provide Rs. 576 crore, while the State government will grant Rs. 102 crore as loan for the project. The meeting further decided that the State would give administrative approval for Rs. 72 crore for land acquisition. The State government will also take steps to grant viability-gap funding through the Transport Department to the Water Metro. Its boat yards will be at Thevara where KSINC and KURTC have land and three acres of KINFRA land in Kakkanad. Infopark connectivity Mr. Hanish said there were two major issues while extending the ferry network to Infopark and the Smart City region. The Brahmapuram bridge has a vertical clearance of only 2.25 metres which is inadequate for ferries. Saturday’s meeting decided to demolish the bridge and construct a new structure which will have 5.50-m vertical clearance at a cost of Rs. 30 crore. The Chief Secretary has recommended a detailed study on shifting the bund at Kadambrayar. Narrow roads leading to ferry terminals will be widened, while public transport modes will be augmented to ensure seamless integration between road transport and the waterway corridor. A special card will be introduced under initiatives like A day’s tour of Kochi to encourage tourists to use the Water Metro. Government bodies will give permissive sanction to use their land abutting waterbodies to construct terminals. Additional Chief Secretary T.K. Jose said the Kerala Municipal Building Rules and the Kerala Panchayat Building Rules would provide exemptions as was given to the Kochi metro for construction of ferry terminals.|0|

CM questions NSS stance on equidistance|Thiruvananthapuram|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday told the leadership of the Nair Service Society (NSS) that its claim of equidistance from political alignments of all hues smacked of doublespeak. He said at a press conference here that the helmsmen of the NSS had forsaken the storied fights of their predecessors for social reform and embraced the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) which sought to push Kerala back into the dark ages of caste subjugation and obsolete religious custom in the name of preserving religious traditions. NSS singled out The Chief Minister singled out the NSS for attack on the eve of the women’s wall for gender equality.

No full-time VCs for four Kerala varsities|Kozhikode|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Four major State universities and a legal varsity in the State do not have full-time Vice Chancellors (VCs) now as the selection process has got tangled up. With the academic year set to end in three months, the situation is unlikely to change. Mahatma Gandhi University, Cochin University of Science and Technology (Cusat), A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Technological University, Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (KVASU), and National University of Advanced Legal Studies (NUALS) do not have VCs. While the incumbents at Mahatma Gandhi University, Cusat and NUALS completed their tenure a couple of months ago, the posts have been vacant for quite some time at the technological university and KVASU. To meet Governor Opposition student organisations are planning to meet Governor P. Sathasivam, who is also the Chancellor of universities, claiming that students have been forced to bear the brunt of the vacuum at the top. K.M. Abhijith, Kerala Students Union president, said that important files were getting stuck in departments. Many students were finding it tough to get certificates to pursue higher studies. Search panel The Governor had recently reconstituted a three-member search panel to select Vice Chancellors for MG University, technological university, and Cusat, after allegations of conflict of interest were raised against the members. One member is a nominee of the university, another recommended by the University Grants Commission and the third is nominated by the Governor. However, K.T. Jaleel, Minister for Higher Education, said senior professors were in charge at Cusat and MG University and a senior official had been in charge at the technological university. Full charge They had been given full charge to ensure that the day-to-day functioning was not hit. Academic works, including the conducting of examinations and declaration of results, would not be affected. “New VCs will be appointed before the next academic year,” he added. In the case of technological university, it was said that V.K. Ramachandran, vice chairman, State Planning Board, a member of the search panel, was chosen by a committee that included J. Letha, who was then in-charge VC and an aspirant for the post of VC. Sabu Thomas, VC in-charge of MGU, also reportedly an applicant for the post, was believed to be involved in the selection of J. Prabhash to the search panel. Similarly, R. Shashidharan, in-charge VC at Cusat, was part of the committee that selected B. Ekbal to the search panel. For NUALS, it is learnt that the search panel has been constituted.|0|
Ramesh Jarkiholi may soon quit Cong.|Bengaluru/Belagavi/Ballari|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Congress seems to be staring at a bigger trouble with more legislators making common cause with the former Minister from Belagavi Ramesh Jarkiholi, who is now reportedly getting ready to switch to the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party camp. The move of the former Minister, who is likely to tender his resignation to membership of the Legislative Assembly as well as the Congress after Makara Sankrati in January 2019, is expected to make the Janata Dal (Secular)-Congress coalition uneasy. While Mr. Jarkiholi has remained incommunicado for over a week now, one of his close aides and Congress legislator from Athani Mahesh Kumatavalli on Monday expressed solidarity with the former. Incidentally, Congress MLA for Ballari (ST) B. Nagendra, allegedly upset over missing out on the Cabinet berth, is reported to be with Mr. Jarkiholi. Mr. Nagendra was with the BJP in the past and had joined Congress in the presence of AICC president Rahul Gandhi just before elections. Sources in the Congress said that Mr. Jarkiholi, who is miffed with the party leadership after he was dropped from the ministry in the latest Cabinet reshuffle, is expected to join BJP. Mr. Jarkiholi is alleged to be in communication with BJP’s Central leadership in New Delhi. BJP State president B.S. Yeddyurappa’s recent extended stay in New Delhi has intensified the speculation of Mr. Jarkiholi meeting BJP top leaders to discuss about his possible defection. The State Congress leaders were unable to contact him after he was dropped from the Cabinet on December 22, 2018 and this caused discomfort to many leaders, including State Congress president Dinesh Gundu Rao and Minister for Forest and Environment Satish Jarkiholi, who is Mr. Ramesh’s younger brother. Kharge denies However, Congress leader in the Lok Sabha M. Mallikarjun Kharge maintained that Mr. Ramesh has been in the Congress for over two decades and he would continue to be in the party. The Jarkiholi brothers have strong influence in Belagavi district, which has 18 Assembly seats — the second highest in Karnataka after Bengaluru. Meanwhile, BJP State president and Leader of the Opposition B.S. Yeddyurappa, who returned to Bengaluru from New Delhi on Monday after meeting the party’s Central leaders, told reporters that the BJP will not attempt to topple the coalition government. He also clarified that the BJP was not in touch with any of the legislators from either Congress or JD(S). “BJP need not do anything to bring down this government. Coalition partners themselves are on a shaky ground following Cabinet expansion and portfolio allocation,” he said. He also took on former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, who had alleged that BJP had been indulging in horse trading to lure legislators by offering Rs. 25 crore to Rs. 30 crore. Mr. Yeddyurappa said: “Mr. Siddaramaiah has been regularly making irresponsible statements, while we have been telling them that we do not need to topple the government.” He challenged Mr. Siddaramaiah to furnish evidence to support his claims. “Such allegations do not suit his stature,” he said.|0|
Ending the year with zest|Kozhikode|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Leaving behind the sorrowful days of Nipah outbreak and devastating floods, the city on Monday found its joy in humble celebrations to sign off the last day of 2018. Majority of the hotels that hosted special new year celebrations were full of families. Despite the intense vigil by the police and restrictions on late-night parties, the tourism spots in the village areas too remained active on the new year eve. Though it was a working day, the Kozhikode beach, one of the major destinations for public gathering, witnessed good turnout on Monday too, where the police had put in place some traffic regulations. Taking into account public safety, no open celebrations were entertained on the beach. Also, vehicles with solo riders were denied entry to the spot. Music concerts were the choice for many urban residents who hosted private ghazal nites to celebrate the occasion. Private event organisers in the city too hosted ghazal parties to attract music buffs on the day. Some of the homestays in the rural areas too offered special new year eve celebrations for tourists. For many residents’ associations in the city, there were humble gatherings on Monday evening to celebrate the occasion with cultural programmes of their own members. There were also food fests to spice up the occasion in some of the residential areas. “We hosted the food fest mainly to feel the joy of sharing on the New Year eve. Residents themselves cooked a variety of food and brought to a common venue for sharing among members,” said Sreejith, a member of the West Kara Residents Association. In the wake of the State-wide alert on possible rave parties and drug trafficking, the police deployment was strong in the city and rural areas. Plainclothesmen had been deployed in several locations covering major railway stations, bus stands and streets. The intensified vigil resulted in the arrest of two carriers who purchased party drugs for secret celebrations.|0|
Jaggery from other States adulterated|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Large amounts of jaggery reaching Kerala from other States have been found to be adulterated. The adulteration was detected in Operation Panela, an exercise launched by the Department of Food Safety to spot adulteration in jaggery found in markets in the State. Raids were conducted by squads, led by the Food Safety Commissioners, in all 14 districts. Operation Panela was launched on a directive of Minister for Health K.K. Shylaja, who is in charge of the Department of Food Safety, after recent chemical analysis of jaggery samples indicated presence of chemicals and artificial colours in it. Directive for stern action The Minister said instructions had been given for strict action against those responsible for adulteration of food products.

Cockfights go unchecked on Chittoor-Tamil Nadu border|CHITTOOR|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|With Sankranti fervour catching up in the rural areas along the Chittoor-Tamil Nadu border in the eastern mandals of the district, it has also brought frenzied activity in organising cockfights in forest locations, involving participants from Varadaiapalem and B.N. Kandriga in Chittoor district; Tada and Sullurupeta in Nellore district; and a number of villages in Tamil Nadu as far as Gummadipoondi. On Sunday night, the police raided a forest location near Varadaiahpalem and reportedly arrested 25 participants, and seized Rs. 20,000 and six roosters and a few motorcycles, while many others escaped. This is the fourth raid in the forest locations in the last six months. Varadaiahpalem SI Hari Prasad said the terrain of Varadaiahpalem mandal came in handy for cockfight organisers as it is predominantly a semi-forest zone, coupled with its proximity to the coastal villages of Nellore district, and Tamil Nadu border. The Tada-Chennai NH is just a few kilometres away. The police officer said that in spite of surveillance, the organisers reach the forest locations, and hold cockfights with huge amounts at stake. The parties, carrying the roosters come to the fixed locations all the way from the border villages. “The punters are mostly farmers and farm workers. The organisers have an excellent network, luring the middle class people and younth to join the betting,” the official said. Evading police With Sankranti around the corner, the cockfight organisers are in search of new locations to avoid detection by the police. “The organisers mostly fix the timings between 1 p.m. and 5 p.m., as some of them who were caught informed us that they have an opinion that the police would be relaxed during these hours,” Mr. Prasad said. To tackle the menace, the police have appealed to the court to impose convictions, including a week-long sentence and hefty fines on the organisers of cockfights. “This could to some extent deter the organisers from continuing the illegal fights,” the official said.|0|

Such reformist ideas, which took root in the oppressed communities first, later spread to the so-called forward castes too. Narayana Guru was the source of strength for this movement against regressive and superstitious practices, which affected all sections of people. In rebuilding Kerala, we need to draw on those ideals,” he said. He said the focus of rebuilding should not be on reinstating what was lost, but on rebuilding in such a way as to resist future disasters. “A sustainable way of living has to be inculcated. There should be a change in mindset to follow the idea of reduce, repair and recycle. We should build using materials that can resist natural calamities. Construction activity should not be carried out on hill slopes or in areas of frequent flooding. “The rebuilding of houses destroyed in the floods will be completed by the end of the financial year,” he said. Former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy, who presided over the function, said the previous rebuilding of Kerala society took place during Narayana Guru’s era, which witnessed several reform movements. ‘Life with equanimity’ “Though Guru had broken the barriers of caste and religion, he did so without shedding a drop of blood. He was able to handle with equanimity all opposition to his reform movements. He did not ask anyone to be an atheist. “Rather, he took along the atheists and those from other religions, in bringing about change,” said Mr. Chandy. Narayana Guru taught that humanity was the biggest religion, Karnataka Governor Vajubhai Vala has said.  ‘Advocate of humanism’ He was inaugurating the pilgrim meet as part of the 86th Sivagiri pilgrimage here on Monday. “Guru never stood for a specific caste or religion. He exhorted everyone to get proper education. He taught us how to live one’s life. Guru gained followers across the world for these reasons,” he said. SNDP Yogam general secretary Vellappally Natesan said brotherhood beyond all borders was Guru’s greatest message. “The Sivagiri pilgrimage has a clear aim and a strong message. Knowledge is the gift that the devotees get in Sivagiri.”|0|

An app to cure your mobile addiction|Bengaluru|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|If you are one of those tech addicts who can’t help but spend most your waking life glued to your cell phone, relief may finally be at hand – on your cell phone. Doctors at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS) have come up with a mobile app that helps people reduce their mobile usage. The Service for Healthy Use of Technology (SHUT) clinic has developed a Digital Detox app that has been found to be effective in bringing about behavioural changes among users. The app, available on Google Playstore as ‘Digital Detox by Shut Clinic’, requires you to register. Once you sign up, it tracks your pattern of mobile usage every week and offers self-help strategies. The app asks users to specify their addiction-related symptoms, such as sleep disturbance, eye strain, loneliness, boredom, or excess Facebook usage. It asks users if their mobile usage affects their academics, work or interpersonal relationships, and has a feature where you also have the option of sharing your progress with friends. A pilot test of the app was done between September 2017 and September 2018 among 240 college students aged 18-25. The study found that 75.6% of the app’s users changed their mobile use pattern and showed significant reduction in the time spent on technology. Three categories Manoj Kumar Sharma, professor of clinical psychology, NIMHANS and head of SHUT clinic, said that users were classified into three categories based on their technology usage: mild, moderate and severe. “We have enough data to indicate that those who were using tech tools in moderation have introduced lifestyle changes and now fall under the ‘mild users of technology’ category,” he said. But he added that the data was insufficient to prove if the app was helpful to those who were severely addicted to technology. ‘Biggest benefit’ Dr Sharma said that the app’s biggest benefit was that it helped people who would otherwise not be willing to seek help. “It is in fact an irony that we are using technology to beat technology. But we realised that this is the only way out,” he said. The app developers have followed the principle that technology de-addiction should be supportive, encouraging and fun. They now plan to further refine the app by incorporating gaming addiction in addition to internet and mobile phone addiction.|0|

Biopic on NTR challenging: Krish|GUNTUR|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|For film director Krish Jagarlamudi, the run-up to New Year is tense. The much-awaited film ‘NTR Kathanayakudu’ -- a biopic on legendary NTR -- is all set for release on January 9. “I am not new to a period film and this is my fourth such one. I have directed ‘Gautami Putra Satakarni’, ‘Kanche’ and ‘Manikarnika’, my upcoming film, but it’s a challenge to do a biopic on NTR,” Krish says after launching the website of SHRI Hospitals in Guntur.

High Court sets aside ED’s order|HYDERABAD|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Hyderabad High Court on Monday set aside an order of Enforcement Directorate issued six years ago provisionally attaching fixed deposits of Rs. 822 crore belonging to Tech Mahindra. On October 10, 2012, the Joint Director of ED passed an order provisionally attaching Rs. 822 crore of fixed deposits belonging to the then Satyam Computers company under Prevention of Money Laundering Act. These fixed deposits were with Andhra, ING Vysya, IDBI and Baroda banks. In the charge-sheet, the ED stated that the deposits were proceeds of crime under PMLA.  The counsel for Tech Mahindra presented to the HC that there was no money in Satyam Computers when Mahindra group took over it. The latter infused money to revive the fraud-hit company, they contended. Initially, a single judge of Hyderabad HC stayed the ED’s attachment order following which the ED filed an appeal. A division bench comprising Justice V. Ramasubramanian and Justice J. Uma Devi heard the petition. The bench observed that if the Rs. 822 crore fixed deposits of the company were proceeds of crime, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs could not have auctioned the same through competitive price bids. “After one wing of the government had induced a third-party like the strategic investor to come to the rescue of the company, another government wing cannot take action that will vitiate the entire process,” the bench said in the verdict.|0|

Loan waiver: final instalment to be released soon|KAKINADA|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The State government is going to release a sum of Rs. 8,000 crore towards the final phase of farm loan waiver within a fortnight from now. Announcing this at a press conference at his camp office here on Monday, Finance Minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu said that with the release of the final instalment, the farm loan waiver programme would come to an end in the State, as promised to the peasantry by the Telugu Desam Party during the 2014 general elections. “Despite having severe financial problems and non-cooperation from Centre, the State government has successfully fulfilled all the promises made to the cross section. Since we are not compromising on implementing the welfare schemes, it is inevitable to go for loans. Still, we are taking care to reduce the burden by way of opting for loans with low rate of interests,” he said, adding that plans were afoot to implement loan waiver to the tune of Rs. 1,000 crore to the members of the women self-help groups.

CM Ramesh fulfils his vow at Tirumala|TIRUPATI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|As a thanksgiving to Lord Venkateswara after the successful laying of the foundation stone for the Rayalaseema Steel Corporation plant by Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu last week, Rajya Sabha member C.M. Ramesh tonsured his head on Monday ahead of offering prayers at the Tirumala temple. Mr. Ramesh, who spearheaded a movement to pressure the Centre, had taken a vow to this effect. With the Centre not forthcoming, the State government decided to establish the plant on its own. The Telugu Desam MP told the media Mr. Naidu would monitor the progress of work to ensure its completion on time. “The steel plant is of vital importance for the Rayalaseema region, as the Polavaram project is to the coastal districts,” he said.|0|
Emotions run high as High Court is bifurcated|HYDERABAD|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Some struggled to hold tears, a few wept and many tried to hide their sadness by putting a brave smile. An aura of sentiments and emotions filled the sprawling front yards of the imposing Hyderabad High Court building on the bank of Musi in Old City as its nearly 300 employees boarded buses bound for Vijayawada on Monday. They were allocated to the newly constituted Andhra Pradesh High Court which will start functioning from New Year day. With the new HC slated to begin from the AP Chief Minister's Camp Office in Vijayawada city from Tuesday, the employees had to start on Monday from the Hyderabad HC. More than the over 225 km journey, all of them were apparently upset over leaving the Hyderabad HC which they served for years. “Feeling bad, but cannot help. Let us meet up again and be in touch,” were the common parting wishes. As the fleet of buses entered the building to ferry them, some couldn't control tears. Office boys and attenders too had tough time loading vehicles with loads of file bundles. Some of them had to finish the work and get into the buses for Vijayawada. Those allocated for the new HC for Telangana too were there bidding adieu to their colleagues heading for Vijayawada. Some employees hailing from Telangana but allocated to AP HC met the authorities to consider their retention. But they had to return to the buses disappointed on being told that their request cannot be honoured now. Coconuts broken Earlier in the day, the Chief Justice of Hyderabad HC Thottathil B. Radhakrishnan and other judges adjourned their respective courts after attending to urgent matters. Led by the CJ, 12 judges allotted to the HC for Telangana (which is also commencing from Tuesday) came to the front yards of the building to see off 14 judges allotted to AP High Court. Acting Chief Justice of AP High Court, C. Praveen Kumar and the Hyderabad HC CJ Radhakrishnan broke coconuts as the journey of judges in cars with escort police began. For a few moments, an eerie silence reigned there followed by shake-hands and hugs. Though a separate State for Telangana was created on June 2, 2014 out of erstwhile united AP, the two Telugu states had unified Hyderabad HC. Five days ago, a presidential order was issued notifying constitution of separate HCs for Telangana and AP at Hyderabad and Amaravathi respectively. Both High Courts were to commence functioning on Tuesday. Meanwhile, lawyer P.V. Krishnaiah moved the Hyderabad High Court, seeking deferment of the division. It was heard and dismissed by a division bench headed by Justice V. Ramasubramanian.|0|
Forest department turns blind eye to the illegal trade of clams|MACHILIPATNAM|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The illegal collection and export of various types of clams is rampant in the Krishna Wildlife Sanctuary, reportedly with the active involvement of some Avanigadda Forest Range authorities. The clams, mostly Ark Clams which belong to the bivalve class of marine and freshwater molluscs, are under threat in the sanctuary. The middlemen are dictating terms in tapping the market in Asia where the meat is consumed. They have been enjoying a field day since early 2018. Amid fear of exposure of the illegal activity, the staff caught a boat carrying bags of clams in December. In February 2018, the district police tracked a lorry transporting the clams to Chennai via the national highway. Around the same period, the forest task force seized a lorry loaded with the clams in Guntur district which indicates the thriving trade. Sources associated with the raids toldThe Hinduthat the clams were in great demand in Singapore. “Chennai-based middlemen hire locals for collection and send them to Singapore.” A special team of the Wildlife Division (Eluru) prepared an action plan early 2018 to crack a whip but could not implement it, owing to transfer of the respective officials by that time. A boat loaded with the clams was caught by the Avanigadda Forest Range team in the midnight of Sunday in the sanctuary. Chief Wildlife Warden D. Nalini Mohan said there was no permission for collection of the clams for any commercial purpose. Krishna University Biotechnology Assistant Professor P. Veera Brahmachari said: “Irrespective of the conservation status, the collection will dramatically impact the food system in the mangroves.”|0|
Iceberg lettuce in drylands of Kalaburagi?|Kumar Buradikatti|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|If agricultural scientists in Kalaburagi succeed in an experiment they are carrying out, farmers of this dry northern district could soon be growing exotic vegetables such as iceberg lettuce and broccoli in their farms. To help farmers of the backward district get better income, scientists of Kalaburagi’s Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) are experimenting if high-income yielding foreign crop varities can thrive in this environment. In the first phase, they have imported five exotic vegetable seeds — iceberg lettuce, straight lettuce, cherokee lettuce, broccoli and red cabbage — from the Netherlands and planted them on the campus. “These vegetable seeds can be produced only in cold environments, in areas with less than 20 degrees Celsius temperature. But, they can be grown in Indian conditions during winter. We have planted half of these seeds inside the shade-net and remaining outside. We are giving organic fertilizer and water to both. If there is not much difference between those grown inside and outside, we will recommend the farmers to grow them outside the net so that the shade-net costs too can be saved,” Vasudev Naik, a horticulture scientist, toldThe Hindu. The scientists have formed a couple of teams for a survey to assess the marketing potential of the new vegetables. “Domestically grown cabbages and cauliflowers are sold at around Rs. 25 a kg or less as compared to Rs. 80 a kg that red cabbage and broccoli are sold at. Iceberg lettuce is sold at over Rs. 200 a kg. These are supplied from faraway places to Kalaburagi market in limited quantity,” Akshata Biradar, a student who participated in the market survey, said. Scientists feel that the experiment could pave way for better utilisation of shade-net and polyhouse farming in the region. “The government is offering subsidies for shade-net, polyhouse and drip-irrigation equipment. But farmers are failing to use them,” Raju Teggalli, a senior scientist and the head of Kalaburagi KVK, said.|0|
‘BJP alone can steer nation to greater heights’|ONGOLE|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Bharatiya Janata Party State president Kanna Lakshminarayana has underscored the need for another term for the BJP-led NDA government to step up development across the country with greater vigour. Addressing the media here on Monday, Mr. Lakshminarayana said the ruling Telugu Desam Party, which was “steeped in corruption,” had joined hands with “equally corrupt” Congress which would have to pay for ‘the omissions and commissions’ sooner than later in the Rs. 3,600-crore Agusta Westland VVIP chopper scam case with the extradition of the arms dealer as the probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation had reached the final stages. Terming the 2019 polls as the one between the ‘development-oriented’ NDA and “corrupt forces,” he said celebrations were organised in Pakistan to celebrate the Congress party’s win in three States. The BJP should retain power in 2019 to keep the “anti-national” forces at bay, he said. Denying Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu’s charge that the BJP, the YSR Congress Party and the Telangana Rashtra Samithi were hand in glove with each other, he said: “It has become a habit for Mr. Naidu to drag the name of Prime Minister Narendra Modi into anything and everything.” PM visit Fearing speeding up of hearing in the cash-for-vote scam in Telangana, the shifting of the High court was hastened by the A.P. government by submitting that the High Court buildings were completed even before they were ready for occupation, he said, adding how could the Centre be blamed by the TDP now. He clarified that Mr. Modi’s public meeting on January 6 was postponed as it clashed with the one in Kerala and not at all in response to the TDP’s ‘Modi go back’ call.|0|
‘Political power key to uplift of OBCs’|TIRUPATI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Congress party reiterated its resolve to work for the welfare of Other Backward Classes (OBCs) and said political power was the key to ensuring socio-economic development of the marginalised communities. Commemorating the formation of the Mandal Commission on December 31, 1978, exactly 40 years back, the party leaders garlanded the statue of Jyotirao Phule on Monday and took out a procession to Ambedkar Bhavan, where they organised a meeting on ‘Mandal Commission and review of OBC development’. Former Union Minister Chinta Mohan recalled that it was Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao who had issued the first job under this reservation system. Tracing the sequence of events, he explained how the former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and senior advocate K. Parasaran helped revive the law from the brink of getting scrapped in 2014. Dr. Mohan flayed the UGC for trying to twist the benefits that have to go to the OBCs by considering department as a unit, in place of university earlier. The Praja Ballot conducted on the occasion overwhelmingly supported political reservation for the OBCs. Youth leader Chinta Bharat, party OBC leaders Ramachandra, Somprakash Yadav and Savitri Yadav took part in the event.|0|

Moreover, the CSI was the only Indian Church recognised by the UNDP with an eco award, he said. 12-point document The CSI Ecological Concerns Department headed by Mathew Koshy Punnackadu developed the 12-point GPGD guideline document. It aimed at a sustainable development model by promoting green congregations at all its 16,000 parishes. All parishes were supposed to abide by the protocol and effectively participate in the green discipleship of the Church, the Moderator said. Dr. Punnackadu toldThe Hinduthat the GPGD guidelines proposed planting of a sapling each in the church compound during important functions and to commemorate the visit of important personalities. After wedding services, the newly wedded couple would have to plant a sapling in the church compound. Saplings could also be planted in memory of a dead member, he said. Fruit-bearing plants  Dr. Punnackadu said the document encouraged planting of fruit-bearing plants in public places.

Red sanders protection got enhanced focus in 2018|Tirupati|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Red Sanders Anti Smuggling Task Force (RSASTF) cracked the whip on smugglers and woodcutters in the year 2018, ensuring tightening of vigil and arrest of hardcore criminals, besides creating awareness in the neighbouring States on the risks involved. The task force got the much-awaited shot in the arm this year, with the first-ever conviction happening after the amendment made in 2016 to the Andhra Pradesh Forest Act 1967. Of the 17 smugglers involved in six cases who were convicted, the first one was Kuppan Shanmugam (48), a resident of Nayakaneri in Vellore district of Tamil Nadu. He had been handed out rigorous imprisonment for five years and a fine of Rs. 3 lakh on March 16. A whopping 12,119 accused were arrested in the last four years, all from Tamil Nadu. Vellore and Tiruvannamalai districts, considered the major source that dispatches woodcutters to Seshachalam, contributed 2,701 and 3,063 respectively, followed by Salem (2,157), Villupuram (1,118), Dharmapuri (677), Chennai and Kanchipuram (506 each), Krishnagiri (467), Tiruvallur (428), Trichy (262), Sivagangai (91), Puducherry (66), Namakkal (51) and so on. In 2018 alone, Tiruvannamalai topped with 187 arrested by intercepting the vehicles used for smuggling, followed by Vellore (115), Salem (82), Villupuram (58), Chennai (35) among others. This year, 337 cases were booked, 897 arrested and remanded to judicial custody, 244 vehicles seized and 5,807 red sanders logs, weighing 123.374 metric tonnes recovered. “The huge number of arrests should not be construed as a rise in crime, but a result of the tightening of noose around the perpetrators,” reasons RSASTF Inspector-General of Police M. Kantha Rao. A total of 23 smugglers were booked under Preventive Detention Act, 12 of them in Kadapa, eight in Nellore, two in Chittoor and one in Tirupati Urban police district. Though Kadapa has 70% of red sanders wealth compared to the 17% in Chittoor (Tirupati), the latter hogs much of the limelight. Technology played a vital role in tracking the trail of smugglers and cornering them at the right spot. Be it Fingerprint Identification Networking System (FINS), Global Positioning System (GPS) or mobile Call Data Records (CDR) from tower dump, the task force effectively used advanced technology and sophisticated equipment to breathe down the neck of the smugglers and sniff them out of the woods. Repeat offenders were easily identified through FINS. The government has also succeeded in escalating the issue across the nation. The meeting of the Directors-General of Police of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala and Telangana held this year helped share sensitive information about the logs, the preferred escape routes and the need for cohesive attention to achieve synergy. The task force, on its part, conducted a series of awareness meetings in the bordering districts of Tamil Nadu, cautioning the gullible woodcutters who unknowingly arrive here on ‘dubious assignments’ about the gravity of the crime and the perils of accepting such tempting offers from notorious agents. On the flip side, the achievement on the crime prevention front was far from satisfactory.|0|

Refer triple talaq Bill to select panel: Naidu|VIJAYAWADA|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Strongly opposing the Central government’s attempt to move the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill (Triple Talaq Bill) in the Rajya Sabha, Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu insisted that the legislation should be referred to a select committee of Parliament. ‘CR.P.C. is enough’ Speaking to mediapersons on Monday, Mr. Naidu said action could be taken on the culprits under Criminal Procedure Code in the event of the declaration of marriage as invalid, but they cannot be punished in any other manner. He observed that parties such as the AIADMK were bringing in other issues allegedly to enable the Centre to somehow push through the controversial Bill in what appears to be a ploy similar to the disturbances created by the AIADMK, Telangana Rashtra Samiti and others during the discussion on no-confidence motion moved by the Telugu Desam Party in the Lok Sabha recently. Mr. Naidu said Muslims were citizens of this country and there should not be separate laws on the basis of religion and caste. No separate law If there was no uniformity, it would not be a democracy, Mr. Naidu stated, adding that he appealed to the leaders of Congress, Trinamool Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (Arvind Kejriwal) and instructed the TDP MPs to thwart the BJP’s plans to enact the Bill in question.|0|

LDF’s women’s wall today|Thiruvananthapuram|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Left Democratic Front (LDF) has mobilised its workers in strength to ensure that the proposed women’s wall for gender equality manifests as an emphatic proclamation of its political might on New Year’s Day on Tuesday. The ruling front’s flagship public programme is also being viewed as a flexing of its political muscle ahead of the Lok Sabha elections in 2019, and a rebuff to the Hindu Aikya Vedi-sponsored Ayyappa Jyothi on December 26. The wall is set to unfold across Kerala amidst strident criticism from the Opposition and in the face of the threat of a boycott by prominent social organisations, notably the Nair Service Society (NSS). The LDF has claimed that it will nevertheless assemble 31 lakh women in an unbroken 640-km-long human wall spanning the State from Kasaragod in the north to Thiruvananthapuram in the south. The wall will stretch out between 4 p.m. and 4.15 p.m. across the length of Kerala almost simultaneously. As many as 176 organisations, including the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP) Yogam and the Kerala Pulayar Maha Sabha, have declared their support for the wall. The organisers said women would mobilise at 3 p.m. and deploy alongside major State and National Highways by 4 p.m. They will disperse after taking an oath to uphold the renaissance principles. The LDF has fielded a galaxy of political leaders and celebrities in an attempt to record the event for posterity as a watershed in the history of modern Kerala. Leaders, actors Veteran communist K.R. Gouri would join the wall in Alappuzha. Women in Cinema Collective members Parvathy Thiruvoth, Rima Kallingal, Remya Nambeesan, Bina Paul, and Geethu Mohandas are expected to be part of the lineup. Critic M. Leelavathy and writers P. Valsala and Khadeeja Mumtaz and athletes Mercy Kuttan and Preeja Sreedharan and boxer K.V. Lekha will be present. Men are also expected to attend the programme in strength. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan will witness the human wall in Thiruvananthapuram. His Cabinet colleagues will attend the event in various districts allocated to them. The police have upped security in the State given the profound political differences that have emerged following the Supreme Court verdict allowing the entry of woman of all ages to Sabarimala.|0|

Tribal youngsters fall prey to ganja smuggling ring|VISAKHAPATNAM|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|It is no secret that ganja (cannabis) is being cultivated in the interior pockets of Visakhapatnam agency and smuggled illegally to other States and cities such as Hyderabad, Bengaluru, New Delhi and Goa. But, what worrying the City Task Force (CTC) more is the growing number of tribal youth getting sucked into the smuggling ring. As per Assistant Commissioner of Police (CTF) I. Chittibabu, about 41 ganja smuggling cases were recorded in the city limits and 117 accused were nabbed in 2018. “More than 50% of the accused were tribal youth. Hailing not only from Visakhapatnam city but also from Tamil Nadu and Kerala, the youngsters were hired by the big fish of the illicit trade to shift the contraband from the interior parts of the Visakhapatnam agency to other destinations,” Mr. Chittibabu explained. But the real area of concern, he said, is the youth being getting addicted and then turning into courier agents for the smugglers. “The entire operation is a heady mix. First the youngsters get into ganja addiction, then they are lured by the smugglers to work as pedlars or courier boys. Some of the youth resort to smuggling ganja on their own for easy money,” he added. According to records, the CTF has seized about 2,149 kg of dry ganja valued at Rs. 85 lakh, in 41 cases reported from Visakhapatnam city in 2018 alone. Modus operandi According to officials, the CTF has recently found that there are indications of tribal youth shifting weed to different places in Goa and trading it with other sedative drugs as LSD (Lysergic acid diethylamide). However, the police are yet to ascertain the detailedmodus operandi.But they suspect that drugs including LSD are being brought back from Goa in small quantities and sold in cities such as Visakhapatnam, Bengaluru and Hyderabad. ganja, especially the Sheelavathi variety that is grown in Visakha agency, is in high demand in cities such as Bengaluru and Goa and the tribal youth exchange ganja for LSD which they are suspected to route it to Hyderabad and Vizag. Easy money “One kg of ganja (Sheelavathi variety) is procured for around Rs. 2,000 from the agency area, but sold at Rs. 15,000 per kg in Hyderabad, Bengaluru or Goa,” said the ACP. It is estimated that each smuggler carry at least 10 kg of ganja, and in exchange they procure LSD, which cost around Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 1,500 per blot or hit in Goa. When the same LSD reaches Hyderabad it is sold at Rs. 3,000 to Rs. 3,500 per blot, a senior excise official said, requesting anonymity.|0|

Foundation stone to be laid for Ramayapatnam port on Jan. 9|VIJAYAWADA|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu has said that foundation for the Ramayapatnam port in Prakasam district will be laid on January 9 as the Central government dragged its feet on the establishment of the proposed port at Dugarajapatnam in Nellore purportedly on the grounds of non-feasibility. Besides, the government has set the stage for inaugurating the Orvakal airport in Kurnool district on January 8 following successful trial run. Projects The State government is pursuing 2,622 mega and large industrial projects with a total investment of approximately Rs. 15.50 lakh crore, of which 810 have gone into production with a committed investment of Rs. 1.77 lakh crore. The Industry Mission targeted to increase the contribution of manufacturing sector to the Gross State Domestic Product to 15% by 2020 from 9.95% in 2013-14, Mr. Naidu has stated. Releasing the White Paper on ‘industry, employment and skill development’ on Monday, Mr. Naidu said the total budget provided to the Department of Industries since June 2014 stood at Rs. 7,968 crore. From June 2014 to December 2018, the government released Rs. 3,675 crore as industrial incentives which include the inherited backlog of Rs. 2,060 crore which has been pending since 2010-11. Priority has been attached to the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), financial technology businesses, complying with the Public Service Delivery Guarantee Act 2017 to improve the ease-of-doing-business and attracting investments into the Visakhapatnam-Chennai Industrial Corridor (VCIC) and Chennai-Bangalore Industrial Corridor (CBIC) clusters situated in the State.

Chandrasekhar Rao’s election promise this month of finding a ‘solution’ to the ‘podu’ lands which are being cultivated in forest clearings. Large extents of forest have already been illicitly felled for converting them into agriculture lands by villagers as a result of a similar promise within the ambit of Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA), implemented in 2008. These aspects broadly constitute a mixed bag in the area of biodiversity and environment in the once nature haven, former united Adilabad district, during 2018. “Environment received comparatively good attention this year but there remains much to be done,” opined a forest department official. Vulture, tiger figures  The current population of critically endangered Indian long billed vulture (Gyps indicus) at the Pala Rapu habitat in Penchikalpet Forest Range in Kumram Bheem Asifabad district is at a healthy 22 with the scavenger birds flourishing in eight nests and three roosting sites. Some more vultures are considered to have flown to the Kamalapur-Lakkamedala habitat in neighbouring Gadchiroli of Maharashtra, about 10 km away. The movement of Phalguna within Kagaznagar forests is being monitored closely which provides her and her cubs a tight security ring. The Forest department has begun phase III monitoring of its tiger population. The KTR is expected to welcome at least three cubs in Tipeshwar Wildlife Sanctuary as they get ready to move out and mark their own territory. KTR has often sourced its tiger population to this sanctuary, which is located in Pandharkawda taluk of Yavatmal district in Maharashtra, about 60 km from Kawal. Lost cubs, tree felling Two things, nevertheless, which will keep conservationists worried in the new year is the failure so far of the department in capturing K4 tigress in Chennur forests to relieve it of the steel noose around its abdomen and the absence of three cubs from the first litter of Phalguna. The department hopes to capture K4 soon though there is no hope of tracing the three ‘lost’ cubs. “We fear large scale felling of trees in reserve forests in KB Asifabad, Mancherial, Nirmal and Adilabad districts what with the government assuring the villagers of ‘rights’ on the clearings. The government should have made an announcement after formulating a proper policy for protecting forests as well,” lamented another Forest department official.|0|

Telangana-RERA extends registration date to Jan.15|HYDERABAD|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Telangana State Real Estate Regulatory Authority (TS-RERA) has announced a hike in penalty of Rs. 2 lakh for all project applications received for registration after Dec.31 and if the same is done on or before Jan.15, 2019. This was decided at the meeting held a few days ago where the regulatory authority also wanted to give yet another opportunity for those who have not registered although they have had already violated the provisions of the Real Estate (Regulation & Development) RERA Act -2016, and hence, their applications were liable to be rejected. An official press release on Monday by TS-RERA Chairman and Special Chief Secretary Rajeshwar Tiwari stated that the process of registration of ongoing projects will be kept open for which permission has been taken between 1.1.2017 and 31.08.2018 from the municipal/planning authorities concerned. After the application is made by the promoter, the Authority would communicate through a pop-up notice or email and who have uploaded their application in the next 15 days asking them to pay online penalty for late registration. But, if the promoter concerned does not agree to pay the penalty, his or her application would be further processed as per the penal provisions of the RERA Act. The Act has made it mandatory on the part of the promoter to make application for ongoing projects within a period of three months from the date of commencement of TS-RERA rules. The Authority had earlier on August 31, 2018 announced a timeline to register projects before Nov. 30, 2018 online for those approved between July 1, 2017 and August 31, 2018. Mr. Rajeshwar Tiwari pointed out that the last date has already been extended twice and several show cause notices as well as press releases have been issued urging the mandatory registration of projects as the Act has stringent penal provisions too.|0|
No graft in Vizhinjam project, says Commission|THIRUVANANTHAPURAM|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|A three-member judicial commission that inquired into the pact signed by the previous United Democratic Front government with Adani Vizhinjam Ports Ltd (AVLP) for the Vizhinjam International Multipurpose Deepwater Seaport has concluded that there was ‘no corruption associated’ with the State’s dream project and that there was ‘no misuse of political power’. Giving a clean chit to Congress leader and former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy and others, the commission, headed by former judge of the High Court C.N. Ramachandran Nair, noted that no one had raised allegations against Mr. Chandy nor given any proof in this regard to the commission. Report submitted The report was handed over to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan at the Secretariat here on Monday by Mr. Nair. Former Union Secretary for Shipping K. Mohandas and P.J. Mathew, a former Indian Audit and Accounts Service officer, are the other members of the commission, appointed under the Commission of Inquiry Act. The inquiry was ordered by the LDF government against the backdrop of the observations made by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) in his report on the lapses on the part of the government while signing the pact with AVLP. CAG report The CAG’s report had mentioned that the State’s interest was not protected in the pact and that by extending the contract period of the project by 40 years, the Adani Group would gain an extra income of Rs. 29,217 crore. The commission concluded that the Union and State governments had in the initial stages come to the view that the project was not viable and that viability gap funding was provided. The viability gap funding had the nod of the erstwhile Planning Commission and there was no need for any inquiry into it. AVLP of Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ), the private multi-port operator, was selected through global bidding to build the superstructure and operate the seaport. The project work is on as per the pact and it should continue, Mr. Nair said. Flays CAG The commission is learnt to have come down heavily on the CAG report and for not seeking explanation from the officials associated with the project or hearing them. During the hearing, the commission had come out against the CAG report. Mr. Chandy, who was the Chief Minster then and had taken the lead in signing the agreement with the Adanis, had maintained that the 40-year period had been agreed as per the model PPP agreement approved by the erstwhile Planning Commission.|0|

Even as the star hotels and beach-side destinations lit up the evening with invigorating music and unlimited food, the beach-side venues remained crowd-pullers on the New Year eve. The nip in the air added to the fun as revellers gathered at RK Beach and Rushikonda to celebrate as the New Year rang in. Standalone restaurants and bakeries made brisk business with special offerings. Such was the demand that many of the eateries had long queues and special staff to handle the customers.

At The Park, Hotel Palm Beach and Vihar in Rushikonda dance performances by artistes from India and abroad, DJ music, fashion shows and fun games marked the celebrations. Hotel Novotel had multiple New Year’s eve parties happening at different spots within the premises. However, some people preferred to host house parties with their near and dear ones.

Governor visits Yadadri|Yadadri|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Governor E. S. L Narasimhan was all praise for the Yadadri Temple Development Authority here on Monday. Amazed by the erected sculptures and the gopurams at the fast-progressing project, Mr. Narasimhan, during a walk around the temple, along with District Collector Anita Ramachandran and temple officials, appreciated the work of the architects and sculptors. “It’s a great thing that the garbagriha is kept undisturbed.

Mr Subramanyam said there was enough land for the proposed university. The classes may commence from the next academic year temporarily in the existing Youth Training Centre building. The proposal to set up a tribal university in Telangana as part of AP Reorganisation Act was made by the then UPA government in 2014. Earlier, the then Chief Minister of erstwhile Andhra Pradesh, YS Rajasekhara Reddy, had proposed a tribal varsity in Bhadrachalam Agency but that did not materialise. The varsity requires a minimum of 500 acres, while land admeasuring 498 acres belonging to revenue and forest departments was available in Mulugu mandal.

4th Home Minister for Karnataka in 4 years|BENGALURU|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Home, a key portfolio in the State, has become the most rotating one among the Congress Ministers. With the last week’s reshuffle of portfolios among Congress Ministers, the State got the fourth Home Minister in four years. The Congress rotated the Home portfolio among K.J. George, G. Parameshwara, Ramalinga Reddy, and M.B. Patil during the last four years in governments headed by Siddaramaiah and H.D. Kumaraswamy. After a string of controversies, Mr. George was replaced by the then State Congress president Mr. Parameshwara on October 30, 2015. Mr. George held the portfolio for the longest period (29 months), followed by Mr. Parameshwara (20 months), and Mr. Reddy (nine months). After a long wait, Mr. Parameshwara was inducted into the Cabinet by the then Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and was allocated the Home portfolio. However, he resigned from the post following the Congress leadership’s decision to continue him as the party’s State unit chief ahead of the 2018 Assembly polls. After Mr. Parameshwara’s exit from the government, Mr. Siddaramaiah himself held the portfolio for a brief period of two months. On September 2, 2017, he allocated the portfolio to Mr. Reddy, who held the post till the formation of the new government headed by Mr. Kumaraswamy. Mr. Parameshwara, who headed the State Congress during the elections, was elevated to the Deputy Chief Minister’s post in the JD(S)-Congress government and was given the Home portfolio, besides Bengaluru Development Authority and Youth Empowerment and Sports. The significance of the portfolio came under sharp focus when Mr. Parameshwara showed unwillingness to spare it to Mr. Patil, senior Congress leader from north Karnataka. Mr. Parameshwara’s contention was that sparing the key portfolio would “diminish the weight” of the Deputy Chief Minister rank. Mr. Patil’s first official assignment after assuming charge of the Home Department was paying tribute to IPS officer the late Madhukar Shetty. As a matter of coincidence, BJP veteran L.K. Advani’s first official assignment after becoming Union Home Minister in the A.B. Vajpayee government was attending the funeral of communist leader E.M.S. Namboodiripad on March 19, 1998.|0|
Steeped in history and squalor|Hyderabad|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|A botched civic infrastructure project, lack of civic awareness and sheer indifference are turning a visit to Charminar into a filthy experience for many. On Sunday, when a bunch of visitors reached the monument for an early morning heritage walk, they were in for a surprise. They had to navigate a pool of filth and sewage flowing from the southern side of the monument. “The water keeps flowing from a distance and it turns the whole area filthy. Sometimes, the smell is awful but we have no choice but to stand here,” said Akram, who sells readymade clothes for children. By evening, the area is covered with dirty water with plastic covers, discarded by vendors like Akram, floating on it. ‘Maintenance issue’ It was only recently that the much ballyhooed pedestrianisation work near Charminar gained momentum and the four roads radiating from the monument got the cobbled stone look. However, it was not all smooth sailing as water stagnated near the southern side during monsoon forcing Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) officials to carry out emergency repair work. “This is a maintenance issue. Structurally, the gradient is perfect. The water is getting drained. If people don’t have civic sense, what can we do,” said a senior official of GHMC when asked about the issue. “It is the hotel owners and juice vendors near the Begum Masjid who pour water on the floor instead of draining it in the sewerage system. On some days, the water overflows from the Mecca Masjid as well and then the other side gets flooded,” said Hari, a conservancy worker of GHMC. On December 20, MA&UD principal secretary Arvind Kumar visited Charminar and inspected the progress of the work and tweeted about the visit. Another gentleman picked up where Mr. Kumar left off and posted a photograph of the monument from the southern side showing litter, refuse and the flowing sewage. Matter of mentality “Our officials have tried to persuade the cafe owners and juice vendors not to release dirty water onto the street but they do it when no one is seeing. We can clean up, but unless people have a civic sense, the area will not be clean,” said the GHMC worker.|0|
Two peddlers held, cocaine worth Rs. 21 lakh seized|Hyderabad|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|In the run-up to New Year, Hyderabad police on Monday busted a drug-peddling racket and arrested two persons. They also recovered 89 grams of cocaine, worth Rs. 21 lakh in the international market and three mobile phones from their possession. Acting on a tip-off, the Commissioner’s task force team of west zone apprehended Livio Joseph Almeida (34) of Goa and his local associate U. Shankar (41), a wall painter from Banjara Hills.

They were handed over to Banjara Hills police for unearthing their network with other local and foreign drug peddlers.|0|

Elevated U-turn at IFFCO Chowk to open to public today|GURUGRAM|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The elevated U-turn at IFFCO Chowk, one of the two such flyovers at the busy intersection on Delhi-Gurugram Expressway, will be opened to the public on Tuesday. It will facilitate the traffic coming from the direction of Jaipur and Old Gurugram to take U-turn and reach Mehrauli-Gurugram Road. Project Director of National Highways Authority of India, Ashok Sharma, said the U-turn flyover would be formally opened at a low-key function around 9.30 a.m. Length and cost The four-lane uni-directional flyover across National Highway-48 towards Delhi side with the length of 917 m has been built at the cost of Rs. 32.75 crore with street lights on both sides. Mr. Sharma said all signage and informality and caution signage boards were installed as per Indian Road Congress standards. The other U-turn flyover at the IFFCO Chowk towards Jaipur side was opened to traffic on November 1 last year, but the opening of the present flyover was delayed due to shifting of high tension overhead electrical wires. The opening of the elevated U-turn will reduce traffic congestion at IFFCO Chowk, one of the busiest intersections on the Delhi-Gurugram Expressway. It will also bring down the waiting time at the intersection and be a relief for commuters. The elevated U-turn was part of a project for the construction of flyovers and underpasses at four major intersections in the city — IFFCO Chowk, Signature Tower, Maharana Pratap Chowk and Rajiv Chowk — to smoothen the traffic flow on Delhi-Gurugram Expressway and between Old and New Gurugram. Though most of the project has been completed ahead of the March 31, 2019 deadline, a four-lane flyover running parallel to the existing IFFCO Chowk flyover for signal-free passage to the traffic coming from the direction of Delhi and a right-turn underpass on Mehrauli-Gurugram Road are yet to be completed. Mr. Sharma said that a 220-KV high-tension electrical line was to be shifted delaying the opening of the flyover. The shifting, he said, was to be done by construction company Gawar Constructions Limited under the supervision and direction of Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam Limited. He said that the work was likely to be completed by February-end. The underpass is stuck due to delay in shifting of a petrol pump on MG Road and the matter is sub judice over allotment of alternate plot to the pump’s owner. Haryana Sahari Vikas Pradhikaran Administrator Chander Shekhar Khare said they had moved the Supreme Court and the matter was likely to be heard in January 2019.|0|
After 13 years, High Court reopens sodomy case of seven-year-old boy|New Delhi|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The failing grades of a seven-year-old boy was implied by the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) here that his word cannot be believed when he accused three of his seniors of sodomising him repeatedly in the school bathroom. Unable to come out of the trauma of having been dubbed as a liar, the boy, now a 20-year-old man knocked the doors of the Delhi High Court challenging the acquittal of all three senior students in the case. The incident allegedly happened when the victim was studying in Class III of a private school in north Delhi in 2005. When the boy told his teacher about it, she had instead beaten him up. Feeling afraid, he did not disclose the incident to anyone. Following this, the three seniors continued to subject him to similar acts of sodomy on several occasions with threats that they would throw him into a drain if he told anyone about the incident. The mother had found the boy in a depressed state and after his father was also brought in the loop, the child spoke out. An FIR was registered on September 5, 2005, but the JJB took over six years to decide the case in favour of the three accused students. ‘Creating a doubt’ The Board noted that the accused student’s counsel was successful in creating a “doubt” that the complaint was filed by the victim’s parents to save the child from getting dismissed from the school due to his poor performance. As the State did not challenge the Board’s judgment, the victim moved a trial court here, which dismissed his plea in May 2016. He then moved the High Court. The victim’s grievance is that despite incriminating evidence against the three seniors, he was termed as a person whose word could not be relied upon. This, his plea said, was “an insult to the injuries suffered”. In its verdict, the High Court Bench of Justice R.K. Gauba said the Board failed to judge the case on the touchstone of the psychology of the child who may have suffered sexual abuse. The judge remarked that the child’s lack of interest in attending school, disinterest in studies and resultantly his poor performance, needs to be examined from all angles since it may conversely be indicative of trauma of the child due to the sexual abuse. “A child victim of sexual abuse cannot be expected to conduct himself in a normal or healthy manner in school which, in his mind, is no longer a place of safety,” the judge said. “The manner in which the JJB in this case dealt with the responsibility of appreciating the evidence smacks of total disconnect with the specialized field of child psychology,” the judge said. The court remarked that only such Magistrates should be appointed as members of the Board who possess “special knowledge or training in child psychology or child welfare”. It also directed the Board to re-open the case and decide afresh within three months.|0|

SCCL to step up production|HYDERABAD|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) has stepped up its efforts to increase coal production from its existing mines with their expansion, as well as by going for new mines, keeping in mind the ever-increasing demand for carbon-fuel from power, cement, iron and steel and other industries. The declaration of commercial operation of the 800 mw super critical unit of the Kothagudem Thermal Power Station (KTPS) on December 26 alone would add the coal supply demand of 4 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) for the company. The expected increase in the demand from agriculture sector for the cultivation of Rabi crops and the forthcoming summer season would also add to the demand from power sector. New mines As such, the SCCL is planning to commence coal production at least in seven new mines during 2019-20 to meet the increasing demand. The new mines planned for production include Kistaram Open Cast (OC), J.V.R. OC, Manuguru OC-2, Indaram OC, Sravanapalli OC, RG-I OC-5 and K.T.K. OC-3. “We are required to continue supplement coal of 4.8 MTPA to our own 2×600 mw Singerni Thermal Power Plant and when the super critical expansion unit of 800 mw goes on commercial production, possibly by the end of 2019-20, we may have to meet another 4.05 MTPA coal from our own production. The existing and upcoming units of the power plant are tied up with coal from Naini Block in Odisha but production there is expected only towards the end of 2020-21,” a senior official of SCCL explained.  Temporary setback The company's plans to add production of 2 MTPA from Kistaram mines from early 2019-20 suffered a temporary setback recently when an expert committee of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) held back its recommendation for environmental clearance for the project citing “non-compliance of the conditions stipulated in the Stage-I forest clearance given to it on September 11, 2018”. By expanding the Shantikhani under ground (UG) longwall project, the company is planning to raise the coal production there from 1.67 MTPA to 1.80 MTPA. However, the MoEF panel which met during the second week of December did not grant it the terms of reference as part of the process for environmental clearance citing shortcomings in the proposal.  Target fixed Meanwhile, the Singareni management has fixed itself a target of reaching 85 million tonnes of coal production by the end of 2022-23 from 62.01 million tonnes achieved in 2017-18. The upcoming demand includes requirement of 7 MTPA from Singareni for 5×800 mw Yadadri Thermal Power Station, which also needs import of another 7 MTPA coal, when all five units reach commercial generation stage.|0|

Air quality likely to worsen: authorities|New Delhi|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Pollution in Delhi spiked to ‘severe’ category on New Year’s eve, prompting authorities to warn people that any increase in vehicular pollutants or burning of firecrackers may worsen air quality to emergency level. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data on Monday showed that the city recorded an overall air quality index (AQI) of 418, while the Centre-run System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting (SAFAR) recorded an AQI of 430, both come under the ‘severe’ category. According to the CPCB data, 25 areas in the national capital recorded ‘severe’ pollution, while nine witnessed ‘very poor’ air quality. In the NCR, Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Gurgaon, Greater Noida and Noida recorded ‘severe’ air quality. The overall PM2.5 level (fine particulate matter in the air with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometre) was recorded at 324 and the PM10 level at 481 in Delhi, the CPCB said.  May improve The SAFAR said the air quality may improve slightly “provided that no additional local emissions are added on New Year’s eve”. “Any new trigger in terms of additional local emission, particularly from open fire, pyrotechnic display and fossil fuel burning may make the air heavier, thicker, with low ventilation and may lead to rapid deterioration in air quality further to severe-plus range,” the SAFAR said in its New Year’s forecast. It said that the air quality over Delhi is in ‘severe’ category and is likely to remain in the severe zone for the next two days as weather conditions are more adverse now.|0|

‘Tyre killers’ to stop wrong-lane driving|Noida|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|In order to prevent wrong-lane driving, Noida will soon have “tyre killers” on city roads, a first-of-its-kind experiment in UP, officials said. Tyre killers are metal strips installed on roads with sharp spikes on one side. They act as minor speed breakers for those in the correct lane, while the tyres of vehicles in the wrong lane get punctured. Five crucial junctures have been identified for installation of the tyre killers. The first one at Sector 77 — North Eye Junction, a densely populated area with several high rise apartments — will be operational by Thursday, a senior Noida Authority official said. “Tyre killers will also be installed at the Hoshiarpur U-turn, Sector 61 Sai temple U-turn, near Sector 76 metro station and near Sector 16 A flyover,” Noida Authority General Manager Rajeev Tyagi said.

BPCL plans pipeline to augment fuel supplies|HYDERABAD|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) is planning an over 450-km petro product pipeline from Krishnapatnam in Andhra Pradesh to Hyderabad, a facility to augment fuel supplies in one of the fast, industrially developing areas. The State-owned firm had submitted an expression of interest, as required of entities proposing such projects, recently to Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB). The pipeline, estimated to be 455-km. long, is expected to deliver multiple benefits. Serving as backbone for BPCL to grow its market in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, it will reduce the dependence on Hindustan Petroleum Corporation’s Vishakapatnam refinery and 572-km long, 5.38 million tonne Vizag-Vijayawada-Secunderabad pipeline. Both BPCL and IOC rely heavily on HPCL refinery and pipeline to supply petrol, diesel and kerosene in Telangana. Indian Oil Corporation is also laying a product pipeline from its Paradip refinery in Odisha to Hyderabad. The Krishnapatnam-Hyderabad pipeline through Ongole in Andhra Pradesh will be crucial for utilising the enhanced capacity of BPCL’s refinery in Kochi, Kerala. A BPCL official, who did not wish to be identified, said evacuation of products has assumed greater significance post the integrated refinery expansion project in Kochi that took the capacity to 15.5 million tonne from 12.4 MT. Coastal movement Thus, the plan of the company is to move the products, primarily petrol and diesel, coastally from Kochi to Krishnapatnam and from there onwards use the pipeline. Other options such as sourcing products from its Mumbai refinery or import them will also be available. Such pipelines are an efficient, faster alternative to movement of products by road and help cut down on carbon footprint. At Krishnapatnam port, BPCL has already set in motion the process of establishing a coastal POL terminal with an estimated investment of around Rs. 700 crore. The investment estimates for the pipeline were being worked out, the official said, adding the proposed facility would help maintain and enhance supply of products. “Supply for this area is always a problem for BPCL. That will get resolved,” he said. The company proposes to set up a POL terminal in Hyderabad, while the pipeline would connect the existing POL depot in Ongole. Bharat Petroleum estimates the demand for white oil petroleum products, supplied through its facilities in Ongole and Hyderabad, to be 1500 thousand metric tonnes per annum in 2022-23 and 1700 TMTPA in 2025-26. The volume proposed to be moved over the pipeline is 1875 TMTPA and 2125 TMTPA respectively.|0|

Prof files complaint against JNUTA head, JNUSU secy|new delhi|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|A woman professor of the Jawaharlal Nehru University has filed a police complaint against JNUTA president Atul Sood and the JNUSU secretary for allegedly circulating fake news and trying to disturb peace, communal harmony and incite violence and divisiveness on the campus. Aejaz Ahmed Rather, JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU) secretary, claimed that the complainant, Professor Amita Singh of the Centre for the Study of Law and Governance, had told him he looked like “a terrorist who has triggered 10 bomb blasts”, on December 26. In a statement, the JNU Teachers’ Association (JNUTA) had condemned Ms. Singh for her alleged statement and demanded a formal inquiry into the matter. Mr. Rather said he had submitted a complaint to the Delhi Minorities Commission and the National Commission For Minorities in this regard. Prof. Singh claimed that Mr. Rather, accompanied by some students, including JNUSU president N. Sai Balaji, protested outside her office on Monday, raising slogans like “Please teach them Lenin, Marx”. She said before the protest, she had written to the university’s Vice-Chancellor, apprising him of the matter and demanding security. Prof. Singh also said she had written to the V-C on December 29 against the JNUTA president for “maligning her reputation”. “Reiterating the hollowed allegation that I called them terrorists or blast convicts when I do not know them at all only shows that this is a well-planned conspiracy to create disturbances, obstruct work and arouse communal passions on the campus, especially by using the ‘Islamophobia’ argument, which is a sensitive issue in this pre-election phase of the capital city,” she had written in the December 29 letter. After Monday’s protest, Ms. Singh also filed a police complaint in the matter.  Staged protest Mr. Rather admitted that they staged a protest outside Ms. Singh’s office on Monday, but claimed that no threatening slogan was raised, only slogans like “Inquilab Zindabad”, “Casteism and Islamophobia won’t work in JNU” were shouted.

Two arrested for importing narcotics from United States|NEW DELHI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Two persons have been arrested for allegedly importing marijuana extracts from the USA and selling it in the country, the police said on Monday. The accused had been ordering contraband using the dark web, they said. Additional Commissioner of Police (Crime) Rajiv Ranjan said that the accused have been identified as Sahil Kadiyan (25) and Ridham Gulati (22). A total of 7.05 kg marijuana and 50 g of malana cream charas were seized from their possession. Tip-off The police said that they were informed that some people were involved in illegal import of marijuana, including shatters and cannabis wax from the USA. Acting on a tip-off that on December 12 Sahil and Ridham would come to a courier services branch in Moti Nagar to collect a consignment, the police laid a trap and arrested them after they took the delivery. “During search, five cartons, including gift packs were found. When the gift packs were opened, three packets of 470 g each, all filled with marijuana, were found,” Mr. Ranjan said, adding that the accused’s 10-day police custody was sought to unearth the nexus. The police said that on December 28, based on their disclosure statements, they seized one more carton with three packets of imported marijuana, 26 shatters and 50 g of cannabis wax from the courier service in Moti Nagar as it got delivered. On Monday, the police said, three other cartons were seized from custom bonded area of a courier company at the IGI Airport. The cartons contained similar contraband. Mr. Ranjan said that the accused had imported drugs for upcoming New Year parties. “Sahil started consuming charas and ganja about four years ago and used to procure the same from Subhash Nagar. He came in touch with a Model Town resident who told him about importing drugs from the USA using the dark web,” the officer said. On dark web, one can use networks like Tor, but it can be accessed only with specific software, configurations, or authorisation. The payment for drugs is made in advance through bitcoins, identities remain anonymous and the address for shipment is shared. The police said that cannabis extracts which include shatter, wax, errl, oil, resin or dabs are the latest trend. Marijuana wax, which looks like bee wax or earwax, costs Rs. 1 lakh per 50 g. Shatter looks like glass and costs Rs. 50,000 per 500 g. Mr. Ranjan also said, “The seized contraband was packed in five layers of high-quality polythenes to evade detection from X-rays and perfumes were sprayed to conceal the smell of the contraband.”|0|

Hearing on plea in SC likely tomorrow|NEW DELHI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Andhra Pradesh High Court Advocates Association in Hyderabad on Monday moved a petition in the Supreme Court to defer the implementation of a notification, issued on December 26, bifurcating the Hyderabad High Court into the new Andhra Pradesh and Telangana High Courts. As per the notification, the two separate high courts have to start functioning from January 1. The petition is likely to be listed for hearing before the Supreme Court on January 2. The petition urged the court to delay the bifurcation till the new premises for the Andhra High Court in the capital city of Amaravati is completed. The high court is now set to function from temporary premises till the construction work is over. The petition sought urgent orders and said the plea would be rendered infructuous if the two high courts were allowed to function from January 1. The petition comes despite the fact that Andhra had informed the Supreme Court that the judges, who would preside over the courtrooms of the new high court, were satisfied with the facilities in an interim building complex which would house the high court till a permanent building was constructed. The State government had submitted that a Full Court of the High Court approved the proposal after the inspection committee of judges submitted a report. Senior advocate Fali Nariman for Andhra Pradesh had made a statement that the government would be hiring villas to take care of the residential needs of the judges at Amaravati. The court had taken on record the submissions made by the Andhra government that a “very big complex known as 'Justice City' is under construction” in Amaravati. This complex would house the high court, subordinate courts and even some tribunals.It would also have a provision for construction of residential complex for the high court and lower courts’ judges. The interim building for the AP High Court, the apex court recorded, is only an “ad hoc arrangement till the Justice City gets completely constructed”.|0|

Cong has always encouraged corruption, says Tiwari|New delhi|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Accusing it of having “committed corruption from Earth to space” Delhi BJP chief and the party’s MP from north-east Delhi, Manoj Tiwari on Monday attacked the Congress over the Agusta Westland deal. Mr. Tiwari attempted to corner the party in the wake of “revelations” made by Christian Michel regarding the involvement of “a big man, the son of an Italian lady and ‘R’” as per the Enforcement Directorate’s (ED) submissions to the Delhi’s Patiala House Court. “The Congress party has always encouraged corruption. The Congress government under Sonia-Manmohan-Rahul Gandhi was the government of scamsters... and committed corruption everywhere from Earth to Space,” Mr. Tiwari said, adding that it “never concluded a defence deal without the middle man”. “Everybody knows about the involvement of the Congress party in the Bofors scam and now it has done the same thing in the Agusta Wasteland VVIP helicopter deal and played with the security of the nation,” he alleged further. Mr. Tiwari, citing Michel’s allegations, termed these “a direct allegation on the top leadership of the Congress party”. “Prime Minister Narender Modi’s government is committed to working on the policy of zero tolerance against corruption... The Congress party tried to suppress this case again and again and tried to hide Michel so that the involvement of big leaders may not be exposed but the Modi government succeeded in the extradition of Michel from Dubai,” he argued. ‘BJP demands probe’ Citing the ED’s submission to the court on December 29, Mr. Tiwari said that the Delhi BJP demands an ED investigation into the involvement of a person named ‘R’ in the deal so that the “real face of the Congress party in betraying the country may be exposed” before the people.|0|

All-India Sociological Conference begins|MYSURU|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Sociologist and scholar Gail Omvedt said on Thursday that the world was going through a period of turmoil, with democracies being trampled by the State in various countries. She was speaking on the first day of the 44th All-India Sociological Conference at St. Philomena’s College here. Prof. Omvedt said sociologists should find out the reason for this condition. “Sociologists should adopt a multi-disciplinary approach based on the relationship between humans and nature, women’s liberation, non-class relations such as caste, race and gender, along with class and culture. The contribution of Mahatma Phule, B.R. Ambedkar, and Periyar should be integrated into the theoretical discourse,” she added. Earlier in the day, Margaret Abraham, professor of sociology, Hofstra University, New York, in her address, stressed importance of providing perspectives from the margins in knowledge production and sociological engagements. She said there is a critical need to examine issues of inequality and injustice. The theme of the three-day meet is ‘Reconstructing Sociological Discourse in India: Perspectives from the Margins’.|0|

She then approached the insurance ombudsman, who in October 2013 directed the insurance company to settle the claim. Thereafter, the company paid her the claimed amount of Rs. 1.67 lakh. After encashing the amount, she wrote a letter to the company seeking interest on the reimbursement due to delay. When the company refused to pay the interest amount, she filed a consumer complaint. “The opponent (insurance company) has not produced any document on record to show that the complainant had received the amount of Rs. 1,67,152 towards full and final satisfaction of her claim waiving her right to get interest on that amount along with costs and compensation,” the court order said.   The panel ordered the insurance company to pay the woman interest at the rate of nine per cent from April 2011 to December 2013, adding that this amount will have to be paid within two months.|0|

The action followed after the BMC and fire brigade inspected 377 establishments for fire safety compliance in the last four days. Joint inspections For the past month, the BMC and fire brigade have cranked up fire safety inspections at residential and commercial premises. The municipal commissioner had given orders to this effect ahead of the first anniversary of the Kamala Mills Compound tragedy on December 29 and New Year’s Eve celebrations. In the four days up to Monday, the teams inspected 377 establishments across 24 wards. They found violations in 31 of those, which included encroachment or obstacles to fire exits and excessive storage of LPG cylinders. “Some violations were found despite stringent directives issued weeks ago. Demolition was done by the ward authorities for encroachment or alterations, while LPG cylinders were seized under Section 4 of the Fire Act,” Chief Fire Officer P.S. Rahangdale said. One of the most prominent establishments where violations were found was Bar Stock Exchange inside Kamala Mills premises. “On Saturday, we found that they had created a seating facility on the rooftop. The establishment did not have a licence under the rooftop policy. That is why we issued a notice, and the seating was removed on Sunday,” Dr. Devendra Golhar, Medical Officer of Health, G South ward, said. Other prominent spots The other prominent establishments that faced action included Wilson, Catholic and Mafatlal gymkhanas on Marine Drive, Neel Yog Mall in Ghatkopar, Maratha Mandal and Samruddhi Hall in Mulund. “About 17 LPG cylinders have been seized from my ward as they were in excess of the permissible limit and could be be a fire hazard,” V.P.

Builder attacked in court|Navi Mumbai|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|A builder based in Seawood was attacked and his throat was slit by two unidentified men inside the Judicial Magistrate First Class court in CBD Belapur on Monday. The incident took place when Narendra Patel (32) went for the hearing of a civil dispute case, in which he is the applicant. “At 12 p.m., he visited the washroom on the fifth floor of the court when unidentified men attacked him from behind and slit his throat,” said Tushar Doshi, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Crime Branch. In the scuffle, the accused dropped their knife and fled. Mr. Patel then made a WhatsApp video call to a friend who was present on the court premises. With the help of the NRI police at the court, the friend rushed Mr. Patel to Apollo Hospital. Mr. Doshi said, “He is out of danger and has given his statement. We have registered a case with the CBD Belapur police. There is an ongoing case with the Economic Offences Wing-II, where Mr. Patel is the complainant and the accused are two real estate agents, who are in jail. Mr. Patel alleged that the accused in the case might have planned the attack.” The lack of CCTVs on the court premises has hampered the probe. Mr. Patel had lodged a case against Prabhakar Mhatre (45) and Lavesh Jadhav (35) after being cheated of Rs. 1.45 crore by them in a CIDCO plot deal. The accused threatened to kill Mr. Patel at his office before being arrested in November 2017. “Mr. Patel has seen the face of the accused,” Mr. Doshi said. A case against the accused has been registered under Sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.|0|

2019: low on long weekends, but high on holiday options|Mumbai|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|With only 11 long weekends, 2019 will have the least holidays since 2015, which had 14 long breaks. However, travel agents say the statistic won’t be a dampener as tourists look for out-of-the box trips. Heena J. Akhtar, co-founder of TripXOXO, said, “2019 gives travellers an opportunity to plan trips in advance. Though the number of long weekend holidays is fewer, it won’t stop travellers from planning a great trip.” Ms. Akhtar said a large number of people are excited to take part in grand festivals such as the Kumbh Mela, the Pushkar festival and the Kite festival. She said, “It is not about the number of destinations they are covering. It is about experiencing something out of the box. Travellers are also interested in natural trails and adventure activities.” Bungee jumping in Rishikesh, an excursion tour in Rajgir and Nalanda in Bihar, camping in Shimla, village trips in Sikkim, bike rides to Ladhak are considered the most sought-after by tourists. Aloke Bajpai, CEO and co-founder of ixigo, said the fewer the number of long weekends, the more frequent will be the trips planned. Mr. Bajpai said, “Weekend vacations dominated the year with 15 long weekends in 2018. Short vacations peaked during monsoon, which is the ideal time for extended weekend getaways, especially for millennial working couples. For the long weekends in 2019, travellers will have to plan their vacations smartly.” Mr. Bajpai said by tweaking two to three leaves, travellers can enjoy extended vacations in August and April, the months with the highest number of holidays in the year. He said, “Families and working professionals can plan short vacations to destinations like Kerala, Puducherry, Lonavala, Coorg and Srinagar, which are perfect to visit at that time of the year.”|0|

Cong. takes a leaf out of BJP’s book in M.P.|Bhopal|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Playing the soft-Hindutva card, the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh has decided to create a separate department to woo Hindu voters, who are traditionally seen as the vote bank of the BJP, ahead of the crucial general election in 2019. The new Spiritual Department will be created by merging the Religious Trusts and Endowments Department and the Happiness Department, the two popular departments of the previous BJP government led by Shivraj Singh Chouhan that ruled the State for 15 years. The Directorate of Religious Trusts and Endowments, Pilgrimage and Fair Authority; Directorate of Mukhyamantri Teerth Darshan Yojana and the Rajya Anand Sansthan will also be included in the new department, an official said on Monday.

After Malegaon drug bust, FDA intensifies probe|Mumbai|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|A recently busted multi-State racket of sedative drug alprazolam in Malegaon has prompted the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to intensify its investigation across Maharashtra. The top priority for FDA officials is to break the alternative logistics channel created by the accused, which involved purchase and sale of the drug through mobile networking. Worryingly, officials believe that most of the illegal consumers are in the age group of 15 to 25 years. Alprazolam falls under the benzodiazepine class of drugs. It is mainly prescribed for anxiety disorders, and diabetes and hypertension in some cases. It is widely abused for its calming effects. “The illegal sale of such drugs is not dependent on shops any more. When we investigated this racket, we realised that the criminals have created their own network through which they purchase the drugs and sell directly to the youngsters,” Pravin Mundada, Assistant Commissioner (Drugs), Nashik, said. In the Malegaon racket, the FDA has filed seven First Information Reports (FIRs) and arrested nine people so far. The ninth arrest in the case was made early in December. The arrested accused, Ahmed Abdul Ghani, would allegedly procure the drug from Surat and bring it to Malegaon. The drug was then sold to handloom workers and other youngsters in the area. Investigations revealed that the sedatives were coming from Himachal Pradesh to Gujarat and then to Malegaon. The Maharashtra FDA has written to its counterparts in Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat and to the Drug Controller General of India, alerting them of the racket which may have spread across other States as well. “During our investigations, we inspected 33 chemist shops in Malegaon to find out if the illegal sale was being conducted through the shops. But it turned out that none of the shops stocked the drug made by the Himachal Pradesh-based firm,” Mr. Mundada said. This prompted the suspicion about the existence of an alternative channel. Following the arrests, the FDA has called for meetings of over 500 chemists and 130 wholesalers, requesting them to chart out a plan to stock the sedative drug only in certain shops. The FDA has also written to doctors’ bodies, requesting them to prescribe substitutes of the drug. “We are taking several measures so that the illegal sales are completely stopped and all the possible avenues of abuse are shut,” Mr. Mundada said.|0|
Two held with cache of sophisticated weapons|Mumbai|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Thane Police Crime Branch has seized a large cache of sophisticated weapons from two accused allegedly working for a major arms dealer in the State. The main accused, for whom the trap was laid, is still absconding. Thane Crime Branch officers said its Unit I conducted the operation on the basis of a tip off, which was linked to a case registered by the Shil Diaghar police station earlier this year. Sophisticated factory-made pistols and ammunition had been seized from two accused in the case. During interrogation they said the arsenal was being delivered at the behest of a suspect identified only as Mukesh. A Thane Crime Branch officer said, “Our information indicated that Mukesh was active in the State and willing to sell weapons and ammunition to interested parties. We instructed an informant to contact him posing as a customer. After several rounds of calls, Mukesh agreed to meet him in Amravati on December 29.” The officer said the meeting was fixed for 5 p.m. at Sheetal Lodging and Pancham Restaurant, which is located between Amravati station and bus stop. Unit I officers in plainclothes laid a trap and detained two suspects who reached the hotel at the specified time and approached the decoy customer. A search of their handbag revealed 10 factory-made pistols of superior quality and 40 rounds of 7.65 mm ammunition. “We suspect Mukesh himself was also in the vicinity but got wind of our trap and fled the scene. Efforts are on to trace and apprehend him,” a Unit I officer, who was part of the operation, said. The two suspects, identified as Shoaib Sheikh (21) and Rahim Sheikh (32), both residents of Amravati, were arrested and brought to Thane for nquiries. They were charged under the Arms Act and have been remanded in police custody till January 7, 2019. The Unit I officer said, “Shoaib is unemployed, while Rahim is a carpenter. We suspect that Mukesh has an intra-State network and employs locals in need of a quick buck to make his deliveries. Inquiries indicate that the weapons have been sourced from an illegal arms factory on the Maharashtra–Madhya Pradesh border,” The high quality of the weapons, nearly as good as legally manufactured firearms, have raised concerns in the police department. On Monday afternoon, a team from the Maharashta Anti Terrorism Squad reached the Unit I office in Thane to interrogate the accused about the source of the arsenal and the scope of their racket.|0|

Six killed in two accidents in Odisha|BERHAMPUR|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Four persons died and two were seriously injured when the four-wheeler they were travelling in met with an accident in Kashipur block of Odisha’s Rayagada district on Sunday night. The accident occurred at 1 a.m. near Tayaput under the Tikiri police station limits. According to the police, perhaps due to dense fog, the driver of the SUV lost control and rammed a roadside tree.

Tripura resumes trade with Bangladesh|Agartala|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Tripura resumed trade with Bangladesh on Monday following a two-day hiatus at the check posts in view of elections in the neighbouring country, an official said. Bangladesh went to polls on Sunday to elect a new Parliament, the results of which were declared on Monday morning. The ruling Awami League-led alliance cruised to victory, bagging 260 seats in the 300-member House.

‘Big gap in projected, actual collections at toll nakas’|Mumbai|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|A study of toll nakas at major thoroughfares in the State by the Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Calcutta has revealed a massive gap in projected and actual toll collections. The burgeoning gap raises serious questions on the quality of roads being built and maintained, and execution of PPP (Public Private Partnership) projects. Projects terminated The study was conducted on select major PPP projects, including highways in Mumbai, Thane, Nashik, Ahmednagar, Aurangabad, Nagpur and Amravati. A financial assessment, gap analysis and an inventory survey were conducted apart from interviews of private players and the State government staff. Since 1996, Maharashtra has terminated 65 PPP projects with an investment worth Rs. 77,000 crore. The State along with Chhattisgarh and Gujarat are the top three States to terminate the maximum PPP projects undertaken on a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) basis. Overall, it was found there was a 40% to 50% gap between projection and present collections in the six projects studied. The inventory survey revealed the toll managers and employees were not aware of the key features of the agreement with the government. “It is concluded no one is aware of the proposal and key features of the agreement with the State government and do not know scope of the work and what is to be done,” said the study, assigned by the Directorate of Economics and Statistics. The study covered big toll nakas on the Sion Panvel Road, Malkapur-Buldhana-Chikli Road, Ahmednagar-Aurangabad Highway, Nanded-Naresee Highway, Anjura Fata Highway, Maankoli Highway, and Chandrapur-Vamni Road. The study found toll operators “did not cheat in road length but the pave of most shoulders” were in poor condition. “Some of the tolls had failed because the toll charges remained heavy, and insufficient traffic resulting from the efforts to recover costs,” the report has said. Senior officials said toll and work on these roads were awarded in 2011 but the renewal work has not been completed. “Though the paved condition is not to international standards, with the exception of a few pockets, the general condition is fairly good. We are confident about it,” said a senior official of the State Public Works Department. Serious concerns The study found that in most places the private toll operators have engaged “amateur” service providers for the purpose of maintenance. “The study provides an analysis and evaluation of the current and prospective profitability and other financial attributes of the PPP projects. The report finds prospects of the work done in its current status is not positive and some major areas of weakness require further intervention action by the government.” The study has raised questions on the government’s preparedness for preventing road fatalities. According to the Road Accidents in India 2017 report prepared by the Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, four cities — Mumbai, Pune, Nashik and Nagpur — feature in the top 50. In Mumbai, 3,160 accidents occurred in 2017, of which 467 were fatal and 2,603 caused injury. A total of 490 people died in these accidents while as many as 3,287 were injured.|0|

With key infra, Panvel on its way to becoming a growth centre|Navi Mumbai|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|While inaugurating the first phase of the Nerul-Uran railway line in November, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis had said Panvel will become the next important terminus like Dadar or CSMT. Situated at the periphery of Navi Mumbai, Panvel is fast turning into a new growth centre in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. Some of the key infrastructure projects expected to come up in near future here include the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link, the Navi Mumbai International Airport and the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT)- Panvel fast corridor. Over Rs. 56,000 crore is being spent on different forms of infrastructure to connect the area by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), the City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) and the Mumbai Rail Vikas Corporation (MRVC) — the new Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) being the largest and the most influential of them all. First phase of airport CIDCO officials said they are trying to commission the first phase of the new airport, spread across over 2,000 hectares, by December 2019, which includes a terminal building and a runway. The total project cost is presently pegged at Rs. 16,450 crore. “As much as 65% land development work will be over by January and a contractor will soon be appointed to build the terminal building and runway,” CIDCO MD Lokesh Chandra said. The airport has, in turn, created the need for other transportation infrastructure to be planned in the region. For instance, the closest train station to the proposed new airport will be Targhar on the newly inaugurated Phase I of the Nerul-Uran line. The proposed elevated fast corridor between CSMT and Panvel has also been planned with a spur line to the airport. There is a proposal to include Targhar as one of the stations on the spur line. The project is part of the ambitious Rs. 54,777 crore Mumbai Urban Transport Project 3A (MUTP - 3A), which got State government sanction earlier this month. Mr. Chandra said Targhar station will be completed soon and will provide seamless connectivity from the airport to the Harbour Line and the fast corridor. Moreover, the fast corridor will be built along Metro standards, and will have a connection to the Metro network being developed by MMRDA at Mandala in Mankhurd. Metro Line 8 connecting the CSMT and NMIA is being planned to connect with the fast corridor at Mankhurd. The detailed project report for the Metro line is still being prepared. Situated at the junction of roads that connect Mumbai, Goa and Pune, Panvel is also a key station on the Konkan Railway route. While the detailed project report of the CSMT-Panvel fast corridor is under approval, the Karjat-Panvel corridor under Mumbai Urban Transport Project 3 (MUTP-3) has been sanctioned and preliminary works are under way. “The line has huge potential to connect the areas between Karjat and Panvel along the old Mumbai-Pune highway by rail. Once constructed, Panvel and adjoining regions will be connected to Pune by rail via Karjat,” Sanjay Singh, Executive Director (Planning), MRVC, said. The combination of the two projects will also reduce the travel time from Karjat and adjoining areas to CSMT. Looking at the developments happening around here, many consider this to be the best time to invest in Panvel. Real estate haven “Backed by sound and well-planned physical infrastructure, Panvel has emerged as one of the perfect affordable alternatives to several areas in Mumbai where prices have skyrocketed over the years. It is well-connected and easily accessible to major areas in the MMR via the Sion-Panvel Highway, Mumbai suburban railway, NH 66 and NH 48. The upcoming projects are major infrastructure projects driving real estate growth in recent times,” Prashant Thakur, head (research), ANAROCK Property Consultants, said. Mr. Thakur said another factor driving residential growth in Panvel is its proximity to major commercial areas in Navi Mumbai, including Koparkhairaine, Airoli and Taloja. As per data from ANAROCK, as many as 28,480 new units have been launched in Panvel since 2013. “Interestingly, 2013 saw maximum new unit launches as it was widely anticipated that NMIA construction would begin. But land acquisition issues delayed the project and the final nod was given only in late 2017,” Mr. Thakur said. The residential segment in Panvel has witnessed a boom, with many big developers coming up with townships and lucrative projects. “There is a substantial change in the city in the last five years. I believe Panvel must be having the largest infrastructure developments, the airport being the most important,” Mayur Shah, managing director from construction company Marathon Group, said. Mr. Shah said Panvel’s connectivity to Uran and JNPT is also driving demand in the region. “With some partially commissioned and some proposed projects, there is a huge investment being made on connectivity of Panvel with Raigad and Mumbai,” he said. Mr. Shah saidin the last five years, real estate prices have doubled. “We started our project with a rate of Rs. 3,500 per sq.ft., and now it is Rs. 6,500 per sq.ft. There is open land available in Panvel and hence affordable housing projects are being initiated. After the airport becomes operational, there will be employment for at least one lakh people, and the demand for residential and commercial space will increase,” he said. “ Considering the upcoming infra projects in Panvel, one can expect 12-15% growth in prices over the next four to five years.” Mr. Thakur said.|0|
Patnaik’s New Year gift to Odisha farmers|BHUBANESWAR|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik launched the Krushak Assistance for Livelihood and Income Augmentation (KALIA) scheme to accelerate agricultural prosperity and to reduce poverty in Odisha on the New Year Eve on Monday. The scheme,announced on December 21, will cover 92% of the cultivators, loanee and non-loanee farmers, sharecroppers and landless agricultural labourers. Mr. Patnaik released the logo and website of the scheme, a list of 21.40 lakh small farmers and a draft farmers’ benefit list of one lakh actual farmers. He urged the Departments of Agriculture, Cooperation and Panchayati Raj to work in mission mode to ensure that not a single farmer was left out in the scheme. To begin with, the farmers will be provided Rs. 5,000 each to take care of the initial investment for the current Rabi season. In a full year, all the small and marginal farmers will receive Rs. 10,000 for Kharif and Rabi combined. The final list of all beneficiaries will be prepared in the next phase from the gram panchayat level. The farmers can know about details of the KALIA scheme during the People’s Empowerment – Enabling Transparency and Accountability (PEETHA) camps being organised between January 15 and January 20 at gram panchayat level. The PEETHA camp also will be organised from February 15 to 20 and from March 15 to 20, 2019. The letters about extension of financial assistance to eligible small and marginal farmers will also be handed over during the PEETHA camp. The State level committee, Implementation committee, District level committee and Block level committee have been formed for monitoring and overseeing smooth implementation of the scheme. As regards landless agricultural households, financial assistance of Rs. 12,500 will be provided to each for agricultural allied activities such as small goat rearing unit, mini-layer unit, duckery units, fishery kits for fisherman, mushroom cultivation and bee-keeping etc. Besides, the vulnerable cultivators/landless agricultural labourers will get financial assistance of Rs. 10,000 per family per year to enable them to take care of their sustenance. An amount of Rs. 10,180 crore will be spent under KALIA over a period of three years till 2020-211. Crop loans up to Rs. 50,000 will henceforth be interest free. Night meal Meanwhile, Mr. Patnaik inaugurated the night meal facility at as many as 54 Aahar centres located near government hospitals across the State.

2 held with ephedrine worth Rs. 3 cr.|Mumbai|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Amboli police on Sunday arrested two hisory-sheeters with a massive stash of ephedrine, which was allegedly meant to be supplied for New Year’s Eve parties in the western suburbs. According to the police, the two men were arrested on the basis of a tip-off received by police inspector Daya Nayak, in the early hours of Sunday. Officers said Mr. Nayak and his team laid a trap on Agarwal Estate Road and picked up Muhammad Ismail Gulamhussain (45) and Dayanand Manik Muddanar (32), natives of Hyderabad and Palghar respectively. “They were found to be carrying 20 kg of ephedrine, worth Rs. 3.40 crore, and were placed under arrest. Ephedrine is generally consumed with ice as a drug in parties, and the seized drugs were meant to be supplied for New Year’s Eve parties,” Additional Commissioner of Police Dr. Manoj Kumar Sharma, West region, said. Ephedrine, a stimulant, is a party drug that stimulates the brain and increases the heart rate, metabolism and body heat. Mr. Gulamhussain and Mr. Muddanar, who have been charged under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, are history-sheeters suspected of specialising in supplying drugs in bulk. “They were arrested in 2013 after being caught with 200 kg of ephedrine in Hyderabad by the Narcotic Control Bureau. They were released on bail in 2015 and got back into the drug dealing circuit. The quantity of drugs seized from them indicates that they have direct links with factories that illegally manufacture drugs in bulk,” an officer who is part of the investigation said. The officer said that according to inquiries so far, the men had made a deal with a Mumbai-based drug dealer who supplies narcotics to major parties. The police are trying to identify and apprehend the dealer, and are interrogating the accused to find out the source of the drugs.|0|
Hold rallies after Jan. 2, minister tells Azad|Mumbai|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Maharashtra’s Minister of State for Home Deepak Kesarkar on Monday defended the detaining of Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad by the police in Mumbai and denial of permission for a rally in Pune. “He (Azad) can come to Maharashtra anytime after January 2 and hold as many rallies as he wants. We will not stop him. But one must understand that considering last year’se incident, the top priority of the police authorities is to maintain law and order. They have acted accordingly,” said Mr. Kesarkar. On January 1 last year, riots broke out in Bhima Koregaon after thousands of people — largely from Dalit community — who had gathered to pay respects at the victory memorial to the Mahar soldiers who fought with British to defeat the Brahminical Peshwa regime, clashed with right-wing Hindutva groups. Mr. Azad was in Mumbai three day back to address a rally, but was kept detained for two days by police. He was denied permission to hold a rally, and barred from visiting Chaityabhoomi in Dadar. “We all know what happened there after the rally. In addition, the police force is busy on bandobast for December 31. Why do you want to organise the rally on the same day? You can hold it at a later date,” said Mr Kesarkar. Meanwhile, the state government has made heavy bandobast for visitors to the memorial on Tuesday. “A total of 5,000 constables, 12 State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) platoons, 1,200 homeguards will be deployed. Inspector General of Police, Superintendent of Police and eight additional SPs along with other officers will be on the field. Additional 2,000 volunteers too have been posted,” said Mr. Kesarkar. Parking arrangement for 7,500 cars has been made, plus 200 special buses will be used to carry people to the victory memorial.|0|
J&K Governor Malik promises probe|Jammu|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Jammu and Kashmir Governor Satya Pal Malik on Monday promised a high-level probe into the alleged torture of some family members of a militant in the Valley as strict orders have been given to the forces not to harass families of terrorists. The Governor made the remark a day after former Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti met a suspected militant’s sister, who was allegedly beaten up by police, and warned of “dangerous consequences” if harassment of militants’ families is not stopped. “We have no fight with the families of the terrorists and had already passed strict orders to the forces not to indulge in excesses against them. If something like that happened as she (Mehbooba) is claiming, I will certainly order a high-level probe into it, the Governor told reporters on the sidelines of a function here.  Ex-CM’s tweet Ms Mufti, after meeting the family in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district on Sunday, tweeted, “Visited Patipora Pulwama where Rubina (whose brother happens to be a militant) was, along with her husband & brother, beaten mercilessly in police custody. The severe nature of her injuries has left her bedridden.” “I want to ask the Governor if you have a fight with a militant, why are his relatives, especially his sister, beaten? We will not allow this. I want to tell the Governor and warn the police as well that if there is another such incident, then there will be dangerous consequences,” she had said. Responding to a question about the issue raised by the former Chief Minister, the Governor said, “She will address me because I am the Governor of the State. I am not taking her words in a bad taste because she is the daughter of my friend (Mufti Mohammad Sayeed).”|0|

We do not pay attention to Shiv Sena’s criticism of PM: Fadnavis|Mumbai|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Monday said his party does not pay attention to Shiv Sena’s criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “We do not pay attention to criticism from the Sena. People of this country know about their Prime Minister. He is the kind of leader who spends every minute of his life for this country and people. He has been serving the nation selflessly,” said Mr. Fadnavis said at a press conference here. He was replying to a question about Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray reiterating Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s allegation of‘chowkidar hi chor hai’(watchman is a thief). Asked whether the Bharatiya Janata Party wants to take the Sena along in the 2019 elections, Mr. Fadnavis said his party will be contesting against Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and would want Sena to be with them. “I will reply at right time and right place to such comments,” he said. Mr. Fadnavis’ reply comes on a day when Sena mouthpieceSaamnain its editorial slammed the BJP yet again, for joining hands with the NCP in Ahmednagar Municipal Corporation. The editorial said, “It was the same NCP which had given unconditional support to BJP in 2014 to form the government. It means both these parties indulged in adultery but deny it in public. Now they both stand naked and entire Maharashtra is laughing at them.” The editorial even taunted NCP president Sharad Pawar who on Sunday had said that he will be taking action against all party corporators who sided with the BJP. “This is all cover-up. It is now said that Sharad Pawar and other state leaders of the NCP had no clue about the affair between NCP and BJP. Only he knows the truth of it, but this democracy can soon turn in to anarchy,” the editorial said. Replying to Sena’s criticism, Mr. Fadnavis said he had instructed his party leaders to tie-up with Shiv Sena if the party came forward with such a proposal or request. “We waited till the last minute but Sena did not make any request to us. And we did not ask for NCP’s support, they gave it on their own. Therefore questions should be asked to NCP and not us,” he said.|0|

P. Sharma said on Monday. Mr. Sharma said the overall Left Wing Extremism situation remained under control even as there was need to flush out Maoists from parts of Malkangiri, Koraput, Kalahandi, Rayagada, Kandhamal and Nuapada districts. LWE-hit districts He said the number of LWE-affected districts has come down to 15 from 19 this year.

Farmer falls at M.P. official’s feet for power connection|Shivpuri (M.P.)|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|A farmer in Madhya Pradesh’s Shivpuri fell to the feet of District Collector for a power connection in his field, a video of which went viral on social media. The incident happened on Friday when Ajeet Jatav, a resident of Rannod village, approached District Collector Anugraha P. as she stepped out of her office for lunch and threw himself at her feet. The farmer was reportedly waiting there since morning. The video shows the Collector listening to Mr. Jatav’s problem briefly and assuring him to look into it. According to Mr. Jatav, he had paid for a transformer near his field and an electricity connection on August 14. Later talking to reporters, he said that he went to the Collector as he didn’t get the connection despite several requests. As the video went viral, the district administration moved swiftly and installed the transformer near his field Sunday. However, Madhya Pradesh Power Company General Manager R.K. Agrawal said the complaint of the farmer was not valid. “As per rules, the farmer is not supposed to get the power connection directly from transformer,” he said. Mr. Agrawal said the matter got delayed because Mr. Jatav was insisting for installation of a transformer. Meanwhile, State Congress spokesman Pankaj Chaturvedi said Guna lawmaker Jyotiraditya Scindia called up the Collector and directed her not to behave with people “inhumanly”. “In future, no public servant should deal with people in such inhuman manner. Hearing public problems and finding a solution to them is your moral as well as administrative duty,” Mr. Chaturvedi quoted Mr. Scindia as saying. He said the Collector then directed officials concerned to install the transformer. Shivpuri falls in Mr. Scindia’s constituency.|0|

BJP ridicules Jharkhand Oppn. leaders|Ranchi|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The BJP on Monday ridiculed Jharkhand Opposition leaders for sitting in the lap of jailed RJD chief Lalu Prasad to get a road map for Mahagathbandhan despite the former Bihar Chief Minister being a convict and a known opponent of the creation of Jharkhand. Soren’s visit BJPs State unit spokesman Pratul Shahdeo’s sneer comment came in the background of JMM working president and former Chief Minister Hemant Soren visiting Lalu at the RIIMS recently among other leaders. After prolonged political process, Jhakhand was created in 2000 out of the Bihar. ‘Shameful and sad’ It is shameful and sad to see these Opposition leaders heading parties, beginning with the name of Jharkhand, sitting in the lap of a convict, Lalu Prasad, to get an outline of their Mahagathbandhan, Mr. Shahdeo said here. Mr. Shahdeo said despite knowing him as a strong opponent of Jharkhand Statehood during the Statehood struggle when Lalu was the Chief Minister, the opposition party leaders are sitting in the lap of him. It is an insult to the martyrs of Jharkhand, he said. Lalu, who is serving prison term following his conviction in fodder scam cases, is presently undergoing treatment at RIIMS. Former Union Minister Sharad Yadav, BJP leader Shatrughan Sinha, Congress leaders Subodh Kant Sahay and Shakeel Ahmed, Rashtriya Lok Samata Party head Upendra Kushwaha, besides Hemant Soren, Prasads sons Tejeswi and Tej Pratap, had met Lalu during the last fortnight in course of strengthening mahagathbandhan in Bihar and Jharkhand.|0|
‘Rahul, Sonia must explain role in chopper deal’|Mumbai|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Monday wondered why the Gandhi family’s name always surfaces in cases of wrongdoings in defence deals. Addressing a press conference here, he demanded that the Congress president Rahul Gandhi and former party president Sonia Gandhi explain their role in the Augusta-Westland VVIP chopper deal amid allegations of them having received kickbacks. Mr. Fadnavis also attacked Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, who in a statement on Sunday had supported the Gandhis and said power is being misused by the ruling party to target opposition. “Congress now has an advocate as big as Sharad Pawar. Even he has no option but to speak for the Congress,” he said. “The Italian court order regarding Augusta-Westland has named Sonia Gandhi four times. Christian Michel, the key accused, has named Ms. Gandhi and ‘her son who could become Prime Minister’. It is clear that commission worth Rs. 225 crore is being fixed in this case of which Rs. 125 crore has been delivered. We demand that the Gandhi family must come out in open and explain to the country about this,” he said. Meanwhile, Maharashtra unit Congress president Ashok Chavan slammed the CM and questioned his priorities. “Over 17,000 farmers have committed suicides in the State, explosives were found at the home of a right-wing activist of Sanatan Sanstha, loan waiver announced by the government is not yet over and CM never thought about addressing a press conference on these issues. He should decide whether he is the party leader or leading the state,” Mr. Chavan said. It was the UPA government, led by Congress, which initiated probe into the VVIP chopper case through CBI, he said.|0|
Election was free and fair: Hasina|Dhaka|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Defending Sunday’s parliamentary election, which the Opposition called “farcical”, Awami League chief and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Monday blamed the Opposition for its electoral debacle. She said her government’s pro-people policies helped the party sweep the poll — the Awami League won more than 96% of seats in the National Parliament. The election was “free and fair”, said Ms. Hasina. “They [Opposition] have put up four to five candidates per seat and there were genuinely winnable candidates among them,” said the Prime Minister. “There were winnable leaders, like Jiaur Rahman from Dhaka Dhamrai. But they were not made candidates. How can you get more seats if you do not have proper candidates?” she asked. “Actually, they were defeated due to their own fault. They are responsible for their defeat... only a few of their candidates were active and they refused to engage in propaganda [campaign] properly,” said Ms. Hasina. ‘Terrorist activities’ Among the other “problems” of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the Jamaat-e-Islami, there were routine terrorist activities, which pushed them away from the people, the Prime Minister said. “The BNP-Jamaat set fire on 3,900 vehicles in 2013-2015 and 500 people were killed. Vehicles and trains were torched. [These are] terrorist activities and people rejected such activities,” she said. Ms. Hasina also gave a detailed account of the good work done by her government and said itwill continue with the Awami League’s model of development. “Our poverty has been reduced from 40 to 21%, per capita income has gone up to $1,751 and growth is 7.86%. The fruits of this development has gone into the grassroots and people voted for us.” She repeatedly emphasised on the need to strengthen democracy. “Without a democratic system, we can’t make progress and I believe in that. Accountability too is important and we do need to approach people in every five years... and they do have the right to criticise us,” Ms. Hasina said. ‘Fabricated cases’ Answering a question on the fairness of the Election Commission, Ms. Hasina said that the Commission is “free to investigate” any kind of malpractices if complaints are lodged. Asked about reports that a ballot box was found outside a polling station in Chittagong, the Prime Minister said “such cases are fabricated”. Pointing to the cancellation of polling at 22 stations out of 40,000 centres, she said “such cases are less than 1%”. She added that “there won’t be any discrimination [even if one belongs to the Opposition] as far as her developmental projects are concerned... I will work for all.” However, Ms. Hasina did not make any firm commitment about reaching out to the Opposition. Giving the example of India, she said every political party needs a face. “In 2014, the Congress did not have one and they suffered in the elections, so did the Opposition [in Bangladesh]… they did not have a face.” Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee congratulated Ms. Hasina on her victory. “Spoke to Sheikh Hasina Ji and congratulated her on the resounding victory in the Bangladesh elections. Wished her the very best for the tenure ahead,” Mr. Modi tweeted.|0|
Trump softens stance on troop withdrawal from Syria|Washington|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|President Donald Trump appeared Monday to water down shock plans for an immediate pullout of U.S. troops from Syria, even as he claimed that his achievements in the conflict should make him a “national hero”. The tweeted comment came the day after Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said Mr. Trump had promised to stay in Syria to finish the job of destroying the Islamic State (IS) — days after he shocked allies, and his own military establishment, by saying troops were coming home. “If anybody but Donald Trump did what I did in Syria, which was an ISIS loaded mess when I became President, they would be a national hero,” Mr. Trump tweeted. “ISIS is mostly gone, we’re slowly sending our troops back home to be with their families, while at the same time fighting ISIS remnants,” he said. About 2,000 U.S. forces and other foreign troops are in Syria to assist local fighters battling IS. Mr. Trump announced his Syria pullout by saying “We’ve won against ISIS,” even though thousands of the group’s fighters are thought to remain in Syria after the collapse of their “caliphate”. Military and security experts said Mr. Trump was overstating the case, and warned against a hasty withdrawal. In Afghanistan, Mr. Trump wants to bring home about half of the 14,000 soldiers locked in a war against Taliban, but no formal announcement has been made on that move. On Sunday, Republican Senator Graham, who had expressed concern about Mr. Trump’s pullout, emerged from a two-hour lunch meeting with the President to say that Mr. Trump “understands the need to finish the job”. “I think the President is committed to making sure when we leave Syria that ISIS is completely defeated,” he said.|0|
CCTV footage shows people carrying ‘Khashoggi’s body parts’|Ankara|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|A Turkish television station has broadcast CCTV footage showing men carrying cases and bags which it says contained slain journalist Jamal Khashoggi’s body parts. The images shown on A-Haber television late on Sunday feature three men carrying five suitcases and two large black bags into the home of the Saudi Consul-General in Istanbul. Near Saudi consulate The residence lies a short distance from the Saudi consulate where Khashoggi was murdered in October in a killing that has tested Riyadh’s relations with the West. Citing unnamed Turkish sources, A-Haber said Khashoggi’s dismembered body was inside the cases and bags. Khashoggi was killed on October 2 shortly after entering the kingdom’s consulate in what Riyadh called a “rogue” operation. He was strangled before he was cut up into pieces by a team of 15 Saudis sent to Istanbul for the killing, according to Turkish officials, with media reports suggesting that the parts were dissolved in acid. The consulate and the residence were searched by the Turkish authorities in October along with several other locations but Khashoggi’s body has still not been found. There has been speculation that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman ordered the hit but Riyadh has absolved him of any blame. Saudi Arabia has also repeatedly rejected Turkish demands to extradite suspects connected to the murder of the journalist, a critic of the Crown Prince. A-Haber said the bags and suitcases were put into a minibus which travelled the short distance from the consulate to a garage at the residence. The men are then seen taking them inside.|0|

Mahinda Rajapaksa warns against separatist tendencies|Colombo|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) should not be allowed to achieve, through its support to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe’s government what the Tamils “could not accomplish” in the three-decade long civil war, ex-President Mahinda Rajapaksa said, warning that the country cannot be divided. Addressing a public gathering at Nochchiyagama in the North-Central Province on Sunday, Mr. Rajapaksa, now the main Opposition leader, said the TNA could make a political capital out of its support to the government. Support to Ranil “They should not be allowed to achieve through Constitution what they could not achieve through war,” he said. He was hinting at the TNA’s support to Mr. Wickremesinghe to end the recent constitutional and political crisis. Mr. Rajapaksa was also hinting that the TNA would make use of the support to win political autonomy through devious means when Mr. Wickremesinghe introduces a new Constitution. “This country cannot be separated or divided, all must work in unison,” Mr. Rajapaksa said.  The TNA had backed President Maithripala Sirisena’s victory in 2015 and anticipated action on introduction of a new Constitution that guarantees political freedom for the Tamils in the Northern and Eastern Provinces.  Devolution of powers The TNA demands devolution of powers in the new Constitution to resolve ethnic issues. Sri Lanka’s Tamil minority seeks a power devolution arrangement to give autonomy to the traditional Tamil regions in the north and east of the island. The Tamils had stayed away from both the previous Constitution-making processes in 1972 and 1978. They had demanded ‘self-determination’ in 1976, which was later converted into a bloody military campaign by the LTTE.|0|

Senator Elizabeth Warren hints at 2020 presidential bid|Washington|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a progressive Democrat, said on Monday that she has formed an exploratory committee to run for President in 2020. The Massachusetts Senator, known as a liberal firebrand in her party, released a video in which she outlines her vision of a path to opportunity for all Americans, not just the wealthy. “Every person in America should be able to work hard, play by the same set of rules, & take care of themselves & the people they love,” she said in a Twitter post. “That’s what I’m fighting for, & that’s why I’m launching an exploratory committee for President. I need you with me.” Ms. Warren said in September that she would take a “hard look” at running for the Democratic nomination to challenge President Donald Trump in 2020. Ms. Warren, an architect of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau set up after the 2008 financial crisis, has been a strong voice in the Senate on financial issues and a self-described defender of the ordinary American against powerful interests. Those themes were reflected Monday on her website, which portrays her as a product of the American dream that has slipped out of reach for too many Americans. “Elizabeth grew up on the ragged edge of the middle class in Oklahoma and became a teacher, a law professor, and a U.S. Senator because America invested in kids like her,” it says. Earlier this month, Julian Castro, 44, who served under President Barack Obama, said he was forming an exploratory committee and was and would announce his intentions on January 12.|0|

‘No scope for a fresh election’|Dhaka|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Responding to the Opposition’s call for a fresh election, Bangladesh’s Chief Election Commissioner K.M. Nurul Huda ruled out the demand. He said allegations of ballot-stuffing “completely untrue”. “We are not going to hold a new election. There is no scope to hold the national election again,” Mr. Huda said. He expressed complete satisfaction over the election and said the voter turnout was 80%. Awami League joint general secretary Abdur Rahman said foreign and domestic observers had declared that the election was held in a fair environment.|0|
A liberal move|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Among the first decisions taken by Ashok Gehlot’s government after assuming power in Rajasthan was to scrap minimum educational requirements for candidates contesting local body elections. This is a progressive move and will restore the right to contest, at least in theory, to a large section of the population in the State, where the literacy rate, according to the 2011 Census, was 52% for women and 79% for men. The previous government headed by Vasundhara Raje had stipulated, first through an ordinance in December 2014 and then through the Rajasthan Panchayati Raj (Amendment) Act passed in 2015, educational prerequisites to stand for local polls. It was made mandatory for candidates contesting for the post of sarpanch to have cleared Class 8, and for those in the fray in zila parishad and panchayat samiti elections to have passed Class 10. The move was ill-considered from the very beginning. At the time, the amendment was seen as a bid by the then BJP government to lower the average age of those in the fray based on the assumption that its voters tended to be younger. It was, however, an act of paternalism that militated against the basic assumptions of a liberal democracy. It penalised the people for failure to meet certain social indicators, when in fact it is the state’s responsibility to provide the infrastructure and incentives for school and adult education. And it defeated the very purpose of the panchayati raj institutions, to include citizens in multi-tier local governance from all sections of society. These requirements had the effect of excluding the marginalised. The Rajasthan government’s decision should also force a rethink in Haryana, where the newly sworn-in BJP government had, also in 2015, legislated a series of eligibility requirements for panchayat elections, including education levels and a functional toilet in the candidate’s home. The Haryana Panchayati Raj (Amendment) Act, 2015 was upheld that year by the Supreme Court inRajbala v. State of Haryana. And the temptation to expand educational eligibility requirements remains. Union Women and Child Development Minister Maneka Gandhi, for instance, has previously spoken of persuading other Chief Ministers to take the cue from Rajasthan and Haryana, as an incentive for women to study. The decision of the new Congress government in Rajasthan should force a recasting of the debate on finding ways and means by which elected bodies are made more representative. In a liberal democracy, governments must desist from putting bars on who may contest, except in exceptional circumstances, such as when a candidate is in breach of particular laws. To mandate paternalistically what makes a person a ‘good’ candidate goes against the spirit of the attempt to deepen democracy by taking self-government to the grassroots.|0|
Dead ends of specialisation|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Among scholars and knowledge makers in history, one can identify a large number of intellectuals whose interests lay in seemingly disparate spheres. A poet and philosopher could also be an astronomer, technical innovator and mathematician. A traveller and writer could be a linguist and painter. Consider for instance Al Khwārizmī, Ziryab, Leon Battista Alberti, or Leonardo da Vinci. Each person’s many spheres of knowledge created a syncretic world view that contributed to a broad perspective, an easy ability to see connectedness among multiple domains of knowledge of the natural world and human interaction. One might today refer to these as non-partisan points of view, neither left nor right, or generalised independent scholarship — indeed there seem to be few words to describe such people. While there still are some scholars interested in more than one domain, such as Noam Chomsky or Ramachandra Guha, polymaths are rare in the 21st century. With greater and deeper development of various fields of science, technology and even the social sciences, specialisation is inevitable and even necessary in the contemporary world. This has no doubt yielded many important, even life-saving results. But, the fetishising of “expertism” and its blinding righteousness contributes to a host of problems that are being called the Anthropocene. Distinct worlds While polymaths are not in high demand, I suspect that the increasing call for cross-disciplinary and interdisciplinary knowledge is a recognition of this shortcoming without quite being able to label it. The tragedy of specialisation is that it leads members of the knowledge industry to see little beyond their bulwarks. And indeed, the world views of highly specialised domains are often so distinct that they have created not only disparate paradigms but distinct worlds. It, therefore, becomes difficult or impossible for an economist to appreciate the importance and value of biodiversity or why its loss is a major casualty (unless he or she tries to monetise it), or for an engineer to understand why decentralised solar power that allows greater democratisation among local communities is an opportunity to be grabbed instead of installing large solar parks by mega-corporations. It also makes it near impossible for a molecular biologist to understand that more targeted and improved ways to cut and paste DNA is not the point being made by those concerned about genetically modified organisms. It is about ownership, biodiversity, science and soils — cross-cutting domains that super-specialists will not be able to see. Never mind that corporate interests, personal promotion, careerism and pandering to their own vested interests create elite networks of corruption in different academic spheres. And these may of course confound arguments regarding specialisation and intellectual generalists. In a recent article inThe New York TimesPankaj Mishra writes, “in their lust for power [Alfred Kazin] could see how intellectuals as accomplices of political elites were prone to confuse their private interest with public interest.” With increasing specialisation, what one gets are experts who do not understand the connections between knowledge systems and ways of knowing. Instead of treating an approach to knowledge or a paradigm as simply a heuristic or a framework, they begin to regard it as fixed, offering specific solutions that cannot be argued against and carrying all truth. The limits of each knowledge system are not part of the training and their own blinkers are not apparent to them. Instead, one’s own paradigm of analyses turns into the sole framework for study and its outputs the only possible truths. Current challenges The principal challenges of the Anthropocene are the breakdown of the planetary boundaries. In fact, when this system was represented and described by scientists as the planetary boundaries of the natural world, there was opposition from social scientists. Upon their insistence, social structures have also been incorporated now into the system. This obvious necessity only points to the fact that there is so much fragmentation that specialists have painted themselves into dead ends. So, while geoengineers say that we need to seed the upper atmosphere with exotic chemicals to cool the planet, there is rightly a hue and cry from many quarters; when renewable energy experts call for more biomass plantations, others worry about the displacement of farmers, the reduction of food production and the loss of biodiversity. Of course, still other specialists insist that they have the right technology to produce food for the entire world in factory farms. The academic system of rewarding greater specialisation has fed the knowledge industry and universities too prepare students in precisely this manner. Policy makers are listening to the experts seeking their guidance, thus coming full circle and promoting further fragmentation. The assault on nature from the ramparts of specialisation creates narrow reductionist viewpoints that are fiercely defended by specialists who seem to have a lot at stake in terms of careers and reputations. Those at the short end are (ironically) the most vulnerable creatures and humans on earth making up the vast connected webs of life. As Max Weber wrote inThe Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism: “specialists without spirit, sensualists without heart; this nullity imagines that it has attained a level of civilisation never before achieved.” Sujatha Byravan is a scientist who studies science, technology and policy|0|
‘Taliban officials visited Iran’|Tehran|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Iran said on Monday that the Afghan Taliban has visited Tehran for a second round of peace talks. “Yesterday (Sunday), a delegation of Taliban [was] in Tehran and lengthy negotiations were held with Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister... (Abbas) Araghchi,” said spokesman Bahram Ghasemi. This came just days after Ali Shamkhani, secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, visited Kabul and told reporters that talks had been held. Mr. Ghasemi said Iran’s priority was “to help facilitate negotiations between Afghan groups and the country’s government”.|0|
Agenda for the fourth term|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The people, as they say, have spoken in Bangladesh. Sheikh Hasina’s party, which leads the Grand Alliance, has romped back to power for an unprecedented fourth term in office. The general election has given the Grand Alliance, or, more specifically, the Awami League, a huge majority in the Jatiyo Sangshad, the country’s Parliament, to a point where no effective Opposition is in sight. While Awami League supporters are in a celebratory mood, the Jatiya Oikya Front has rejected the results and demanded fresh polls under a neutral government. Jatiya Oikya Front convener Kamal Hossain, around whose personality the Opposition came together to challenge what it called the authoritarianism of the government led by Ms. Hasina, has called Sunday’s vote “farcical”. The significance of this election The political reality for Bangladesh at this juncture revolves around a couple of factors. First, for the first time in a decade, all the political parties took part in the election (the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, or the BNP, boycotted the 2014 election). In other words, this time voting was based on an inclusive election. Second, this was the first time a general election was held under a political government since the fall of the Hussain Muhammad Ershad military regime in 1990. The earlier stipulation of elections being supervised by a caretaker administration, introduced in the final stages of General Ershad’s regime and carried on till the period of the Fakhruddin Ahmed-led military-backed caretaker government (between January 2007 and early 2009), was scrapped in 2011 through a constitutional amendment by the Awami League government which assumed office in January 2009. Despite protests from the Opposition against the move, the Hasina government remained unmoved. It stuck to the justified position that a government elected for five years cannot morally and logically hand over power to an unelected administration for three months before a new elected government comes into office. This election has drawn the usual criticism from the Opposition, which has alleged that candidates did not have a level playing field in the course of the campaign. Moreover, on election day, at a large number of polling centres across the country, polling agents of the Opposition were either not allowed to enter the polling stations or driven out of them by ruling party activists. Mr. Hossain and the BNP have cited these as the reasons for voting having been unfair and not free. The government has rejected the allegations. It has instead pointed to what it describes as a massive degree of popular support for Ms. Hasina and her government’s development programmes. From trauma to victory For Ms. Hasina, politics has been a long journey from personal trauma following the assassination of nearly her entire family in a violent coup in August 1975 to her rise to political prominence in the years since she took charge of the Awami League. She has been chief of the Awami League since 1981, when she was persuaded to return home from exile in India by senior party leaders, including Mr. Hossain. Her return galvanised a faction-ridden party into coming together as a strong political force, a feat which resulted in her leading it to electoral victory for the first time in 21 years in June 1996. Ms. Hasina’s assumption of office as Prime Minister was certainly significant from the perspective of Bangladesh’s history. One of the earliest priorities for her government was a repeal of the infamous Indemnity Ordinance, promulgated in the post-coup circumstances and subsequently accorded legal sanction by a Parliament dominated by supporters of General Ziaur Rahman, Bangladesh’s first military ruler. The ordinance had blocked any questioning of the coup as well as a trial of the assassins of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family in any court of law. Five of the assassins were tried and executed in January 2010. That apart, the Hasina government took steps to bring some prominent Bengali collaborators of the occupation Pakistan army in 1971 to trial. These collaborators, belonging to the Jamaat-e-Islami and the Muslim League and rehabilitated by General Zia and given ministerial berths by Khaleda Zia, were tried by specially constituted war crimes tribunals and hanged. In effect, on Ms. Hasina’s watch, the impunity which the 1975 assassins and 1971 collaborators had enjoyed was brought to an end. Steering the economy To be sure, there have been questions regarding the government’s treatment of the Opposition in the run-up to the election — cases filed against Opposition leaders and activists, laws seen as an impediment to a free functioning of the media, etc. But it is the strength of its economic performance that the government has projected before the electorate, to a point where the international community, including the World Bank, has been appreciative of the strides made in the economy. Remittances from Bangladeshis working abroad have registered a significant rise, the ready-made garments industry has been performing well, growth has gone up, and massive infrastructure projects have been undertaken. In the field of foreign affairs, the government has based its approach to the outside world on pragmatism, thus successfully preserving a balance in Bangladesh’s relations with India, China and Russia. The government has also found appreciation from the international community in its treatment of the Rohingya refugees — nearly 1 million refugees have found shelter in Bangladesh following their expulsion from Myanmar. It has gone out of its way to ensure the safety of the refugees even as it tries, rather fitfully, to strike a deal with Myanmar on the return of the Rohingya. In a country where politics has often been vulnerable to extra-constitutional interference, as in the coups and counter-coups of the mid-1970s followed by the emergence of two military regimes in quick succession, and where national history has been massively distorted by those who exercised power between 1975 and 1996, Ms. Hasina has turned out to be the most powerful political leader in the country’s history, after her father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Her three terms in office, and now a promised fourth, make her the longest-serving head of government in Bangladesh. There has been no alternative to her. In the next five years, it will be the government’s responsibility to go beyond an emphasis on economic progress to ensure rule of law and democracy, in the form of a properly functional Parliament, a free judiciary, and an efficient executive. Now that the election is behind her, Ms. Hasina looks to preside over the centenary of the birth of the country’s founder in 2020 and the 50th anniversary celebrations of Bangladesh’s independence in 2021.

The man and his horrific crime|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|When I entered Sushil Kumar Sharma’s drawing room one cold winter afternoon in December, he was wearing a deep blue jacket and sitting cross-legged on a cot, talking on the phone. I waited nervously. Sharma is a former youth Congress leader and MLA, but he was no ordinary interviewee. He had been released from prison only a few days before our meeting, 23 years after he was arrested and then convicted for killing his partner Naina Sahni, also an aspiring politician. The crime shocked the nation, but the gruesome manner in which Sharma disposed of Sahni’s body was especially chilling. Sharma suspected that Sahni was having an affair. After a heated argument one night, he shot her dead. And then, to hide the crime, he chopped her body into pieces and burnt it in a tandoor (clay oven) in a restaurant. The case led to non-stop chatter in newsrooms given that it involved a politician, an alleged affair, and a gruesome killing. I have been a crime reporter for only over a year. Sharma’s release naturally piqued my curiosity. What kind of a person was he then and how had he changed? Was he scary, as we imagine killers to be? Did a person who had once been so unimaginably vile have normal human emotions? Did he remember that night vividly? I wanted to meet Sharma, much to my mother’s dismay. I spoke to the legal reporter who had covered his release. A few calls were made and I was on my way to Sharma’s house in Delhi’s Pitampura the next morning. I had previously reported of murder cases from a distance. Sharma was the first man I was going to meet who had been convicted of murder and released. The house was locked from the inside. The family didn’t want to entertain too many people. I peeped inside and saw Sharma’s 80-year-old mother’s smiling face. She looked at me and asked an attendant to unlock the door. Greetings were exchanged and she pointed to the room where he was sitting. My heart skipped a few beats. Sharma finished his call and greeted me with a handshake and a smile. “There are two types of criminals,” he began, his lawyer seated next to us. “Those who are naturally criminal-minded and those who do something in a rage.” Sharma said he was full of regret, especially for making his parents’ life “a living hell”. He said he had contemplated suicide. “But I slowly learnt that I was suffering as a consequence of my own actions and accepted that fact while in prison,” he said. After speaking to Sharma for an hour and a half, I stepped outside, my muscles relaxed. The first thing I did was to text my mother. “It’s done,” I said. “Nothing to worry. He is not scary.” The interview was not intimidating or nerve-wracking as I had thought it would be. Sharma’s crime was horrific, but to the extent that one can take appearance to be the reality, he seemed a changed man, keen to look ahead. As I drove back to work, I realised that it wasn’t the things he said that stuck in my mind; it was what his mother said. “Our life span has now increased by 10 years,” she said of herself and her husband. Sharma had committed the crime but they also suffered the consequences. My heart went out to them.|0|
General elections, biggest overhang for equities in 2019: report|MUMBAI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|For equity markets, the general elections will be the biggest overhang in 2019 though most market participants expect the year to be a lot better than the one just gone by that saw the benchmarks clock low single-digit gains with extreme volatility. In its India Outlook 2019 report released recently, Standard Chartered has stated that while it remained positive on Indian equity markets in 2019, it was more cautious compared with 2018. The foreign bank expects Indian equities to deliver positive returns in 2019 but with “significant volatility” as the risk premiums could rise further to factor in political uncertainty as the general elections near in mid-2019. It further states that while macro environment is still supportive for equities with robust high double-digit earnings growth expected, factors like rising margin pressures, stretched valuations relative to bonds, moderating flows and tighter liquidity are the potential risk factors. The year 2018 saw the benchmark Sensex gain about 5.91% or a little over 2,000 points. This was after it touched a new all-time high of 38,989.65 on August 29. Incidentally, the gains of 2018 are much lower than the nearly 28% gain or 7,430 points that the benchmark registered in 2017. Meanwhile, the broader Nifty was up a marginal 331.85 points or 3.15% in 2018. Coalition government According to ICICI Securities, one of the key risks for the market in 2019 would be the possibility of a weak and unstable coalition government, which could slow down economic growth though the brokerage believes that domestic macro stability will be a key catalyst for market performance in the year.  Global financial major Credit Suisse said the elections in April-May 2019 were likely to keep noise levels high even though in the last six occurrences, going back to 1996, these elections had no visible impact on market direction. A section of market participants, however, view the volatility on account of the political uncertainty as an opportunity for investors to put money in equities for long term gains. Vikas Jain, senior research analyst, Reliance Securities, believes that while the markets would be volatile in the first half of 2019 due to global slowdown and general elections , investors could use the volatility to build the portfolio over the next two quarters to generate higher double digit returns over the next few years. “Broader market could do well in the second half of CY19 on expectations of earnings pick-up among Indian corporates post fourth quarter of FY19 along with resumption of FII flows into India around and post general election time,” said Dhiraj Relli, MD & CEO, HDFC Securities, while adding that the Nifty has the potential to touch 12,400 during CY 2019.|0|
Diary of the year to come|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|As one year dips and another dawns, a calendar of anniversaries is un-scrolled. In India, this happens with the hectic intensity of a traffic jam. The year that begins today is the 150th anniversary of the birth of Mahatma Gandhi and the death of Mirza Ghalib. Hundred years ago What is it notably the 100th anniversary of? Curiously, not of historic persons as much as of three historic happenings. First, a much-hailed enactment, the Government of India Act of 1919, which increased the participation of Indians in the Government of India. Second, a much-hated law, Anarchical and Revolutionary Crimes Act of 1919, known notoriously as the Rowlatt Act or Black Act, which entrenched war-time restrictions on civil liberties — indefinite preventive detention or judicial review of those suspected of terrorism, trial without juries, jailings without trials. Third, a national trauma that arose from the vortex of protests against the Rowlatt Act — the massacre by army bullets of 379 according to the Raj, and some thousand men, women and children according to the Indian National Congress, at Jallianwala Bagh, Amritsar. Terrorism is wrong, Gandhi and other leaders said, violence evil. But are the civil liberties of a whole people to be frozen? Rabindranath Tagore returned his knighthood a hundred years ago, this year. But scores of other ‘Sirs’ and ‘Rai Bahadurs’ did not. So this is the centenary of something that brought enchained India some hope, as well as huge despair and, hauntingly, mass death. And it is also the centenary of heroic courage, of sacrifice. And 50th? This is the 50th anniversary of the Gujarat riots of September-October 1969, that involved massacre, arson and looting said to constitute “the most deadly Hindu-Muslim violence since the 1947 partition of India”. Out of the 512 deaths reported in police complaints, 430 were Muslims. Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, then nearly 80, visited India that year. A guest of the state and of the people of India, he fasted for three days for communal peace, went to Ahmedabad to see things for himself. In his acceptance speech while receiving the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding, he repeated to the audience what a Muslim girl in Ahmedabad had told him: “Muslims were being asked by Hindu communalists to leave the country or live like untouchables.” And in an address to a joint session of Parliament, he was brutal in his assessment: “You are forgetting Gandhi the way you forgot the Buddha.” This is the 50th anniversary of that chastisement. Two sides of 1984 Thirty-five is not a particularly memorable number but when an event is of some moment, its 35th anniversary carries something of that moment’s star-dust. This year marks the 35th anniversary of one such. The year was 1984, the month April. Squadron Leader Rakesh Sharma of the Indian Air Force was going round the earth aboard the Salyut 7 Orbital Station (picture). He was the first Indian to be in outer space. The ISRO-Intercosmos Indo-Soviet space programme had put six men into space, five from the U.S.S.R. and our own Rakesh, then all of 35 years old. Rakesh received a satellite call from India’s Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. She asked Rakesh, “Upar se apko Bharat kaisa dikhta hai? (How does India seem to you from up there?)” Footage shows the hero-in-motion slightly startled by the question but collecting himself in a moment to respond reflectively: “Sare jahan se achha(Better than all the world).” That immortal half-line from Allama Iqbal’s song reverberated through the air-waves into millions of homes watching the first-ever Indian orbiting the planet we live in. And as the nation heard and saw him, a sense of India’s greatness stirred within it. This year is the 35th anniversary of that dizzy moment. Not a star twinkles over India as an envious eclipse veils it. We celebrate India only to be checked by our misfortunes. Orbiting with stars Rakesh Sharma did not know that India had a date with another ‘star’ within two months that very year — Operation Blue Star, leading to Indira Gandhi’s assassination and the killing of anything between 8,000 and 17,000 Sikh Indians at the hands of fellow Indians. Large numbers of Indians reached out to the victims, taking them to hospitals, sheltering them. And, most important of all, documenting their trauma to fight for them another day. But much larger numbers did no such thing. They stayed put, watching with glazed eyes. This year is the 35th anniversary of that tragic sequence as well. And so, as we enter another new year, a question to pose to ourselves is: Will India in 2019 looksare jahan se achha? Or will it be a blend of pleasure and pain, glory and shame? No one can tell. But if one may have anniversary wishes, this citizen-nobody does. On this anniversary of hopes and of griefs, of courage and of cowering, we must look at the opportunities that knock at our country’s great and gaunt gate. We must make the national elections due in a few months a great example of democratic self-assertion, making the weak self-assert. In 2019 the people of India must vote, even more emphatically than ever before, without succumbing to manipulation and to fear. Seventy years ago this year, speaking in the Constituent Assembly, B.R. Ambedkar said: “…it is quite possible in a country like India – where democracy from its long disuse must be regarded as something quite new – there is danger of democracy giving place to dictatorship. It is quite possible for this new born democracy to retain its form but give place to dictatorship in fact. If there is a landslide, the danger of the second possibility becoming actuality is much greater.” Why should we be so alert to the danger that he pointed out? Not just because an opportunity has come for effecting a change of government but because far-reaching, liberating changes are needed in the country. Meaning of liberation What are these liberating changes? The first is the liberation of our public life from fear. Under Swaraj no less than under the Raj, fear can paralyse dissent, immobilise free speech, free association. It is not just an insecure state but insecure techno-commercial monopolies as well that are uncomfortable with freedom. Threats to Right to Information (RTI) activists and whistle-blowers and attacks on them, trolling of dissenters on social media and even murder, constitute democratic India’s single greatest failure, shame. In the eighth decade of its independence, India ought to be afraid of nothing, save its conscience. The second is the liberation of our politics from the stranglehold of money. Which, in effect, means saving our national resources from the darkness of deceit and exploitation. Money minted by illegal mining, unauthorised clandestine monopolies and brazen preferment has a vice-like grip over our polity, particularly over our electoral politics. Money frustrates democracy, negates it. Ruling parties everywhere say, “Our hands are clean!” The Opposition says, “Show us your pockets.” And when they change places, the charge changes direction. The third — and most difficult — is the liberation of ethics from the hegemony of lifeless conformism. For far too long, centuries in fact, have custom, and callousness overwhelmed conscience in India. Routine and rote rule over humane instincts, making women, tribals, the Scheduled Castes, children, prisoners, the mentally challenged and physically unable exposed to danger. The same dullened sensitivity has rendered our wetlands, rivers, coasts and commons vulnerable to misuse, misappropriation. Whoever be the Asoka or the anti-Asoka on Magadha’s throne, India’s Bodhi-tree needs an Enlightened One to sit by its root-bed and speak to it now, more than ever before, to be able to say to it to become not just ‘sare jahan se achha’, better than all the world, but ‘apne dil se sachcha’, to its own self, true.

Core sector growth slows to 16-month low in Nov.|NEW DELHI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Core sector growth slowed to 3.5% in November, the slowest in 16 months, from 4.8% in October, due in large part to a slowdown in the coal, cement and electricity sectors. Coal production increased by 3.7% in November 2018 over November 2017, dramatically slower than the 11.3% growth seen in October. The cement sector similarly saw growth in November slowing to 8.8% from 18.4% in October. Over the April-November period, the sector grew 14.2%. The electricity sector grew 5.4% in November compared with 10.9% in October. The only sector to significantly buck this trend was steel, which saw growth accelerating to 6% in November from 2.6% in October. Crude oil contracted 3.5% in November compared with a contraction of 5% in October. The natural gas sector, however, grew 0.5% up from a contraction of 0.9% over the same period. The refinery products sector grew 2.3% in November, up from 1.3% in the previous month. Fertilizer sector contracted for the second consecutive month in November by 8.1% compared with a contraction of 11.5% in October.|0|
Hasina’s triumph|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST| Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s party was always going to win Sunday’s parliamentary election. She remains immensely popular, her government sought a fresh mandate with a formidable record of economic growth and social progress and her party, the Awami League, set the agenda for the election and dominated the campaign. Still, the scale of the victory would have taken even her supporters by surprise. The party’s Grand Alliance won 288 of the 299 seats contested, more than the 234 seats it won in 2014 when the Bangladesh Nationalist Party boycotted the poll. This time, the Opposition coalition Jatiya Oikya Front, led by the BNP, secured only seven seats. But there are conflicting claims about the way the election was conducted. As soon as the results were known, Kamal Hossain, the leader of the Opposition coalition, called it a farcical election and demanded that the Election Commission call a fresh poll. More than 40 Opposition candidates pulled out of the race after voting began on Sunday, alleging rigging. However, the Election Monitoring Forum and the SAARC Human Rights Foundation, which includes both local and international observers, said in its preliminary evaluation that the election was “much freer and fairer” than previous ones. In the past, Bangladesh had seen governments declining to hold elections, one being cancelled and called again, and others being delayed amid violence. This time the election was called on time. Participation was higher, with the turnout at 66%, compared to 51% in 2014. The challenge before Ms. Hasina is daunting. To begin with, she has to heal a country rattled by political divisions and violence. The government and the Election Commission could have held the election without being open to charges that it was manipulated. There was a crackdown on the Opposition in the run-up to polling day. Pro-Opposition websites were taken down, thousands of activists were jailed, and political violence was unleashed to target BNP members. The situation was so grave that even one of the election commissioners said there was no level playing field. The Election Commission should conduct a fair investigation into allegations of rigging to restore faith in the poll process. Ms. Hasina should reach out to the Opposition. Her otherwise impressive record has been marred by her government’s authoritarian character. The victory is a chance for Ms. Hasina to mend her ways, to be more inclusive and run a government that respects the rule of law, the basic rights of citizens and institutional freedom.

‘RBI reserves ratio among the highest’|NEW DELHI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Analysis of the balance sheets of the central banks of 10 comparable economies shows that the RBI's reserves as a percentage of its balance sheet is among the highest, a report by consultancy firm Quantum Advisors found. However, the bulk of these reserves are notional and thus their value can only be unlocked when the underlying assets are sold, the report added. This makes transferring the excess reserves to the government all the more difficult. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Monday said that the government was not seeking the RBI’s surplus to meet its fiscal deficit needs. “This government has the best track record than any other previous government in managing the fiscal deficit,” Mr. Jaitley said in the Lok Sabha. “We do not need RBI reserves to manage the fiscal deficit.” BRICS countries The analysis, which looked at the central banks of the BRICS countries, Fragile Five nations and three developed economies, found that the RBI’s reserves — which a separate analysis shows was about Rs. 10.5 lakh crore — form 26.2% its balance sheet. Only two central banks — those of South Africa and Russia — have a reserve ratio higher than this. The other two BRICS nations, China and Brazil, have reserve ratios of 1.7% and 0.2%, respectively. “On comparing their balance sheets, you do notice that the RBI indeed has higher reserves,” the report said. Revaluation of assets “But… the bulk of those reserves are arising out of the revaluation of its assets, i.e over the years as the rupee depreciated against the U.S. dollar, Great Britain Pound, euro etc, gold and foreign assets held by the RBI when translated into the current rupee value, leads to an increase in its asset value.” “For example, 100 billion invested in 2010 at USD/INR of 45, valued today at USD/INR of 70, will show a valuation gain when reported in INR terms,” the report added. “All such gains are non-cash, notional and are shown as higher asset values and as revaluation reserves on the liabilities side,” the study said.|0|
Textiles, clothing eye revival in 2019|COIMBATORE|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The textile and clothing industry will end the year 2018 on a mixed note in both exports and the domestic markets, while expecting a revival in 2019. “The year 2018 has been better than 2017, but not so good,” said Sanjay K. Jain, chairman, Confederation of Indian Textile Industry. International demand was largely muted because of the threat of U.S.-China trade war and uncertainties. The domestic market did not pick up as expected. Stagnation in exports After almost four years of exports stagnating at about Rs. 37 billion, textile and clothing sector is looking forward to growth this financial year. Exports between April and November this fiscal grew 7% in rupee terms compared with the year-earlier period though the growth was almost nil in dollar terms. “This financial year, maybe, we will cross it marginally. But, we need a push,” he said. India’s share in the global textile and clothing trade remains at 4%-5 %. It is all a matter of competitiveness. India’s competitiveness should improve, he added. Apparel exports so far this financial year is down 12%. Annual apparel exports from India is nearly Rs. 17 billion, said A. Sakthivel, vice-chairman, Apparel Export Promotion Council. It is Rs. 34 billion from Bangladesh, Rs. 21 billion from Vietnam, and Rs. 11 billion from Cambodia. “These countries have duty-free access to many markets. “We (apparel) are not able to give competitive prices in the international market. We have a price disadvantage. We are yet to come out of the GST effect. The rupee value fluctuation is also high. The government should consider increasing the ROSL (Rebate of State Levies) rate,” he says. Rising imports What is a matter of concern is increasing imports. Import of yarn, fabric and made-ups rose 13% in April-November this year, compared with the same period last year, Mr. Jain added. With liquidity issues and stricter norms under Amended Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (ATUFS), investments have been slow. Margins are under stress and bank finance is difficult to come. The ATUFS norms should be relaxed and liquidity should improve for investments to revive in the sector, say industry sources.|0|
Mainstreaming victims of crimes|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|InMallikarjun Kodagil (Dead) v. State of Karnataka(2018), the Supreme Court stressed the need to have a victim impact statement “so that an appropriate punishment is awarded to the convict”. This throws up many issues that are of interest to the victims of crimes. The term victim came to be defined in criminal law only in 2009 in India. The victim of a crime is never heard as a victim during the trial of a case, but as a witness. As the victim is represented by a prosecutor, her concerns as well as the impact of her victimisation remain unexpressed. By and large, the police, prosecutors and courts do not have any substantive legal obligation towards crime victims. Indifference to crime victims remains deep-rooted in the accused-centric criminal justice system. ‘Secondary victimisation’ takes place when the agencies of the criminal justice system treat victims of crime unfavourably, or marginalise them during the trial. Marginalised during trial The trial process is organised in such a manner that the personal appearance of the victim at all the crucial stages is restricted. The victim is not present when charges are framed against the accused, when the accused is discharged, when bail is granted, when parole is considered, and when punishment or compensation is decided. On the other hand, the accused is always required to be present during all these stages. Crimes are registered in the form of sections of the Indian Penal Code (in numbers) which do not mean anything to the victims of crime in terms of their impact. Crimes do not impact all victims in the same manner. There is no way to assess the impact suffered by a victim. And whatever little is tried in this direction is always through a third party, such as a prosecutor or judge, who is invariably incapable of registering the aftermath of victimisation. The UN 1985 Declaration of Basis Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power effectuated a movement for victim empowerment. That led to significant reforms in the criminal process. It enabled victims to have rights and reasonable protections, and assistance and participation in the system. It also made a powerful plea to provide a voice to the victims of crime during the trial stage. A victim impact statement is an answer to most of these concerns. It has the potential to alter the course of things for victims of crime in India. Victim impact statements are written or oral statements by crime victims, about how the crime has impacted them. Often, the family members and friends of victims also make written and verbal statements. Victim impact statements could provide information about the damage caused to victims by the crime, which is information that would otherwise not be available to the courts. Details of the financial impact of the crime — lost wages, medical or counselling expenses, transportation costs and damage to property, including a request for compensation or restitution — can also be included. Generally a victim is assisted to submit a detailed form, which is standardised for this purpose, through a prosecutor. Deciding the quantum of sentence Hearing the victim in person or through a victim impact statement at the stage of sentencing could be crucial. After a criminal defendant is found guilty or pleads guilty and is convicted, a judge decides on the appropriate punishment. The decision about punishment is a complex one. The judge needs to consider the adequacy of the sentence as Indian laws do not follow a fixed punishment model. Instead, there is a scale of punishment and the court decides the quantam of punishment according to this scale. The Criminal Procedure Code, in Section 235(2), places a mandatory duty on the court to hear the accused on the question of sentence. The idea is to collect personal information and consider it while specifying the quantum of punishment. While this practice is laudable, it causes a huge disadvantage to the victim of the crime as the trial court is under no legal obligation to hear the victim. A victim impact statement will help the court take a balanced view at this stage. Hearing the victim during the sentencing will help the court decide the quantum of punishment as well as assess the amount of compensation to be ordered. The U.S., Canada, Australia, and many countries in Europe have made victim impact statements mandatory. It is time for India to do so too. The victim has a right to speak and the nation has a responsibility to listen. G.S.

Fourfold jump in bank frauds: RBI|MUMBAI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|There has been a fourfold increase in the quantum of money swindled by fraudsters from banks in the last four years, the Reserve Bank (RBI) said on Monday. Looking at the progress in the first half of the ongoing fiscal, the pace of frauds seems to be continuing on the upward trajectory, RBI data showed. In the financial stability report, the RBI said 5,917 frauds involving an amount of Rs. 41,167 crore were reported by the banks in fiscal year 2017-18, as against 4,306 frauds entailing an amount of Rs. 10,170 crore in FY14.|0|
Fund raising via NCD surges 3-fold to Rs 29,300-cr in 2018|New Delhi|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|  Indian companies raised over Rs. 29,300 crore by issuing non-convertible debentures (NCDs) to retail investors in 2018 to meet their business requirements, representing a threefold surge compared to the preceding year. NCDs are loan-linked bonds that cannot be converted into stocks and usually offer higher interest rates than convertible. According to SEBI data, companies mobilised Rs. 9,779 crore from this route last year.PTI|0|
Maharashtra woos textile investors|MUMBAI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Maharashtra has stepped up efforts to woo investment in the textiles sector from Tamil Nadu and Karnataka where integrated textile chains are grappling with several problems, including power shortage and niggles from the pollution control boards. Textiles Minister Subhash Deskmukh has urged investors to invest in Maharashtra, which is planning to make Solapur the uniform and textiles hub of India. To showcase the potential, the State government, along with Solapur Garment Manufacturing Association, is organising a three-day uniform, garment and fabric manufacturers’ fair in Bengaluru from January 8. In the last three years, since Solapur was projected as uniform and textiles hub, about 400 textiles units have been set up in Solapur and the State government plans to raise this number to 2,000 by 2022. “Our move is to give an equal opportunity to all stakeholders from the textiles industry to become a part of it,” Mr. Deshmukh said in a statement. Satish Pawar, director, Solapur garments manufacturers association, said the city was gaining significance for garments trade and the uniform & garment exhibition would help it further. The uniform manufacturing industry in India has an aggregate revenue of Rs. 18,000 crore, out of which Rs. 10,000 crore is generated from the manufacturing Industry. The rest Rs. 8,000 crore is through supplies to schools in the form of direct sales by local retailers. “Solapur is witnessing higher demand for school uniforms, kids garments, gents and ladies dresses because of easy availability of transportation, labour and raw materials,” Mr. Deshmukh noted. The government, in its new textiles policy in February last, announced a power tariff of Rs. 3 per unit for co-operative cotton mills and Rs. 2 per unit for power looms, cloth processing garment and hosiery units. The State had earmarked Rs. 150 crore for this purpose.|0|
New e-com norms spoil party for big players|Chennai|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|It was bold a step by the government and a huge blow for the big players in India’s e-commerce market. The new rules announced by the Centre last week have indeed spoilt the year-end party for the likes of Flipkart-Walmart and Amazon. These big players in the e-commerce space are now forced to go into an huddle, and devise a new way out to sustain their business aspirations in India. More than anybody else, these players will be hit hard as they run their enterprises in India on a marketplace model, which does allow them the luxury of having foreign direct investment (FDI). The tightening of the e-commerce rules must be seen in the context of alleged misuse of this marketplace model by many an e-commerce firm. These firms have been said to use a circuitous mechanism to get around the restrictions in a marketplace model. The back-door window is now effectively shut for them. Essentially, the new rules prohibit any equity relationship between marketplace e-commerce players or their associate firms with vendors. Should there be any such understanding between them, the vendors will then not be allowed to sell their products through the platform owned by the instant e-commerce company. Also, the new rules explicitly talk about an arm’s length relationship between them. Should a vendor source over 25% of their inventory from an e-commerce company or firms controlled by it, then it would be disallowed from selling its product on that e-commerce platform. The rules will have immediate cost implications for Walmart-Flipkart, Amazon and the like, who have built up huge inventory (using their group firms to stock up with vendors who sell on their platforms). How will they liquidate this in a short-time? This kind of a relationship with vendors is the primary reason for price unfairness in the e-commerce marketplace. It may seem beneficial for end customers. Yet, it has managed to destroy the competitive ecosystem, putting into peril the business ecology in the long-run. It goes beyond the comprehension of a lay person as to how the marketplace firms make money. Valuation issue One still is unable to fathom as to how these marketplace companies, who get only a commission for allowing vendors to use their platforms, could elicit such huge attraction from deep-pocketed investors who pump in significant sums of money into these ventures. The valuation game they play has ensured that these marketplace firms hit the headlines often. With the government stepping in to close the bypass routes, these companies will find the going tough. There is no denying that the play-field is not level at the moment. The new rules will usher in fairness in the game. What the marketplace model has done is to kill the spirit of enterprise in smaller people who run the traditional mom-and-pop shops. Also, they have unfairly dented the price models of many a manufacturing firm, especially in the consumer space, through deep discounts for purchases through their portal. This has already triggered uneasy tension with many consumer goods firms when it comes to servicing products purchased through online marketplaces. The new rules may be interpreted as negative for attracting FDI. Further, there could be considerable noise as to how these will hurt job creation in the country. Nevertheless, the fact that very many unreported job losses too have happened with the advent of these marketplace cannot also be wished away. 0To the extent that these rules are intended to set right a wrong, these are welcome.|0|
Eight new unicorns emerge in 2018|BENGALURU|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Private Equity (PE) investments in India rose to the highest-ever level of $33.1 billion in 2018, across 720 transactions, according to data from research firm Venture Intelligence. PE investments had already surpassed the previous high — $24.3 billion across 734 deals in 2017 — in the first nine months of 2018. The huge investments, including venture capital funding in consumer Internet and mobile start-ups such as Swiggy and Byju’s towards the year-end, boosted the total 2018 vault by 36% year-on-year. This data excludes the PE investments in real estate. “The mid-year Walmart-Flipkart deal clearly re-energised international investors’ appetite for mega bets in Indian Internet and mobile companies,” said Arun Natarajan, founder, Venture Intelligence. This has helped offset the slowdown in investments in sectors such as financial services, manufacturing and infrastructure towards the year-end triggered by “nervousness in the public markets and the IL&FS scare,” said Mr. Natarajan. The year saw the emergence of eight new ‘unicorns,’ or start-ups valued at more than $1 billion, according to Venture Intelligence. These include hotel chain OYO, online insurance start-up PolicyBazaar, food delivery start-up Swiggy, Paytm Mall and education tech firm Byju’s in the business-to-consumer segment. Udan, the fastest Apart from payments gateway BillDesk, the business-to-business entrants included software-as-a-service start-up Freshworks. Two-year-old business-to-business e-commerce platform Udaan became the fastest firm to reach the unicorn status. IT & ITeS companies accounted for 32% of the PE investment pie in 2018, attracting $10.6 billion across 383 deals. Swiggy raised $1 billion in a funding round led by South African conglomerate Naspers. Japan’s SoftBank led $1 billion fund infusion into OYO. Digital payments firm Paytm raised $445 million from SoftBank and China’s Alibaba for its e-commerce business, Paytm Mall. Its parent company One97 Communications Limited also raised $356 million from billionaire investor Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. The other large-ticket IT & ITeS investments this year included the $300 million attracted by BillDesk. PolicyBazaar raised $236 million in a funding round led by SoftBank and Swiggy’s rival Zomato raised $410 million across two rounds.|0|
SEBI rules for physical settlement of derivatives|MUMBAI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has directed exchanges to move stock derivatives in a phased manner to physical settlement mechanism based on their respective daily market capitalisation averaged for December 2018.

Vinay and Pankaj take the spotlight|Bengaluru|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|A defiant unbeaten 90 from Vinay Kumar put Karnataka in the driver’s seat on the second day of its Ranji Trophy match against Chhattisgarh at Alur grounds here on Monday. Vinay, who came in at seven-down, showed that he is more than capable with the bat, prolonging the Karnataka innings and Chhattisgarh’s misery. He was left short of his third First Class century when last man Ronit More was castled by an inswinger from Vishal Singh. A thoroughly disappointed Vinay threw his head back, but composed himself enough to pat More on the back as they returned to the pavilion. Chhattisgarh fast bowler Pankaj Rao was brilliant once again, adding three wickets to his overnight tally. Pankaj removed D. Nischal on the very first ball of the day, when he got an outswinger to defeat the edge and hit the stumps. The 29-year-old then accounted for all-rounders Shreyas Gopal (15) and K. Gowtham (15) to register figures of seven for 82 — his best in first-class cricket. Pankaj did exceptionally well to extract movement, both ways, from a good length. In reply, Chhattisgarh moved to 121 for three, 297 runs behind Karnataka’s total. Early strikes Earlier, the visitor started proceedings by picking up four wickets in the first nine overs of the day. Karnataka, in a spot of bother at 297 for eight, was rescued by Vinay. The final two wickets yielded a crucial 121 runs, with Vinay farming the strike in the company of A. Mithun (17) and More (10). Vinay, recently relieved of captaincy duties, used the crease to counter the bowlers. He walked down to the pacers to smother the swing, and made room to pick the gaps in the cover and long-off regions. The 34-year-old also ran well between the wickets, frustrating the opposition no end. The Chhattisgarh fielders were sloppy, missing a couple of run-out chances. “Our target, which we discussed before start of play, was to cross 400. We achieved that. They used a defensive field when I was on strike, so I had to take calculated risks to get the runs,” Vinay said, “I’m not worried about missing my hundred. More got out to a superb ball. It happens.” Mithun’s opening burst then reduced Chhattisgarh to 25 for three. A steady unbroken 96-run fourth-wicket stand between Amandeep Khare (43 batting, 80b, 5x4) and skipper Harpreet Singh (53 batting, 108b, 8x4) prevented any further damage. The scores: Karnataka —1st innings: Devdutt Padikkal c Harpreet b Pankaj 0, D. Nischal b Pankaj 107, Liyan Khan lbw b Pankaj 9, K.V.

NPA ratios improve, but are still high: Das|Mumbai|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The gross non-performing asset ratio (GNPA) of commercial banks improved to 10.8% in September from 11.5% in March and is set to improve further to 10.3%, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in its Financial Stability Report on Monday. This was the first half yearly decline in the ratio since September 2015. “After a prolonged period of stress, the banking sector appears to be on course to recovery as the load of impaired assets recedes; the first half-yearly decline in gross NPA ratio since September 2015 and improving provision coverage ratio, being positive signals,” RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das wrote in the foreword to the report. “Stress test results suggest further improvement in NPA ratio, though its current level remains still high for comfort,” Mr. Das said. The net NPA ratio also fell to 5.3% in September 2018 as against 6.2% in March 2018, RBI said in the report. GNPAs of state-run banks improved to 14.8% in September 2018 from 15.2% in March 2018, while private sector banks’ gross NPAs fell to 3.8% in September 2018 from 4% in March 2018. Under the baseline scenario, the GNPA ratio of all banks may come down to 10.3% by March 2019 from 10.8% in September 2018, the report said. The ratio of restructured standard advances steadily declined in September 2018 to 0.5% following the withdrawal of various restructuring schemes in February 2018. While asset quality improved, loan loss ratio of banks also increased to 51%. The capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of state-run banks however declined from 11.7% to 11.3%, the report said. PCA framework helps The restrictions imposed on 11 public sector banks under the prompt corrective action (PCA) framework has helped in reducing contagion losses on the banking system in case these lenders fail, the report said. While Mr. Das noted that the banking sector is on “course to recovery,” he added public sector banks need governance reforms. The Governor acknowledged that some of the cases referred for resolution under the bankruptcy framework have lagged time-lines, but added that the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) will strengthen credit discipline. “A time-bound resolution of impaired assets will go a long way in unclogging the credit pipeline thus improving the allocative efficiency in the economy,” he said. Mr. Das said the shift in credit intermediation from banks to non-banks has given the corporate sector a diverse choice of finance instruments but added non banking finance companies need to be more prudent on risk-taking. He also underlined the need to rebalance excessive credit growth, especially the one funded by short-term liabilities. The high credit growth is “not stability enhancing,” Mr. Das said. “The framework for oversight of financial conglomerates also requires closer attention.” On economic growth, Mr. Das said the slowdown in GDP growth to 7.1% is slower than expected, but pointed out to an uptick in gross fixed capital formation along with the dip in crude oil prices as a positive for sustained growth going forward. Globally, the threat of trade war, which would have weakened growth prospects, has softened, he said.|0|
Federer excited about playing against Serena|Perth|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Hopman Cup might have saved its best for last as excitement builds for the most anticipated tennis match involving a man and woman since the ‘Battle of the Sexes’ in the 1970s. Roger Federer and Serena Williams, two of the greatest players in history, will face off across the net for the first time on Tuesday when the United States goes up against defending champion Switzerland in the mixed doubles of the unique two-player, mixed teams event. Early sell-out Tuesday’s group tie is an early sell-out on the back of the prospect of seeing two of the all-time greats, with 43 Grand Slam singles titles between them, on the same court. “It is very exciting for both of us and I hope a lot of tennis fans tune in and watch it,” said Federer after opening his Hopman Cup campaign with an easy singles win on Sunday. “I admire everything she’s done on and off the court, we are both fierce competitors and we always want to win,” added the 20-time Grand Slam champion of the once-in-a-lifetime match. “It is going to be one time, probably never again. “She is one of the biggest champions in our sport ever, men and women combined, so it is great to be playing against her.” Past experiences Federer said he had plenty of experience playing against women, going back to his days as a teenage tour hopeful in Switzerland. Despite their long concurrent careers and having attended a few Wimbledon champion dinners together, Federer said the pair barely knew each other. “I don’t know her that well,” he said. “In the corridors and cafes, walking by each other, sometimes in the past she has asked me how are the kiddies and how is everyone doing, but if I said I know her it would be a bit of an exaggeration.” Williams has said in a television interview that she was looking forward to getting a picture with Federer for herInstagrampage. “It is the age of social media,” said Federer, with a grin.|0|
Bumrah — the evolution of a match-winner|Melbourne|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|In November last year, India coach Ravi Shastri and bowling coach Bharat Arun had an important decision to make. They were convinced the Jasprit Bumrah was ready for Test cricket but were waiting for the right occasion to blood him. Would Bumrah play in the three-Test home series against Sri Lanka that preceded the campaign in South Africa? Bumrah was held back. It was felt the pitches in South Africa, with juice in them for the pacemen, would enable Bumrah get off to a sound start in Tests. And instilling belief in the youngster was crucial. Both Shastri and Arun realised Bumrah’s uniqueness; batsmen were picking him late. He had to be preserved for bigger battles, wrapped in cotton wool. Well begun... And, when Bumrah was unleashed against South Africa early January, 2018, he made an immediate impact in Cape Town. His first scalp in Tests was a big one. A.B. de Villiers attempted to drive a full length ball that came in and played on. In the second innings, Bumrah dismissed Faf du Plessis with a vicious delivery that kicked off a length. And Quinton de Kock fell to a ball that climbed even as it nipped back sharply. Bumrah had arrived in Tests. And now, after his conquests in the Boxing Day Test at the MCG, Bumrah has a whopping 48 wickets in nine Tests [three each in South Africa, England and Australia] at 21.02 with a strike rate of 47.4 this year. Rare breed  No Indian bowler has taken more wickets in overseas Tests in a year. Bumrah has shaken up line-ups with his pace, bounce and variations. Down under, he has left the men facing him with physical and psychological scars, impressed the fans and captivated the Aussie media. Match-winners come rare. All of Bumrah’s three five-wicket innings hauls so far have fired India to Test victories. Former Australian batting great Michael Clarke tweeted, “In the next few months, Bumrah will be the No. 1 bowler in all three formats.” World’s leading batsman Virat Kohli conceded, “I don’t want to be facing Bumrah.” No Indian paceman in recent memory has made such an impact. Bumrah powers through to the crease from a rather innocuous run-up, unleashes thunderbolts. In Tests, he has more space and time to inflict damage with his whippy, quick-arm action. The ball taking off from back of a length often strikes the batsmen on the knuckles, shoulder, chest or helmet. And while the batsman is protecting his body, Bumrah can easily remove him with his subtlety. Velocity and craft is a dangerous combination. It’s never easy when Bumrah targets the batsmen with deliveries in the high 140s kmph. And he can also easily take the pace off the ball. Shastri, a shrewd judge of talent, knew Bumrah’s value from the manner he was hounding batsmen with his speed and variations in white ball cricket. And Arun’s association with Bumrah — he has overseen his development at every stage — is a heartwarming tale in itself. The technically-savvy Arun coached Bumrah in the under-19 camp at the NCA and was wise enough not to change his action, where, despite the load-up being so much far and away from the body, the arm was high and upright in release. Coaches’ contribution Bumrah, under Arun, gradually evolved. Work was done on his wrist position. And the coach tirelessly worked with Bumrah to find the ideal release point to send down the yorker. Now Bumrah bowls a potent yorker at will. Arun understood Bumrah’s body, knew he had to be stronger for the longer spells in Test cricket. Strength and conditioning coach Shankar Basu worked on Bumrah to enable him withstand Test-match loads. His rise in the longer format has been rapid. Now Bumrah and the Indian pace pack will be going for the kill at the SCG.|0|
Pogba continues to impress|Manchester|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Paul Pogba shone again for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s Manchester United by scoring twice in a 4-1 victory over Bournemouth on Sunday. Pogba had scored just one goal from open play in the Premier League this season under Jose Mourinho, but continues to flourish since the Portuguese’s departure with his second double in four days. The Frenchman’s opener on five minutes owed much to the brilliant skill of Marcus Rashford who dribbled beyond two Bournemouth defenders before crossing for Pogba to tap into an empty net. Pogba then powered home a header from Ander Herrera’s inviting cross before Rashford’s outside of the boot finish put United 3-0 up. Nathan Ake reduced Bournemouth’s deficit before half-time, but Pogba turned provider for substitute Romelu Lukaku to make it 4-1 and only the post denied Pogba a first ever hat-trick. Despite Solskjaer’s 100 % record, United remains eight points off the top four. Juventus sets record Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice as voracious Italian champion Juventus finished 2018 on a high with a 2-1 win over Sampdoria in Serie A to set a new record of 53 points before the winter break. Ronaldo curled in the opener after just two minutes in Turin adding a second from the penalty spot after 66 minutes, putting the Portuguese top of scoring charts on 14 goals. Fabio Quagliarella pulled the Genoa outfit level with a penalty after 33 minutes, with the visitor having a late Riccardo Saponara goal ruled offside after consultation with the video assistant referee. The results: Premier League: Manchester United 4 (Pogba 5, 33, Rashford 45, Lukaku 72) bt Bournemouth 1 (Ake 45+2). Serie A: On Saturday: Juventus 2 (Ronaldo 2, 65-pen) bt Sampdoria 1 (Quagliarella 33-pen); Genoa 0 drew with Fiorentina 0; Chievo 1 (Giaccherini 76) bt Frosinone 0. Sassuolo 2 (Duncan 51, 57) lost to Atalanta 6 (Zapata 19, Gomez 42, Mancini 54, Ilicic 74, 86, 90+2); Udinese 2 (Pussetto 39, Behrami 57) bt Cagliari 0; Empoli 0 lost to Inter Milan 1 (Balde 72). Lazio 1 (Milinkovic-Savic 62) drew with Torino 1 (Belotti 45+3-pen); Parma 0 lost to AS Roma 2 (Cristante 58), Under 75).|0|
Kohli, Rabada maintain top spot|DUBAI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|India captain Virat Kohli and South Africa fast bowler Kagiso Rabada have maintained their top positions in the ICC Test Player rankings which was announced on Monday. Kohli, who dropped three points despite an 82 in the third Test in Melbourne, still enjoys a 34-point lead over Kane Williamson. Cheteshwar Pujara has maintained the fourth position after a first-innings century in Melbourne, while wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant has gained 10 slots to reach a career-best 38th position. Rabada, who split the top ranking with England’s seasoned fast bowler James Anderson during the year, is just six points ahead of his adversary.|0|
Prajnesh falls to training partner Mmoh|PUNE|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Prajnesh Gunneswaran endured a frustrating start to life as India’s top-ranked player on the ATP Tour, going down 7-5, 6-3 to American Michael Mmoh in the first round of the Tata Open Maharashtra at the Balewadi Stadium here on Monday. There wasn’t much to separate the two in terms of rankings: Prajnesh is 110 to Mmoh’s 103. The two are training partners at the Alexander Waske Tennis-University in Germany. The first set, as a result, was decided by fine margins. The Indian’s new-found confidence in taking control of the points, changing direction often and stepping more into the court was on display through the entirety of the set. It was just that Mmoh, with a flashier stroke, was equal to it. Audacious drops The 20-year-old American broke in the very first game, only to see Prajnesh level at 3-3 and confidently hold his next two service games. There was a fine pass to get to break point, that involved a full stretch to reach a near-perfect volley from Mmoh, and two audacious drops where the underspin was such that the ball died in an instant. However, at 5-5, 30-30, Prajnesh’s unforced error proved costly. A well-constructed point ended badly, as he sent an easy forehand wide, with both the opponent and the court at his mercy. Mmoh broke through and then held to love to take the set. On the day, the 20-year-old would win 87% of his first serve points. In the second set, Prajnesh wilted, as early as the third game when he found himself three break points down. The last of these was brought about by a moment of indecision when Prajnesh, with a chance to nail a forehand down the line, held back. Mmoh came up with an excellent cross-court pass and was rewarded when the Indian netted a backhand subsequently. Prajnesh had reached a point of no return. Stretched Later on Centre Court, Latvian Ernests Gulbis came through a tough three-setter 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 over Portugal’s Pedra Sousa. The former ATP top-10 player had to dig deep, with Sousa, who came into the tournament following Marin Cilic’s pull out, proving a worthy competitor. Seven deuce game It took a seven deuce game at 4-4 for Gulbis to nose ahead in the first set before fortunes were reversed at a similar point in the second. Gulbis, though, secured an early break in the third and maintained it till the end. The results (first round):  Singles: Michael Mmoh (USA) bt Prajnesh Gunneswaran 7-5, 6-3; Ernests Gulbis (Lat) bt Pedro Sousa (Por) 6-4, 4-6, 6-4.  Steve Darcis (Bel) bt Roberto Carballes Baena (Esp) 6-3, 6-4; Evgeny Donskoy (Rus) bt Pablo Andujar (Esp) 6-3, 5-7, 7-6(6). Jaume Munar (Esp) bt Radu Albot (Mda) 6-2, 7-6(4). Doubles: Gerard Granollers & Marcel Granollers (Esp) bt Nicholas Monroe (USA) & Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan 6-4, 6-4. Luke Bambridge & Jonny O'Mara (GBR) bt Purav Raja & Ramkumar Ramananthan 7-6(4), 6-3. Sriram Balaji & Arjun Kadhe bt Philipp Oswald (Aut) & Tim Puetz (Ger) 7-6(1), 4-6, [10-8].|0|
Gnaneshwar comes good again|VIZIANAGARAM|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Opener C.R. Gnaneshwar was a picture of confidence as he notched up his second half-century in his third game to help Andhra score a very healthy 207 for three in reply to Hyderabad’s 271 on the second day of their four-day Ranji Trophy Group-B match at the Dr. PVG Raju ACA Sports Complex here on Monday. It was an innings of maturity and wonderful stroke selection from the 21-year-old Gnaneshwar, who hit a century on debut against Himachal Pradesh this season. He looked good for a second one before he was surprised by one from Ajay Dev Goud that stopped a bit and had extra bounce and gave a simple catch to mid-on. Non-threatening Surprisingly, the Hyderabad pace attack of Chama Milind, Ravi Teja and debutant Goud never really threatened to take wickets in the morning session. Only after tea did both Ravi and Milind generate extra pace and movement to test the batsmen. Milind then unleashed quite a few bouncers, with one of them hitting Jyothsaikrishna nastily just above the left forearm, before having the batsman caught in a leg-side trap with another steepler. Otherwise there was nothing much to rave about Hyderabad’s bowling with even the spinners — left-armer Mehdi Hasan and offie Saaketh Sai Ram — not posing any serious challenge. Sasikanth’s haul Earlier, pacer K.V. Sasikanth completed a second consecutive five-wicket haul to ensure Hyderabad, resuming at 226 for seven, didn’t cross the 300-mark despite some lusty blows by Mehdi. The scores:  Hyderabad — 1st innings: Tanmay Agarwal b Prithvi Raj 44, Thakur Tilak Varma b Sasikanth 5, Akshath Reddy c Bharat b Sasikanth 57, B. Sandeep b Girinath Reddy 33, Himalay Agarwal c Aiyyappa b Sasikanth 59, T. Ravi Teja c Hebbar b Prithvi Raj 1, K.S.K. Chaitanya b Girinath Reddy 6, Saaketh Sai Ram c Jyothisaikrishna b Sasikanth 23, C.V. Milind b Sasikanth 6, Ajay Dev Goud (not out) 0, Mehdi Hasan c Girinath b Prithvi Raj 25; Extras (nb-5, w-3, b-4): 12; Total (in 90.3 overs): 271. Fall of wickets: 1-12, 2-73, 3-145, 4-145, 5-146, 6-182, 7-226, 8-240, 9-241.  Andhra bowling: Ayyappa 19-2-64-0, Sasikanth 24-6-64-5, Prithvi Raj Yarra 24.3-9-72-3, Girinath 6-2-7-2, Shoaib 16-1-52-0, Jyothisaikrishna 1-0-8-0.  Andhra — 1st innings: C.R.

Fewer doping violations in 2018|THIRUVANANTHAPURAM|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|This should be some good news for the whole of the Indian sport spectrum as the National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA) has reported that there have been fewer doping violations in 2018 compared to the preceding two years. A note circulated by NADA chief Navin Agarwal, highlighting the work conducted by the agency during the calender year, says more than 4,000 tests were carried out during the year as compared to 3,363 in 2016 and 3,594 in 2017. And, of these, the incidence of doping has reduced to 70 violations during 2018 as against 77 in 2016 and 73 in 2017. Innovative measures This reduction, the NADA claimed was on account of innovative measures like Athlete Biological Passport Programme, Independent Observer Programme, Speak Up Mechanism and the all-India toll free helpline which were introduced this year. Also, improvement in the quality of dope control by way of successful implementation of the 44 corrective measures suggested by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). Another important measure adopted by the agency this year was the higher number of anti-doping cum awareness programmes which were proactively conducted to include school and youth level athletes. NADA conducted 84 such programmes (52 in 2016 and 64 in 2018). NADA was involved through the year in dope control at all major events like the inaugural Khelo India Games, Commonwealth Games and the Asian Games. As many as 498 international-level Indians were tested by NADA prior to the Asian Games (including 54 tested abroad), marking the largest ever testing progamme carried out by the agency before any international event. Besides these, the agency was successful in adopting an Anti-Doping Charter for Athletes Rights, in the working out of a draft anti-doping bill and streamlining of the long neglected Therapeutic Use Exemption procedure, which came in handy for as many as 14 athletes through the year as compared to only two in 2017. While the reduction of doping violations has improved India’s position globally with regard to dope control, the year as it progressed did bring about the shocking revelation that international weightlifters Sanjita Chanu and Poonam Dalal and quartermiler Nirmala Sheoran had flunked tests conducted by WADA, which reiterates the fact that the country is yet to overcome the menace completely. As the world steps into a New Year, it will be only wise to be reminded that the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) has put India in the high-risk doping club and the country could feel the heat by way of stringent sanctions, including ban from international meets and the Olympic Games, depending upon results reported in 2019.|0|
ITF doing its own thing: Anderson|PUNE|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Ever since the ATP announced the World Team Cup, a competition to rival the ITF’s revamped Davis Cup from 2020, it has been apparent that the multitude of tennis governing bodies — the ITF, the ATP and the individual Slams — were pulling in different directions, quite to the detriment of the sport. World No. 6 Kevin Anderson, the ATP player council’s vice-president says it is down to the ITF’s lack of consultation. “They [ITF] have been sort of doing their own thing,” he said on the sidelines of the Tata Open Maharashtra here on Monday. “They haven't really collaborated with players as closely as we would have liked. It has been better in the last year or so, which is positive to see. But it is tough to comment on something which is out of the players’ hands.” Anderson, though, hasn’t played Davis Cup for South Africa since 2011 and recently participated in the Laver Cup, another team event in a crowded calendar. Tennis Australia, which has stakes in both the Laver Cup and the ATP’s flagship tournament, voted against the Davis Cup reforms in August. “From my side we have been very focused on the World Team Cup and making it as strong as possible,” said the 32-year-old. “It is great for the Tour to start off the year with this and it is going to further raise the popularity of tennis.” Understanding The ATP and ITF did, however, reach an understanding to restructure tennis at the lower levels which will see a drastic decrease in the number of professionally-ranked players. Anderson felt these changes were for the good. “For the game’s integrity and the ATP’s image it is much better to have a cut off for people who are ranked,” he opined. “It could have been even higher. Look at the PGA [in golf]. It is higher than 750. You have to work and earn your spot there. So if you have a tour card, you know how good the player is. So this is a very positive change.”|0|
Smriti wins two ICC awards|DUBAI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Smriti Mandhana was on Monday adjudged the Women’s Cricketer of the Year as well as the Women’s ODI Player of the Year by the ICC. Left-handed opener Smriti won the Rachael Heyhoe Flint Award for the Women’s Cricketer of the Year for scoring 669 runs in 12 ODIs, along with 622 runs in 25 T20Is in 2018. Her ODI runs came at 66.90 while her strike-rate for T20Is was 130.67. Smriti played a crucial role in India’s semifinal appearance at the Women’s World T20 in the West Indies, where she scored 178 runs in five matches at a strike-rate of 125.35. Smriti became only the second India woman player to win an ICC award after fast bowler Jhulan Goswami, who was named the ICC Player of the Year in 2007. Smriti said: “When you get acknowledged for your performances through these awards, it motivates you to work harder and do well for your team. The century I scored in South Africa (at Kimberley) was quite satisfying. A lot of people used to say I do not score that much in India, so I had a point to prove to myself,” she added. Australia’s Alyssa Healy, who came up with some superb performances and finished with 225 runs in six matches at the Women’s World T20, has been named the ICC Women’s T20I Player of the Year. England’s 19-year-old left-arm spinner Sophie Ecclestone has been voted the Emerging Player of the Year after grabbing 18 wickets in nine ODIs and 17 in 14 T20Is during the calendar year.|0|
Apurvi and Anjum likely to keep their spots in National squad|NEW DELHI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Olympic quota winners Apurvi Chandela and Anjum Moudgil are set to retain their place in the National squad in women’s air rifle for the World Cup to be staged at the Dr. Karni Singh Range, Tughlakabad, in February. While Apurvi has been consistent and topped the chart after the addition of merit points for her Olympic quota and the world rank, Anjum has managed a third spot behind Elavenil Valarivan who has been in brilliant form. The team for the World Cup is likely to be selected in the second week of January. Provisional rankings A group of quality shooters, including the Commonwealth Games silver medallist Mehuli Ghosh, Meghana Sajjanar, Shreya Agrawal, Shriyanka Sadangi, Aayushi Gupta, Olympian Ayonika Paul, World University champion Viita Bhardwaj, and former Asian champion Pooja Ghatkar follow the top three in the provisional rankings. Anjum, of course, tops her main event — 50-metre rifle 3-position — in which she holds a world record 1180 in qualification. Gaayathri Nithyanandam and former World Champion in prone, Tejaswini Sawant, follow Anjum in the list. The young Manu Bhaker, the Commonwealth Games and Youth Olympics gold medallist, is likely to retain her place in both the air pistol and sports pistol events, as the No. 1 and No. 2 respectively. Heena Sidhu climbed to the second spot after her world record score of 587 in air pistol in the recent trials. Anuradha of Navy looks set to pip established names like Shri Nivetha, Shweta Singh, Yashaswini Singh Deswal and Annu Raj Singh in the race for a berth. In sports pistol, Asian Games gold medallist Rahi Sarnobat tops the provisional list. Chinki Yadav is placed third behind Manu but ahead of Annu Raj Singh, Heena Sidhu, Shreya Gawande, and Pushpanjali Rana. Deepak, Ravi at the top In men’s air rifle, the established shooters — Deepak Kumar and Ravi Kumar — remain at the top, and are followed by Divyansh Singh Panwar who was in roaring form during the recent trials in the men’s, junior and youth events In the rifle 3-position event, Olympians Chain Singh and Sanjeev Rajput occupy the top, followed by Parul Kumar who looks set to overtake the World Cup gold medallist Akhil Sheoran, struggling with below-par qualification scores. In rapid fire pistol, Anish Bhanwala, Arpit Goel and Adarsh Singh occupy the top three positions, ahead of Olympian Gurpreet Singh, Bhavesh Shekhawat and Olympic silver medallist Vijay Kumar. The averages were still being worked out for men’s air pistol, in which Asian Games gold medallist, World Junior champion and Youth Olympics champion Saurabh Chaudhary is the overwhelming favourite to retain his top spot. It will be interesting to see who joins him in the squad.|0|
‘Atmosphere isn’t the best at the moment’|London|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Pakistan batting coach Grant Flower admits the atmosphere in the national team is “not the best at the moment”. The coach also pointed a finger at team selection saying that there are a few players who are not fit to be in the squad. The comment came in the backdrop of Pakistan’s humiliating six-wicket defeat at the hands of South Africa within three days of the opening Test of the ongoing three-match Test series. “The atmosphere isn’t the best at the moment. Not many losing teams’ atmosphere will be the best. No one likes to lose. You don’t want to become happy losers,”ESPNcricinfoquoted Flower, as saying. “I’m not involved in selection, but there are quite a few guys with their places under threat. “It’s not just one or two batsmen, you could point fingers at a few players,” he said. Controversy surrounded the Pakistan team after the first Test with a dressing room leak which reported that head coach Micky Arthur had lost his temper. While talking about the matter, Flower said it was something that should never have happened, adding that players need to “look at themselves in the mirror”.|0|

Harvinder calls for more seamer-friendly tracks|MOHALI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The IPL may have put India’s assembly line of quick bowlers in the limelight, but the 1990s had also produced several fine pacers. Harvinder Singh was one of them. He didn’t quite live up to the promise he had shown; he played only three Tests and 16 ODIs. But, you may still remember him for some fine spells he bowled at Toronto in 1997 in the ODI series against Pakistan, though fellow-seamer Debasis Mohanty’s exploits are recalled more often. Great start Making his debut, Harvinder had taken three for 44. His victims were Shahid Afridi, Salim Malik and Azhar Mahmood. No wonder, his eyes light up when he speaks about that game. “It was a surreal feeling just making the India team that included legends like Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid,” he toldThe Hinduhere on Monday. “Then to open the bowling in my first Test, at Chennai against Australia in 1998, with Javagal Srinath was an even prouder moment. He was my hero.” Harvinder, who is now the Punjab bowling coach, said he regretted that he could not play more for India. “If I had a bowling coach, like everyone has today, maybe I would have achieved a lot more,” he said. “These are great times to be a fast bowler in India.” Great platform He said the IPL was one of the reasons the country was producing more quicks than ever before. “It is a great platform,” he said. “And you also get to work with some of the world’s best players and coaches.” Harvinder, however, feels India needs to have more tracks that encourage seam bowling. “Even Mohali is not what it used to be; it has lost a lot of its pace, though it still is better than most grounds,” he said. “When I played against Kerala here in 1996-97, the wicket was much greener.” He had taken 11 for 107 to power Punjab to a seven-wicket victory in that match.|0|
Pawan powers Bulls|KOCHI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|For a few moments after the match, the Gujarat Fortunegiants stars were scratching their heads in disbelief and disappointment. This was a match they appeared to have safely in their grasp when they lead 26-20 with about eight minutes to go in Qualifier-1 of the ProKabaddi League on Monday. But Bengaluru Bulls bounced back strongly and shocked Gujarat, last season’s runner-up, 41-29 and entered the final which will be played in Mumbai later this week. Pawan Kumar was the big reason for Bengaluru’s stunning turnaround in a virtual semifinal. The star raider first grabbed three points to bring Bulls closer — 23-26 — and a few minutes later got Fortunegiants all out with a superb raid which brought the team five points and gave it a 29-26 lead. After conceding the lead, Gujarat, which had led for a major part, appeared to lose its confidence and was all out again soon. Pawan top-scored for Bengaluru with 13 points from 13 raids while Rohit brought in 11 and defender Mahender Singh contributed six tackle points. For Gujarat, Sachin Tanwar had 10 raid points.  The results:  Qualifier-1: Bulls bt Fortunegiants 41-29; Eliminator-3: UP Yoddha bt Dabang Delhi 45-33.|0|
2018 — a breakout year for Mukund|Chennai|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Sasi Kumar Mukund could not have asked for a better start to the new year after he was handed his maiden Davis Cup World Group qualification call-up on Monday as a reserve for the tie against Italy next month. Speaking toThe Hindu, Mukund said, “There were lots of ups and downs this year but I am humbled and it is a dream come true to be part of the Davis Cup.” The 21-year-old had one of his best years on the tour in 2018 moving from 426 to finish the year at 295 on the ATP rankings. Mukund, who featured regularly on the Futures tour, made a conscious decision to go a step higher and play the Challengers more regularly with a handful of quarterfinal appearances being the highlights. Confidence booster At the start of the year, the youngster from Chennai made the quarterfinals in two Challenger events that gave him the confidence to scale new heights. However, with the new rules kicking in, the field was getting stronger with more players fighting for crucial ATP points, which also meant some tough losses in qualifying rounds. At one point in the year, he lost in 12 out of 13 events in qualifying. “It was a tough period when you don’t qualify and I will be lying if I say I didn’t think of going down a step back to Futures. But thankfully, towards the end of the year, I got some good results.” Mukund trains in Vienna, Austria, with a small group of tennis players under coach Martin Spoettl, who also travelled with him for the most part of last year, which has helped a lot. “When you are between the age of 20-25, a coach is an important person to have around you. “It is not just when you are losing but even when you are winning and like now when you get called up for Davis Cup, a person who can help you keep the focus on the game is very important.” While he did not qualify for the Maharashtra Open, the lone ATP world tour event in the country, after losing in the qualifiers, Mukund will now play a Challenger in Vietnam before joining the team in Kolkata. The 21-year-old is hoping to make the most of the experience.|0|
Mumbai goes in to a tailspin|NAGPUR|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The Orange City may be experiencing its worst-ever winter, but Vidarbha continued to turn the heat on Mumbai for the second day in succession. Midway through their penultimate Ranji Trophy Elite Group A game, defending champion Vidarbha has a foot in the knockouts while Mumbai’s chances of making it to the quarterfinal have all but disappeared. Seasoned pro Ganesh Satish failed to convert his fifth half-century of the season into a hundred in the morning, but Mohit Kale’s maiden First Class fifty ensured Vidarbha piled up 511 on a VCA Stadium strip that has started to offer turn. Despite left-arm spinner Dhrumil Matkar picking up his first five-for, the hosts finished with a mammoth total. In reply, the Mumbai batsmen didn’t seem to have learnt from Wasim Jaffer’s big hundred on the opening day, a combination of rash shots and disciplined bowling from Vidarbha’s spin triumvirate leaving it at 169 for six at close. Gurbani’s focus With Vidarbha having fielded Rajneesh Gurbani as the only specialist pacer, left-arm spinner Aditya Sarvate shared the new ball after Vidarbha’s innings ended after a prolonged morning session that lasted three hours. More than taking wickets, Gurbani appeared to be focusing on widening the rough. After being officially reprimanded for running on to the danger area in his follow-up, he was replaced by offie Akshay Wakhare. The all-spin attack reaped rich dividends as Sarvate and Wakhare broke the back of the Mumbai line-up with three wickets in 15 balls. Left-handed opener Vikrant Auti played Wakhare across the line, missed the ball and was adjudged leg-before. Siddhesh Lad was also trapped in front in the next over bowled by Sarvate before Wakhare deceived Shreyas Iyer in flight. The recovery From 31 for three, Jay Bista and Shubham Ranjane began the rescue act, playing sensibly for the next couple of hours. The two, especially Ranjane, mixed caution with aggression, defending deliveries that were fuller and using their feet impressively against the spinners. All of Ranjane’s five hits were sweetly timed, the last one which brought his 50 sailing into the top tier of the grandstand. However, soon after crossing his half-century and a ball after Wakhare had failed to hold on to a difficult return catch, Bista’s reckless heave resulted in Apoorv Wankhade running backwards from mid-on to pouch the catch. In the off-spinner’s next over, ’keeper Akshay Wadkar dived to his right to grab an inside-edge that lobbed off Ranjane as Mumbai slid to 130 for five. Aditya Tare was adjudged leg-before just before stumps as the visitors finished at 169 for six. Everything depends on how Shivam Dube — he has already survived two chances — bats with the Mumbai tail.

Bengal is champion|BENGALURU:|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Bengal edged Andhra by 11 runs in the final to win the senior women’s One-Day League at the Just Cricket grounds here on Monday. Chasing 199 for victory, Andhra, riding on captain N. Anusha's half-century, appeared on course at 129 for two. But her run-out triggered a collapse, Andhra losing eight for 58 in 13 overs. All-rounder Deepti Sharma played a key role (34 and three for 33) for Bengal, as did medium-pacer Shubh Lakshmi. Veteran Jhulan Goswami, leading Bengal, was not among the wickets, but made a useful 21. The scores: Final: Bengal 198 for seven in 50 overs (Deepti Sharma 34, Paramita Roy 32, Prativa 26, Mandria Mahapatra 39 n.o., Jhansi Lakshmi three for 40) bt Andhra CA 187 in 49.1 overs (N.

Rockets fly high|PUNE|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Mumbai Rockets recovered from an early loss to power past Awadhe Warriors in the Premier Badminton League on Monday. Anders Antonsen and Sameer Verma notched up hard-earned victories for the winner. Awadhe fielded Shreyanshi Pardeshi in the opening women’s singles against Beiwen Zhang, and the match went according to script. The China-born, Singapore-groomed player, representing USA, swatted everything in her range to ease past her rival. Mumbai banked on the men’s doubles pair of Kim Gi Sung and Lee Yong Dae for Trump Match points and the lethal Koreans hammered the Taipei-India duo of Yang Lee and M.R. Arjun into submission. Antonsen, 21, lifted his game midway through the second game to beat Son Wan Ho in three. Lee Dong Keun is a tough opponent, even for a highly-ranked Sameer Verma. The smooth-moving Korean covered the court effortlessly and sent his Indian rival scrambling to the corners. Losing the first game did not hold the Awadhe player back from going all-out and drawing level. The two were at their sharpest in the third before Sameer won. The results: Mumbai Rockets bt Awadhe Warriors 5-2 (Shreyanshi Pardeshi lost to (T) Beiwen Zhang 10-15, 10-15; (T)-Kim Gi Jung & Lee Yong Dae bt Yang Lee & M R Arjun 15-7, 15-9; Anders Antonsen bt Son Wan Ho 6-15, 15-11, 15-14; Sameer Verma bt Lee Dong Keun 14-11, 8-15, 15-11; Kim Gi Jung & Pia Bernadeth bt Marcus Christiansen & Ashwini Ponnappa 15-10, 7-15, 15-13).|0|
Warrier’s five-for restricts Punjab|MOHALI|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|First, Sandeep Warrier swung the ball viciously to trigger a batting collapse. Then, Mohammed Azharuddeen swung his bat, without being reckless. Together, the two pulled Kerala right back into the Ranji Trophy Elite Group B match at the PCA Stadium on a chilly Monday. And that was no mean task, for Punjab had reached a commanding position on the opening day itself. The host still had its nose in front at stumps on day two, with Kerala on 127 for three in its second innings — a lead of 31. Earlier, Punjab resumed its first innings at a rather comfortable 135 for two. But, these days when Warrier has the ball in his hands, especially when conditions favour swing bowling, a wicket is not far away. Swinging the ball either way, even while keeping the line and length steady, he picked up his second five-wicket haul of the season. Incisive first burst His first spell — 9-3-14-3 — ended Punjab’s dream of an innings victory at least. He began by making overnight opener Jiwanjot Singh (69, 129b, 11x4) edge to wicket-keeper Azharuddeen in his second over. That brought an end to his 107-run second-wicket stand with skipper Mandeep Singh. Warrier then had the experienced Yuvraj Singh caught at first slip by Arun Karthik. Before long, the host had slid to 169 for seven, from 137 for two. The captain, who continued to bat calmly, was unfortunate to miss out on a hundred. He had made 89 (182b, 6x4, 1x6) when he gave the third catch of the innings to Azharuddeen, off Warrier, who finished with five for 83 from 27.2 overs. Azharuddeen, playing his first match of the season, would soon find out the day could get even better. He came to the wicket in the first over itself after Manpreet Gony had cleaned opener Karthik up. The other opener, P. Rahul, however, dropped his head and played confidently against a strong attack. Losing his head But on 28, after doing all the hard work, he lost his head: an attempt to hit leg-spinner Mayank Markande out of the ground ended up in the hands of Baltej Singh at deep mid-wicket. Azharuddeen (76 batting, 122b, 6x4, 2x6), however, calmed the nerves in Kerala’s dressing room. He played some delightful strokes, including a sweetly time straight drive off Baltej, and a couple of sixes off Markande. The scores:  Kerala — 1st innings: 121. Punjab — 1st innings: Jiwanjot Singh c Azharuddeen b Warrier 69, Shubman Gill b Thampi 24, Anmolpreet Singh b Thampi 0, Mandeep Singh c Azharuddeen b Warrier 89, Yuvraj Singh c Karthik b Warrier 8, Gurkeerat Mann c Azharuddeen b Warrier 0; Gitansh Khera b Nidheesh 2, Mayank Markande run out 1, Manpreet Gony run out 11, Siddharth Kaul b Warrier 6, Baltej Singh (not out) 0; Extras (lb-3, nb-4) 7; Total (in 75.2 overs): 217.

Orphaned by the Yemen war|Sana’a|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Buthaina Mansur al-Rimi’s life has changed drastically since last year — orphaned in Sana’a, the little girl controversially ended up in Saudi Arabia for medical care and has just returned to Yemen’s capital. Her entire immediate family was wiped out in an air strike by a Saudi-led coalition that backs Yemen’s government, using an explosive device Amnesty International said was made in the U.S. Images of Ms. Buthaina’s rescue and a picture of her swollen and bruised at a hospital trying to force open one of her eyes with her fingers were beamed worldwide. Recalling the air strike Ms. Buthaina and her uncle Ali — her legal guardian — recalled the strike that killed her parents, four sisters, only brother and another uncle. “I was in my mother’s room with my father, sisters, brother and uncle,” Ms. Buthaina told from rebel-held Sana’a, where she has returned from Saudi Arabia to live with Mr. Ali and her cousins. “The first missile hit, and my father went to get us sugar to get over the shock, but then the second missile hit, and then the third,” she said. “And then the house fell,” added the little girl, who said she is eight. It was the night of August 25, 2017. A few days later, the picture of Ms. Buthaina attempting to force open her right eye went viral. The Saudi-led alliance admitted responsibility for the air strike describing it as a “technical mistake”. But it drew strong international condemnation. A month after her close family was wiped out, pictures of Ms. Buthaina appeared in Saudi media showing her being treated in Riyadh. The circumstances surrounding her move from Sana’a to the Saudi capital remain unclear. The Houthi rebels say Ms. Buthaina, her uncle Ali and his family were “kidnapped” by the coalition and taken to government-held Aden, before travelling onwards to Riyadh. Saudi media said she was brought to the Saudi capital at the request of the internationally recognised Yemeni government. Although the Saudi government has never commented officially on Ms. Buthaina’s case, pictures of her apparently boarding a private jet from Riyadh to Sana’a were published by theAl Riyadhnewspaper on December 19. Now, looking healthy, she sat on the floor of her uncle’s home in Sana’a. She played alongside her cousins with a doll, braiding its hair. “I want to go to school and become a doctor,” she said, her own hair tied in a ponytail. “I want the war to stop and for us to live in peace... for the children of Yemen to live in peace,” she said. Her uncle, sitting behind her, just nodded.|0|

Khejroliya, Bhati keep Bengal in check|KOLKATA|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The cutting edge in the Delhi pace department, despite the absence of Navdeep Saini, came to the fore when the tourists restricted Bengal to 220 and secured a crucial first innings lead on the second day of the Ranji Trophy Group B match at the Eden Gardens on Monday. Kulwant Khejroliya and Subodh Bhati collected three wickets apiece as Bengal fell 20 runs short of Delhi’s total. Delhi, at 41 for two in its second essay, enjoyed a 61-run lead at stumps. Khejroliya showed his skill and guile to provide an early breakthrough. A beauty of a delivery, deviating and bouncing off the surface, took Abhishek Raman’s outside edge to wicketkeeper Anuj Rawat. Good stand Abhimanyu Easwaran (40 off 62, 5x4) and Sudip Chatterjee (56 off 102, 9x4) produced 63 runs for the second wicket to lay a solid platform. Abhimanyu played some well-timed boundaries, predominantly on the onside, before being caught behind off left-arm spinner Shivank Vashisth. Sudip batted with determination after a lucky escape on one. The on-field umpires referred the catch in the slips off Khejroliya to the third umpire, who hit the red button by mistake before rectifying it. Sudip played the ball late, getting majority of his fours behind the stumps and off his legs. He tried to form another partnership with Manoj Tiwary but the latter blundered in shouldering arms to an incoming delivery from southpaw Khejroliya, who used the angle well while bowling round the wicket. Bengal lost five wickets for 79 runs in the post-lunch session. Khejroliya dismissed Anustup Majumder cheaply and Bhati bowled a teasing line to make batsmen commit errors. The lanky bowler’s decisive spell fetched him three wickets for 11 runs off five overs. Sudip, dropped by Akash Sudan of his own bowling on 47, became Bhati’s first wicket shortly after scoring his first half-century of the season. The left-hander edged it to Rawat, who went on to complete six dismissals. Writtick Chatterjee and Aamir Gani also fell to Bhati as Delhi stopped Bengal despite Pradipta Pramanik’s quick-fire 37, containing two fours and as many sixes off Khejroliya. The scores: Delhi — 1st innings: 240. Bengal — 1st innings: Abhishek Raman c Rawat b Khejroliya 11, Abhimanyu Easwaran c Rawat b Vashisth 40, Sudip Chatterjee c Rawat b Bhati 56, Manoj Tiwary b Khejroliya 15, Anustup Majumder b Khejroliya 4, Writtick Chatterjee c Rawat b Bhati 17, Agniv Pan c Sidhu b Shivam 14, Aamir Gani c Rawat b Bhati 6, Pradipta Pramanik (not out) 37, Ashoke Dinda c Rawat b Vashisth 4, Mukesh Kumar run out 2; Extras (b-10, lb-4): 14; Total (in 58.4 overs): 220.

Spaceship zooms towards distant mysterious world|Tampa|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|A NASA spaceship is zooming toward the farthest, and quite possibly the oldest, cosmic body ever photographed by humankind, a tiny, distant world called Ultima Thule 6.4 billion kilometres away. The mysterious object is in a dark and frigid region of space known as the Kuiper Belt. Celebratory music A guitar anthem recorded by legendary Queen guitarist Brian May — who also holds an advanced degree in astrophysics — will accompany a video simulation of the flyby on the NASA website. Real-time video of the actual flyby is impossible, since it takes more six hours for a signal sent from Earth to reach the spaceship, named New Horizons, and another six hours for the response to arrive. But if all goes well, the first images should be in hand by the end of New Year’s Day. And judging by a tweet from Alan Stern, the lead scientist on the New Horizons mission, the excitement among team members is palpable. “IT’S HAPPENING!! Flyby is upon us! @NewHorizons2015 is healthy and on course! The farthest exploration of worlds in history!” he wrote on Saturday. Scientists are not sure what Ultima Thule (pronounced TOO-lee) looks like — whether it is round or oblong or even if it is a single object or a cluster. It was discovered in 2014 with the help of the Hubble Space Telescope, and is believed to be 20-30 km in size. Detailed images Scientists decided to study it with New Horizons after the spaceship, which launched in 2006, completed its main mission of flying by Pluto in 2015, returning the most detailed images ever taken of the dwarf planet. “At closest approach we are going to try to image Ultima at three times the resolution we had for Pluto,” said Mr. Stern. “If we can accomplish that it will be spectacular.” Hurtling through space at a speed of 51,500 km per hour, the spacecraft aims to make its closest approach within 3,500 km of the surface of Ultima Thule. The flyby will be fast, at a speed of 14 km per second. Seven instruments on board will record high-resolution images and gather data about its size and composition. Ultima Thule is named for a mythical, far-northern island in medieval literature and cartography, according to NASA. “Ultima Thule means ‘beyond Thule’ — beyond the borders of the known world — symbolising the exploration of the distant Kuiper Belt and Kuiper Belt objects that New Horizons is performing, something never before done,” the U.S. space agency said in a statement. A vast ring According to project scientist Hal Weaver of the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, mankind didn’t even know the Kuiper Belt — a vast ring of relics from the formation days of the solar system — existed until the 1990s. “This is the frontier of planetary science,” said Mr. Weaver. “We finally have reached the outskirts of the solar system, these things that have been there since the beginning and have hardly changed — we think. We will find out.” Despite the partial U.S. government shutdown, sparked by a feud over funding for a border wall with Mexico between President Donald Trump and opposition Democrats, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine vowed that the U.S. space agency would broadcast the flyby. Normally, NASA TV and NASA’s website would go dark during a government shutdown. NASA will also provide updates about another spacecraft, called OSIRIS-REx, that will enter orbit around the asteroid Bennu on New Year’s Eve, Mr. Bridenstine told reporters.|0|

Young Spanish designers reclaiming black|Madrid|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Young Spanish designers are reclaiming their “Spanishness”: age-old traditions, religious imagery and even the colour black, which centuries ago was a signature of the country’s all-powerful monarchy. That is one of the messages at the “Modus” exhibition currently running in Madrid, which explores the influence of Spanish history and tradition on global fashion, including up-and-coming designers. “It’s a very important moment (for Spain) with designers like Palomo Spain, Leandro Cano, ManeMane, who are reclaiming Spain’s position in fashion,” says exhibition curator Raul Marina. “Young designers are making noise again, and they’re doing so via inspiration that is totally Spanish.” Take black, a colour that has come to symbolise French chic as epitomised by Coco Chanel’s 1920s little black dress. Its use in fashion actually originated in 16th century Spain. Before that, it had been a difficult colour to wear. After multiple washes or through constant use, the dye would just subside and turn into a greyish, brownish mush. But then Spain conquered the Americas, and more specifically Mexico in the 16th century. There Spaniards discovered a tree called logwood. It held a secret: from its wood could be made an intense and lasting black dye. At the time, Spain was a major economic and political power. King Felipe II adopted that intense black as his own and the fashion statement soon spread. The monarchy was “a reference for all its European counterparts, as was its austere black gown which would become the expression of maximum elegance,” Amalia Descalzo, an expert in clothing history at Spain’s ISEM Fashion Business School, writes in the exhibition booklet. And so it has continued. Foreign and Spanish designers like Cristobal Balenciaga embraced black in their creations and the younger guard are doing so too.|0|

Traits of mahapurushas|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|In his Subhasita Nivi, Vedanta Desika says that among virtuous men the jnani is the best. Such a jnani is a mahapurusha — the greatest among the great. A mahapurusha overshadows the rest. It is almost as if their existence is as unreal as the existence of lotuses in the sky. In other words, even the presence of the others will not be noticed when a mahapurusha is present. This idea of the best in each segment is seen in the Bhagavad Gita, where Lord Krishna says He is the best in every category, elaborated M.K. Srinivasan in a discourse. Lord Krishna says that among the Vedas, He is Sama Veda; among yakshas He is Kubera; among mountains He is Meru; among Maharishis He is Brighu; among Devarishis He is Narada; among trees He is the peepul tree; among elephants He is Gajendra; among serpents He is Adisesha; among animals He is the lion and among birds He is Vainatheya (Garuda) ; among rivers He is Jahnavi (Ganges) and so on. Mahapurushas perform all their duties, with a view to pleasing God. They are detached and reach God through bhakti or prapatti. They recite the Pranava mantra. Mahapurushas are not only knowledgeable about the dharma sastras, but also act according to them. They are also humble. Knowledge of Sastraic texts and adherence to them can lead to conceit in a person. But mahapurushas are never arrogant. Knowledge can be acquired through diligent study and adherence comes through tradition, but being humble is not easy. That is why mahapurushas are respected — because of their humility. They think clearly and are never in a confused state of mind. Their lifestyle is simple. Their merciful glances can destroy our sins. .|0|

Climate change takes toll on oysters|Cancale|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Gulping down oysters has long been a favourite New Year’s Eve ritual for the French, but as winters get warmer and summers drier many growers worry there will soon be fewer of the molluscs to go around. Oyster farmer Mathieu Le Moal and others along France’s Emerald Coast say the long drought in France took a heavy toll, leading to smaller harvests. Without summer rains that wash crucial minerals into the oyster beds, there’s no plankton that serve as food for the oysters. Too small  “In the end, we have oysters but not enough of the big ones,” said farmer Bertrand Racinne, who like most growers sells more than half his yearly production in December. Cold weather normally encourages a needed rest for oysters to mature, said Yoann Thomas of France’s IRD research institute. But this winter has so far been unusually warm and, paradoxically, too rainy. Waiting for rain Rains may bring minerals that favour plankton growth — but they also mean the molluscs spend too much energy eating.  “Ten grams fewer for each one, that makes a difference in sales,” said Philippe Le Gal, president of the CNC national shellfish producers’ association. In 2017, the roughly 4,500 oyster growers in France sold 1,00,000 tonnes. “Oyster farmers will see volumes down by 20 to 30 percent this year,” Mr. Le Gal said. “Climate warming is starting to have an impact.”   Oyster farmers will see volumes down by 20% to 30% this year Philippe Le Gal President of CNC national shellfish producer’s association|0|

Manu Nair, Corporate executive chef, Billionsmiles|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|A restaurant spends a lot of time every day in deciding kitchen assignments, drawing up duty charts, getting things in place to reduce wastage of resources and so on, I would want a tech tool that can do all these functions, compute the menu lists, assign people to different sections and take steps to ensure that food wastage does not occur, if specific numbers are keyed into the device. It will help the industry a lot. What’s out there? Platforms such as apicbase.com have food management solutions on the cloud that can offer many solutions to these issues. To reduce food wastage, applications like Winnow can help. This UK-based startup uses a touchscreen tablet to identify what the kitchen staff put in the bin. An electronic scale records the weight and sends a message to the user, giving the cost of the food they’ve put in the bin. The meter is connected to cloud software which records and analyses the day’s waste. This gives owners and managers the information necessary to drive improvements in their system.|0|
Visually challenged ex-boxer transforms a neighbourhood|Lisbon|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|In some ways, says Portuguese ex-boxer Jorge Pina, the loss of most of his sight was the making of him. “I didn’t lose my sight, I just see things differently,” he says. Forced to abandon his world title dreams, Mr. Pina devotes his time to helping troubled youth from rough neighbourhoods stay on the right path by channelling their energy into sport. “Before, I was a selfish and troubled person from a difficult neighbourhood,” he says. “But now I want to help young people, win the combat of life.” His sight problem developed in training in 2004 and eventually put an end to his boxing career. An operation two years later failed to fix his detached retina and he was left with only 10% vision. But even before he had fully recovered, Mr. Pina was asking his doctor whether he could run. “When I lost my sight I needed something positive, despite my limitations,” he said. “I chose what I was best at: running and sharing,” he said. The running has already taken him to three Paralympics and he is also aiming to be at Tokyo in 2020. The sharing saw him set up shop in Bensaude, one of Lisbon’s more deprived neighbourhoods, where he operates his own sport association for local children. Wherever he goes, the children attach themselves to him, whether they are taking his hand to guide him or just giving him a hug. “Jorge taught me discipline and how to channel my energy,” says one regular, 13-year-old Xavier Pereira.|0|

Talking tech and tracking this year|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|As parents, we do a thorough background check about our help, babysitter and even the schools in which we enrol the kids. But how well do we know about the technologies with which we surround ourselves? Your phone, your child’s tab that he/she uses to play games and your virtual Home Assistant? Lately, these dangers in the online space have transitioned into the real world, and as parents, we need to step in. After all, how would you or the child react to having a random stranger sitting at home all day with you? That’s just what we are doing today, in this gadget-crazy world. As a mom to a 5-year-old, I often ask myself how safe my child is in today’s cyber-world. More eyes than necessary Ever since Facebook rolled out their Messenger Kids, it has been getting a lot of flak from cyber pundits, just like the Snap Map feature that is freaking out parents about their kids’ safety. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a tough concept to explain to kids, about how every small physical device can connect to the internet and identify itself to similar devices. How do I do it? From Amazon’s Echo to Google Home, AI-enabled home assistants rule the roost today. Nikita Sharma, a stay-at-home mom of a 2-year-old, states how these devices excite the kids and counts for fun family time, playing games together or listening to popular nursery rhymes. “If it means less screen-time and interactive learning for my child, I am all for it!” On one side, you wish this is the assistant you need to make your lives simpler, but ever wondered what threats they pose to your children? Perhaps we should, like Mark Zuckerberg, start taping our laptop and tablet’s camera and microphone. An incident in Portland in the USA earlier this year described how Alexa recorded a private conversation of a couple and sent it to a contact in their list without their permission. They were understandably petrified and vowed never to plug in such devices in their home again. The makers are still clueless about how this happened. Easy answers, but the learning has been found wanting Rajee Deepak, a techie mom of two kids, aged 11 and 9, says she lets them use the smartphone and virtual assistant Bixby, but with restrictions. “I am okay with them using it for the weather forecast, score or to play songs”. But just like all millennial moms, Rajee is worried if this will make the next-gen kids over-dependent on gadgets and virtual assistants. Studies such as ‘Robovie, you’ll have to go into the closet now: Children’s social and moral relationships with a humanoid robot’ by Shen Solace et al, state how these virtual ‘friends’ substitute your child’s real friends and why that’s not good. For those unfamiliar, Robovie developed by Vstone, is an adorable robot which can double as your kid’s best friend; crying, laughing and walking, all included. The act of searching for answers and learning in the process is lost when all you have to say is ‘Okay Google, tell me the spelling of photosynthesis’. This begs the question of whether or not a child will actually learn something tangible without relying on technology. Don’t get fooled by those privacy settings or the voice-recognition software. In mid-December, Rocco, a talking parrot, ordered itself some delicious snacks for Christmas through Alexa in Oxfordshire, when his owner wasn’t around and the Internet is having a hearty laugh! But it’s technology that’s having the final laugh in this cyber dilemma. The Drop-In feature in Amazon Echo is eavesdropping in a tech-guise! Agreed, it does help a new parent or when you need to check on the elders in your family, but the privacy risks and the complicated security issues outweigh the benefits it offers, leaving the customer confused. There’s also news of how Alexa has overheard ‘Christmas shopping lists’ from everyday conversations and purchases are being made directly from the linked bank accounts — without one even actually placing the order. Isn’t that scary? Soon would a LEGO purchase worth Rs. 30,000 be delivered to my doorstep just because I had a conversation with my child about it? Steps worth taking Be it the smartphone, iPad or even the home assistants, take a minute (or maybe more) to go through the privacy settings and enable the parental controls and safe search options. Don’t ignore this step and click ‘I agree’ blindly. Act smart. Switch off the voice-purchasing option or at least set a PIN to make it secure. The safer route would be to disable microphones and video camera options in your child’s devices. If you buy any of these virtual home assistants, go through their manuals and read about them thoroughly. Find out what are the ‘wake words’ for each device and ensure your conversations don’t include a lot of them, that can activate the device! Opt in for a safe and recommended parental control app. There are many trusted names in the market, such as TeenSafe, Life360, Kaspersky Safe Kids, Qustodio, Net Nanny among others, that help in web content filtering, app blocking, time management and location tracking. Don’t feel guilty for using one — even celebrity chef Jamie Oliver uses it to keep an eye on his children.   The right discourse So now you have brought home an Amazon Echo or a Google Home. Don’t keep it away from your kids or forbid them from using. Instead have a frank and open conversation with the kids. Explain to them how we never disclose our personal details to a random stranger and those pop-ups in your phone or tab are just that. Lay firm rules on the time spent interacting with these devices, so they remain a source of entertainment and don’t turn into the entertainment option for kids. Ask them to steer clear from camera-apps and games that involve disclosing their location and identity. Sandhya Balaji, a mom-blogger, says she explains to her sons (9 and 6 years old) how social networking platforms work. She says, “Increased outdoor activities have helped reduce their dependency on mobiles. I give them a reality check on how these addictive games and apps like Facebook can open the doors for cyberbullying or predatory strangers”. Having a frank chat laden with facts helps kids understand better.    Autocorrect addiction  According to a 2017 report byIndian Journal of Psychological Medicine, there was a presence of addiction for 1.3% for Internet (2% males and 0.6% females) and mobile phone overuse (4.1%–2.5% males and 1.5% females) in a sample study of 2755 individuals.|0|
Foreigners can now fly directly to Andamans|New Delhi|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Foreign tourists can now directly fly to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands as the government has designated Port Blair airport as an authorised immigration check post for entry into and exit point from India. The decision to open up the Andaman and Nicobar Islands directly for foreign tourists came after it was found to be the most sought-after tourist destination in the country receiving an average four lakh tourists, including several thousand foreigners, annually. “....the Central government hereby designates Port Blair airport of Union territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands as an authorised immigration check post for entry into/exit from India with valid travel documents for all classes of passengers,” a Home Ministry notification said. The Superintendent of Police (CID) of the Island has been designated as the “civil authority” for the immigration check post at Port Blair airport with effect from Monday.

On the wrong sort of innovation|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The one thing that is common to all successful startups is that they identify a very real problem that enough consumers or businesses have, and then provide a solution that is significantly better than the current way the consumers or businesses are dealing with the problem. It does not matter whether you are a B2C startup or a B2B startup, this is the bare minimum that your startup should be doing if it has to have any chance of success. Of course, this is only a necessary and not a sufficient condition for success. There are far more startups that have identified a real problem and have come up with a solution that is better than any extant solution, than those that have been successful. Yes, there is always that ineffable thing called luck which is a factor. But keeping luck aside, there is another important factor that a lot of startups fail to take into account, and often end setting themselves up for failure. It is this near-obsessive need to be doing something that is radically different, a need to solve the entire problem from scratch and not build upon something that already exists. Elon Musk gets stuck in traffic? He decides to bore mega tunnels underneath cities to set up a new and hideously expensive variety of (not really mass) public transit. Sometimes, this obsession manifests itself slightly differently. Entrepreneurs get obsessed with whatever the ecosystem defines as hot when it comes to innovation. Last year, it was cryptocurrency. This year, it is things like Artificial Intelligence, data science and so on. So your startup may be using only a few Excel sheets, but you will claim it is AI, and soon enough start believing in that lie too. I can, unfortunately, see manifestations of this wrong kind of obsession in a lot of important real-world problems in India that more likely than not are going to be solved by successful startups. The most prominent among these problems is that of end-to-end commuting in urban cities. Taking a person from their home to their workplace, and then back home again. Or the adjacent problem of heavy traffic in such cities. That ideas like personal transporters, electric scooters and their variants, which may be faddish in pockets of the developed world right now, and in the case of Bengaluru, specific outlandish ideas like pod taxis, are being met with enthusiasm rather than scepticism, fills me with dread. This is one problem where there is a real need for something incremental and not something ‘innovative’. Every startup, once they have identified the important problem that they want to solve, and have come up with a product that they believe best solves the problem, should ask themselves a couple of questions. Is this way of solving the problem practical enough? And importantly, does it build upon something that already exists? Let us leave the moonshots to Musk. The real success for startups lies in being attuned to the ground situation. The author heads product at a mid-sized startup in the real estate space|0|

The best of world cinema in 2018|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Cinema can breed a peculiar rapaciousness — the more you feed on images, the more voracious your appetite becomes. In a year where I could feast on a lot more than usual, I still couldn’t savour a bunch — Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck’sNever Look Away, Benedikt Erlingsson'sWoman At War, Marcelo Martinessi’sThe Heiresses, Tamara Jenkins’Private Lifeto name just a few. Of the lot that were seen, many have registered strongly in the mind’s eye. These five films, however, were singular, and united, in laying bare the human condition and examining individuals and relationships with immense profundity, astuteness and wisdom. They were also, coincidentally, about families and sororities. Alfonso Cuaron’s RomaIt’s common to fall in love with a film but rare to get swept over by one.Romahas been that exception. Cuaron’s intensely personal love letter to his nanny, that he has said to have made with memory as a tool, is like a reverie on screen. Like it happens in a dream there is precision and geometry of arrangement to every luminous black and white image. It is for each of us to read our own meaning—be it the aircraft’s reflection in the splashing water, the high jumps and the ginormous amount of poo produced by the family dog Borrus or the funny attempt to park a huge car in a narrow veranda. Be it the foreground or the background, there is persistent activity that fills the seemingly placid frames even as the narrative moves from one caringly mapped-out situation to another. Romais a sweeping, all-embracing tale about the intensely tragic turbulences that creep up in life, leave you shaken but also stronger and more resilient. There are films that serenade you for a while,Romais a keeper. Barry Jenkins’ If Beale Street Could TalkThe rush and passion of young love, the rhythm, innocence and intense beauty of a couple’s first brush with intimacy, the delicate dance of the bodies... Barry Jenkins creates glorious romance on screen in a manner reminiscent of Wong Kar Wai. Only Jenkins could have looked at the fractious issue of race relations in this characteristic gentle, genteel and abundantly graceful way. Hirokazu Kore-eda’s ShopliftersAre families a biological inheritance or can we cobble them together as we move along in life? It’s a complex thought that lies at the core of a seemingly simpleShoplifters.A family of thieves takes a little girl, who has been hurt and abused in her home, under its wings. Will this love and affection that comes from her new parents and siblings last a lifetime or remain just a short tryst? Often called the true inheritor of the legacy of Yasujirō Ozu, Kore-eda has been candid about putting familial ties persistently under the scanner. Nuri Bilge Ceylan’s The Wild Pear TreeTextured and rivetingly shot in long takes, resting heavy on several probing conversations and resounding metaphors (like the persistent digging of a well), Nuri Bilge Ceylan’s ode to fathers and sons is the unheralded masterpiece of 2018. A young man returns home from college only to find it hard to fit back in to the family that has been battling with the debts of his father. He has his own worries about the future—being a writer and a teacher but without a job for the moment. Yorgos Lanthimos’s The FavouriteThree scorching women at its core and men turned perfunctory, the delectable tale of a strange sorority—Queen Anne, her confidant and advisor Duchess of Marlborough Sarah Churchill, and Sarah’s cousin Abigail Hill—is the most refreshingly wicked and irreverent film of the year. The ladies are brutally immoral, ambitious, manipulative and transgressive but not once does the filmmaker, or the audience, turn judgmental. The Anne, Sarah and Abigail triangle is less about love and affection, more about deceit and betrayals because relationships here are not sacred, merely a tool used for political one-upmanship.|0|

Ricky Kej, Grammy-winning musician|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|In this time and age, all of us are on the phones. The ambient sounds of our streets, the music in the clubs we frequent to relax are also very loud and not safe for the ears. As a musician, having an audience that can hear well and make out the nuances of different strands of music is very important. I would want a tech tool encoded in our phones, that allows us to measure the sounds we listen to on a daily basis and can issue warnings if we exceed the permissible limits. This is very important, since there is a good chance that people with hearing loss issues may not realise there is an issue that needs immediate attention. What’s out there? Using a noise-cancelling headphone might be helpful and may offer short-term solutions. Since a sound counter is not yet in the works, it would be a good idea to listen on earphones/headphones with the volume turned down, and moderate the use of these devices.|0|

Technical throwbacks|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|2018 was a year that saw the rise and fall of cryptocurrencies, brought about conversations on the manner in which machine learning and artificial intelligence are going to change lives, and home automation emerged as a new buzzword in India. We take a look at some of the trends and gadgets that defined the year that has gone by in the tech sphere. Cryptocurrency When the year began, Bitcoin was the main topic of discussion, especially in the tech sphere. Everyone was reading up, listening to or talking about the complex world of blockchain and how it works, and many were invested in the idea of a universal currency not controlled by any government. Crypto was soon projected as the next big thing, that will change the way we perceive money. However, strict government control across the planet, security issues plaguing the security of the cryptocurrency meant that Bitcoin lost about 70% of its initial value over the year and the short-lived bubble went bust. In India, after initial hoopla and outrage over cryptocurrency usage, the reaction to the drop in the value of Bitcoin is rather muted. Indian drones fly out While elsewhere drones are being used for everything from delivering essential medicines and conducting agricultural surveys to delivering hamburgers from a nearby joint, in India, drone usage was banned. This blanket ban was finally lifted, albeit partially last month. Drone startups and companies are confident that these set of regulations and the upcoming ones will ensure that drone usage in India will take off in the right manner. Now, to check out some of the devices that impressed us the most this year. Apple iPad Pro After the initial excitement, when the iPad first launched and was seen as a replacement to conventional desktops, it slipped from the collective imagination soon afterwards. Though upgrades did come, they were rather incremental. All this made the New iPad Pro quite a big deal. It features a liquid retina display and is equipped with Apple’s A12X Bionic chip and gets the Face ID feature. The processing power is excellent and it can do all the things a regular laptop or desktop can, without breaking into much of a sweat. For the creatively inclined, the new and improved Apple pen will be an added benefit. Mi TV 4A The Mi TV 4A Full HD 49 is an excellent device, with a 49-inch IPS panel. It is a smart TV that runs Xiaomi’s PatchWall platform for content curation and discovery. The user interface is excellent, gets you to pick content from multiple streaming platforms and so on. The regular Google home screen is also available for those not very familiar with the PatchWall. Though the TV offers crisp visuals and a very good viewing experience, it does not support Netflix or Prime at the moment. This can be easily circumvented by getting an Amazon Fire TV Stick or the latest iteration of the Chromecast. Amazon Echo Dot I am not very sold on the idea of smart speakers or virtual assistants yet, especially given that the functionality of these devices seldom goes beyond playing music to show guests how it works, especially in India. However, the new rounded Echo Dot is a winner in its own. It is smart, catches the Indian accent well, and does not shy away from offering music suggestions. It is a good device to make shopping lists on, set alarms, get an Uber and play music. Once food streaming platforms and other home automation tools make their mark in India, the Echo will be in huge demand.|0|

What lies beneath|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Going underground is always fun unless you are running away from the swamp monster or random serial killers. The underground resort, Guhantara, off Kanakapura Main Road, near Kaggalipura in South Bengaluru provides thrills in spades. The large auditorium and suites are 30 feet below ground. As you pass through village roads and come closer to your destination, do not expect to see cave-like structures. For, even after you reach Guhantara, you walk amidst lush green meadows on ground level. You go below ground gradually through long mud tunnels. The paths to the auditorium are lined with sculptures and frescoes. “Why not keep the nature intact and go underground” was the revolutionary thought that architects SN Ramesh and CH Ramesh of R-Square Designs in Bengaluru began with. They nurtured the dream for years. “We wanted to have a resort, but build it differently, says SN Ramesh. “By going underground we thought the idea of a rare man-made underground structure, resembling a cave would be an achievement. We called the resort Guhantara.” The duo researched for over a year before building in the quiet countryside at Kaggalipura. Entry to the cave The tunnels lead you to a central lounge with a gigantic, spider-like skylight for natural light to spread to the restaurant Sambhojana. The space doubles up as an amphitheatre, which can house nearly 750 people. A rocky waterfall forms the backdrop in this atrium-like space where artificial rain too is employed for rain-dance. “We employed new design techniques as a structure resembling a cave demanded new grammar in our thinking,” says SN Ramesh. For the cave effect, the architects used ferro-cement concrete on moulds of natural rocks. The ceiling is plastered with cement and mud, and the concrete floors mimic wooden flooring. Guhantara has dark textured earthen-finished roofs in stone and its rock-like walls adds to its rough plastered appeal. The walls of cave-rooms are adorned with rangoli art, with all the modern conveniences merging into the décor. The rooms have attached wash rooms and a balcony facing the pool. “The resort offers a bunch of outdoor activities and sports,” say IT professionals Diwakar Rao and Shyamala who travelled to Guhantara with their team from Hyderabad. If you are outdoorsy, you could try your hand at rope walks, zipline, wall-climbing, badminton, beach volleyball and bow and arrows. For those who prefer being indoors, there is snooker, chess and carom as well as a fish spa. Guhantara has very less plywood and veneer, and is designed to work as a geo-thermal air conditioner. Solar energy is harnessed for power and the ozone water-treatment plant feeds the lawns and the water bodies inside.|0|
Professor Raveesha KH, Head of Department of Physics, CMR Institute of Technology|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Professor Raveesha loves to interact with his students to find out what could be the latest inventions in tech. He suggests that mobile phones could be upgraded even more. “My tech wishlist would be a mobile phone with a telescope,” he says. “The common man would be able to take photographs of the moon and see what is on its surface. It would be beneficial for students interested in astronomy and the defence sector. I think Apple would design such a phone in the near future.” Addressing the universal problem of charging mobile phones while on-the-go, Professor Raveesha says, “I also wish for long-charging mobile phone batteries that will last for a month. Long-lasting batteries will not only be convenient for the common man, but would also be of use to space engineers.” What’s out there? There are laptops that run on solar energy. It needs to become more popular and I am sure it will soon!|0|

‘I killed my youth working’|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Harris Jayaraj’s Studio H at Valasaravakkam is an impressive structure with plenty of open spaces inside. There are a few office rooms, which lead you to a garden and swimming pool. Harris’ residence is right behind — he can quickly saunter over if a tune needs fixing. The composer had a quiet 2018, but he had a good end to the year, with the release ofDev’s album. In an interview, he chats about the film’s songs, staying relevant and why his songs tend to sound similar. Excerpts: You’ve mentioned earlier how your relationship with directors is important. WhenDev’s director Rajath Ravishankar came to you, what struck you about him and the subject? I liked the story and thought that I could justify it musically. I firmly believe that the director is the captain of the ship... he is responsible for everything! (laughs) Rajath had a certain vision and he could envision the film in his head. The producer (Lakshman Kumar) was also passionate about it. I see the director and producer as husband and wife. We are their kids! Would you callDeva return to the brand of music Harris is known for? I don’t know if I would describe it as a ‘brand of music’, but composing for young films has always been my favourite. I love to write music for young subjects. We can work from our heart, have fun with the score, and do not need to follow ‘Kodambakkam rules’ while doing so. I come from that school of music — all my songs in the films of Gautham Menon and Jeeva have been like that. Unfortunately, I haven’t seen a genuine young film for the past 10 years. But you didNanban... But that’s for a Superstar. It was the character of a young chap played by a superstar. This meant that we had to fulfil fans’ expectations. But if you listen toUllam Ketkumae,12Bor evenDev, you’ll know how we are not forced to come up with even one track for the hero, which was not part of the storyline. Is it fair to say that you have been concentrating on quality rather than quantity in the last couple of years? I’ve been doing that for the past 18 years, ever since I started composing for films. I don’t count my films, but it is rather easy to count. I hardly work on more than three films a year. In fact, in 2009, I had only one release (Orange). The reason for that is simple: when I got launched as a composer withMinnale, I was very tired... because I had already worked as a musician for more than 600 films, in several languages. When I was a keyboard player, I used to finish a film within a couple of days. When you rush things, you forget ‘quality’ and concentrate on how many projects you took up. I believe that I killed my youth working. So when I débuted as composer, I told myself that I’d concentrate only on quality. A film can fail at the box office, but music won’t. Aren’t there so many songs we revisit in films we don’t even know the name of? You created a fresh soundscape withMinnale. How did you bypass ‘Kodambakkam rules’ of the time? I was lucky to have the support and vision of a director like Gautham Menon, and producer Murali Manohar. The success ofMinnale’s soundtrack proved that audiences liked to hear something different, something that didn’t go with the usual ‘Kodambakkam music grammar’ of the time. That gave way to albums like12BandUnnale Unnale.I’m also fortunate that senior directors like Murugadoss and Shankar accepted my style of music. Today, there’s a new music composer in Kollywood almost every Friday. Do you see this crowded space as a threat? I see it in a positive way. The scenario now gives opportunities to many musical talents. Every composer gets his share, based on his talent and earlier successes. I don’t see anyone scooping any other person’s projects.  A common criticism for your songs is that they tend to sound similar. See, that’s my signature. If someone hears a song of mine and immediately says that it is a Harris number, it means that I’ve succeeded. Every composer has a signature — you can play any track of Hans Zimmer to me, and I’ll know it’s his work without you telling me. Are there occasions when you have worked on a single number for a long time? If you are overdoing a song, it means that there is something basically wrong with the tune. Just because you work on a tune for 100 days doesn’t mean that it will become a superhit. Magic happens within a single recording session. Finally, I have seen many Tamil stand-up comedians taking friendly jibes at your music. Are you aware of these? Yes, I have watched those videos. It’s their way of putting things together. I appreciate their talent, but not the intention.  Karthi kept telling me that he needed to look really good if he were to do a film that had my songs. Thankfully,Devbrought us together|0|
Mend it like a pro|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Four days in a week, Antara Mukherji's bag is packed with a saw, a sewing kit, an insulation tape and all the other paraphernalia readily associated with a plumber, electrician or any odd-jobs person. With this kit, she is now visiting a school near Old Airport Road where she would be “fixing” things for a while. She is part of Repair Cafe Bengaluru, a community of repair enthusiasts. Repair Cafe has turned three and is now trying to extend its reach, targeting city schools. That's where volunteers like Antara come in. She and another volunteer are currently working with students to have two defunct speakers at this school near Old Airport Road repaired. Before this, they upcycled a few unused furniture items and revived a bamboo structure. Love of learning  “The children are thirsty for knowledge,” says Antara of the group she is working with. Using media like art and drama, children are introduced to repairs and made to play handyman. Antara is a co-founder of Repair Cafe Bengaluru. All that volunteers of Repair Cafe Bengaluru want from the schools is permission to let them set up repair labs on their campuses that would show children how to mend things. “We have such a throwaway culture that we have forgotten the joy of repairing,” says Purna Sarkar, co-founder of Repair Cafe Bengaluru. The three-month to one-year module with schools provide basic skills while prompting youngsters to think about the value of the things around them. Repair Cafe has worked with the Government High School at Jeevan Bheema Nagar on a “kali-kalisu” project sponsored by India Foundation for the Arts (IFA). Earth School in Cooke Town also invited them. A book on repairs for children by Pratham Books is also ready. The journey When Antara and Purna brought Repair Cafe to the city in 2015, there were some challenges. “When we first started, we brought professionals to repair things. Now, we have many volunteers, at least 10 on a regular basis, in the age group of 17 to 70,” says Purna, who loves fixing jewellery. Seventy four-year-old Bharath Kumar dabbles in mechanical and automobile repairing. He also conducts sessions for homemakers on basic repair work, including replacing the fuse or changing the washer. Seventeen-year-old Naren V.R. helps fix electronic appliances. Turning point When they decided to move repair cafés to public spaces, the tide turned. They have so far conducted 29 workshops, taking the concept to various neighbourhoods. They are also a part of Cycle Day. “This is a big achievement as Repair Cafe International usually sits at one place,” says Purna. When a Repair Cafe gets closer to the community it is meant to serve, the response is amazing. “At Ranka Plaza in Wheeler Road, we sat in a garage and the residents helped us get people to come with items that needed repairs. People not only brought things to be mended, but also got involved in the process,” says Purna. The money generated from each of the workshops is used for the next one. “We also ask for donations to cover our expense,” says Purna. For details, email [email protected]. Follow them atfacebook.com/ Repaircafe080Bangalore How it works How it works   Repair Cafes serve as a meeting place where people find tools, material and people to help carry out repairs on clocks, cycles, knick-knacks, small appliances and clothes.   The ultimate objective of these cafés is to promote a sustainable society.   Martine Postma initiated Repair Cafe and held the first one in Amsterdam in 2009. She later started the Repair Cafe Foundation, a non-profit organisation.   There are 1500 Repair Cafes worldwide, and Bengaluru is the only Indian city to have one.|0|

Indian superhero capers|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Vishwas Mudagal wears many hats, as the CEO and co-founder of GoodWorkLabs, a motivational speaker and an author. He has recently come out with his second book,The Last Avatar, a tale set in a dystopian future with mythology and threads of science fiction, with an Indian superhero trying to save the world. The book is the first instalment of a three-part trilogy. In a free-wheeling interview, he speaks about the book and the nascent superhero culture in India. The inspiration The Last Avataris filled with references to mythology and has elements of science-fiction in it too. It has taken me eight years of research, writing, rewriting and practically living this book to create the last avatar, Kalki in flesh and blood. The book was inspired by the geopolitical rumblings happening globally and is set in a dystopian future, where the entire leadership of the country is wiped out and Kalki emerges as the only hope against the forces of evil. He is trained by a secret society. Growing popularity of mythology I believe mythology has always been a favourite in India. We have had a tradition of epics such as Ramayana and Mahabharata. People in India are rooted in mythology as a culture. We want to see a battle of good versus evil and good triumphing over evil. These are the reasons for the growing interest in the epics. Superheroes in India It is sad that superheroes are non-existent in India. It is mainly because we do not have a comic book culture. Due to the influx of Hollywood superheroes, we have complex storylines and high-quality content pouring in from outside the country. We need Indian superheroes rooted in our culture and ethos. That is something I wanted to fix. I was tired of Hollywood superheroes and decided to bring a true Indian superhero.  Characters with shades of grey I think it is challenging and helps bring out a unique angle to their personality that drives their motives and ambitions.|0|

Taking the right steps|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|How many of you train to build muscle, asked Sheela Nambiar to a 30-plus audience full of Bharatanatyam dancers. One hand went up. Sheela, fitness guru and the author of books likeGain to LoseandGet Size Wise: Training for Life for the Indian Woman, looked at her audience disapprovingly for a moment, and then broke into a smile. “The key to weight loss is to build muscle,” she says, “Dance alone does not help you do that. The human body is very clever: for artistes like you, it recognises dance as part of your daily activity and not as a separate fitness activity. Fitness is different from dance.” In a while, she showed them how it was. Sheela made the dancers sweat it out, literally, by getting them to do planks and lunges, even as she stressed the importance of a warm-up before dancing sessions. A few of them got the fitness steps right, while others huffed and puffed, thanks to the unfamiliar stretches. “As dancers, all of you have a high level of body intelligence. You need to understand how body parts work in relation to one other.” Sheela was speaking as part of a workshop at the 38th Natya Kala Conference, conceptualised by city dancer Srinidhi Chidambaram. “To dance, one needs to be fit,” said Srinidhi, “But we tend to use some muscles a lot more than others. Our posture on stage is also unique — we just don’t stand or sit but squat. This posture is bound to affect us in some way, and we must concentrate on fitness to set it right.” Srinidhi went down memory lane to the time when she started dancing, almost four decades ago. “Back then, we didn’t devote any time for warm-ups or stretches. In fact, it was frowned upon as unnecessary.” Sheela sought to correct that very notion, as she stressed on how hitting the gym to build muscle is important for dancers too. “Sometimes, people think that building muscle can make you less feminine, less graceful. That isn’t true. The fact is that the more muscular you are, the less chances you have of gaining weight as you age.”  Dance trail Fournattuvanars— Ponnaiya, Vadivelu, Sivanandam and Chinnaiya — who thrived in the durbar of Maratha ruler Serfoji II, are said to have laid the foundations of modern-day Bharatanatyam.|0|

Potpourri at the cinemas|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST| The NTR biopic headlined by Balakrishna took an entirely different turn the moment director Krish Jagarlamudi stepped in. The director also wrapped upManikarnikaas soon as possible and gave this film all the attention he could. No one doubts Krish’s capabilities and the production house reportedly too took great care of the cast and crew. So happy was Vidya Balan that she distributed sweets to the entire team on the last day of shoot. She worked for 15 days. Bharath Reddy played Daggubati Venkateswara Rao, Daggubati Raja as NTR’s brother, Sumanth as Akkineni Nageswara Rao and Rana Daggubati as Chandrababu Naidu. Purandareswari’s character , is being essayed by a new artiste; other characters include those like T Anjaiah and Kotla Vijaybhaskar Reddy. The first partKathanayakuduis about NTR’s journey in cinema till he turns to politics and the second partMahanayakududeals with his political career. Brace up for the release of these two parts in January and February.  AfterSrimanthuduandBharat Ane Nenu, Mahesh Babu will be seen in this film directed by Vamsi Paidipally.Maharshiis said to deal with issues like organic farming and friendship. Sources state that one can expect a bond on the lines of Krishna-Kuchela, with Allari Naresh playing the part of man going through a bad patch and gets help from his childhood buddy. Mahesh, who plays a character that lives in the US, returns on learning that his friend whose survival depends on agriculture is facing a crisis. .  Samantha had a great 2018 and is using that position to steer away from the routine. Expect to see her shine in director Shiva Nirvana’sMajiliinwhich she stars alongside Naga Chaitanya. Samantha is also shooting for director Nandini Reddy’sOh Baby, Yentha Sakkagunnavewhich is a remake of the Korean filmMiss Granny, a promising watch in summer 2019.  Political biopics are tricky — likePeriyar, IruvarandGandhi, so it will be interesting to see how the audience reconnects with YSR’s story inYatra. Eyeing the poll year for Andhra Pradesh, director Mahi Raghav’s film starring Mammootty as YSR aims high. Towards the end of 2019, the clash between the NTR and YSR biopics will be discussed. Mammooty returns to Telugu cinema after 25 years.  The revenue and expectations of Telugu films postBaahubalihave increased worldwide. Prabhas-starrerSaaho, directed by Sujeeth, is said to be a Hollywood-style project being made at more than Rs. 100 crore. Neil Nitin Mukesh, Vivek Oberoi and Shraddha Kapoor are part of the main cast and Sharad Kelkar who dubbed for Prabhas in the Hindi version ofBaahubaliwill do the honours forSaahoas well. As per the industry buzz,technically it is expected to raise the bar, and the stunt sequences will remind the audience ofFast And Furiousseries.  The sports drama starring Nani also looks at how personal relationships affect the game. Nani says it is one of the most honest scripts he came across and as soon as he heard the narration, he decided to take it up. Nani underwent training and put on some weight for the role. Incidentally, Nani had done another sports drama earlier. RememberBheemili Kabaddi Jattu?Jerseyis directed by Gautam Tinnanuri who made his debut withMalli Rava. Shraddha Srinath makes her debut in Telugu with this film.  Dr Rajashekar approached director Prasanth Varma even before the release of his debut filmAwe;he had a story that would be apt for him. The actor plays a character called Kalki in this investigative thriller, said to be a franchise, set in 1980s.Kalkiis expected to be a whodunnit likeByomkesh Bakshi. ThoughKalkihas many layers and references to the mythological character, it is a film that will not follow any template. Dr Rajashekar will be doing more action scenes than he did inGaruda Vega. A single shot action scene is being much talked about in industry circles. Adah Sharma and Nandita Shweta essay key characters.  History has it that Uyyalawada Narasimha Reddy was one of the first Indians to rebel against the British regime and demand freedom. The story of the Telugu freedom fighter from Rayalaseema who was hanged by the British is being brought to screen with Chiranjeevi essaying the titular role. The actor is in the right space to try such roles. After the success ofBaahubali, Chiranjeevi was confident that the risk of investing more than 100 crore on this historical subject would be worth it. It is alleged that the script was first offered by Paruchuri Brothers to Balakrishna postVamsodharakuduand director Jayant C Paranji was supposed to direct it at an estimated budget of Rs. 50 crore. Producer M S Reddy called it off, unconvinced by the financial prospects. Now years later,Sye Raahas been taken up by Konidela Productions and has a pan-Indian crew. Director Surender Reddy has a huge task at hand. Amitabh Bachchan had even posted a beautiful picture from the sets when he was in Hyderabad for the shoot.|0|
‘Buy less, choose well, make it last’|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Step out today, and you can overhear nervous conversations among people from all walks of life — ranging from vendors of all scales and backgrounds to their customers — about the ban of single-use disposable plastic in Tamil Nadu. Plastic has crept into our everyday lives and become a part of our routines. Many of us have been in denial of the ban and as a result, are not geared up to make the necessary swaps. People who are already doing their bit to lead a plastic free, and minimal impact lifestyle, tell us how:  “Almost every environmental issue can be linked to human consumption,” says Amala Aiana. “It is empowering to think ‘I have enough’.” Amala began by researching about communities and individuals who were constructively working towards curbing consumption, managing, and reducing waste. She started using what she had for the renewables, and for what she didn’t have, started reasoning between what she ‘wants’ and what she ‘needs’. Amala’s biological intolerance to processed products was a blessing in disguise which enabled her and the family to switch to organic food and terrace gardening. This eliminated most packaged oils, pulses, honey, vegetables and fruits from their everyday lives.  Without compromising on her personal care needs, Amala discovered brands that leave a minimal carbon footprint by switching to plant-based alternatives, often in powder form that eliminate most plastic packaging, chemicals and preservatives. “One of the easiest switches was compostable bamboo toothbrushes,” she says. Amala tries to make mindful purchases wherever possible by picking brands like Lush that give one the opportunity to return the packaging after use. She resides in Valmiki Nagar, where the like-minded community encourages and supports in reducing, segregating and disposing waste. She also carries her own metal water bottle, dismisses straws when ordering a drink, refuses freebies that just pile up and carries her own shopping bag. “Although I understand we have little control individually, I believe each one of us can set the wheels in motion for positive change around us.”  Dhaval is one of the founders of Chennai’s first vegan store, Earth Story. He is also an example of adapting sustainability and mindful living. “I stay in Auroville, in a zero-waste community where reducing things and segregating waste is an integral part of the ecosystem. We have different disposal systems for paper, glass, food waste, plastic and other inorganic waste,” he says. Dhaval believes in investing in the right products. He lives by the famous words of Vivienne Westwood — ‘Buy less, choose well, make it last’. The ‘R’ that he prioritises is Refuse. He believes that no matter how sustainable a single use disposable material is, it must be refused and replaced with something reusable. “I plan my day in advance and make sure I carry the things that align with my values. For example, if I have to shop for grocery on my way from work, I carry my own bag even though the shops offer me paper bags,” he says. He has let go of business cards and encourages e-bills over printed ones. At his store, everyday grocery and supplies also come in a bring-your-own-container alternative to avoid unnecessary packaging. “It all starts with being mindful and making it a habit.”  With the division of roles and responsibilities at home, one of the things Srilatha takes charge of is buying fruits, vegetables, snacks and other monthly groceries. She starts by picking small and local vendors who provide goods in bulk, therefore having no packaging of their own. She equips herself with reusable stainless steel containers, bottles, jars and cloth bags before she heads out to shop. “I use cloth bags that I receive as return gifts or stitch them myself from old clothes.” Srilatha also makes it a point to educate every shopkeeper she interacts with on the problems associated with packaging, so that they encourage their customers to follow the ‘bring your own container/packaging’ principle. For the few items that Srilatha does buy with packaging, she makes it a point to return it to the store to be reused/recycled. “Always choose fresh juices that can be filled in your own packaging over pre-packed aerated drinks in plastic bottles. I also grow my greens and vegetables at home and like experimenting with homegrown produce. Some of them include spinach, bitter gourd, curry leaves and native vegetables,” she says. She encourages her family to carry food from home to work, thus tackling the single-use disposables that come with ordering food. She believes that our traditional practices will make us zero-wasters. Sudarshana and Veena are sustainability entrepreneurs. They are the co-founders of Two’s Company and Everwards India. This is the second in a series of articles on the plastic ban.  Go for  Soapnuts instead of detergent  Goods packaged with paper  Coir utensil scrubbers Cotton bags Upcycled bags  Mindful packaging  Homegrown greens   No matter how sustainable a single-use disposable material is, it must be refused and replaced with something reusable|0|
On the wrong sort of innovation|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The one thing that is common to all successful startups is that they identify a very real problem that enough consumers or businesses have, and then provide a solution that is significantly better than the current way the consumers or businesses are dealing with the problem. It does not matter whether you are a B2C startup or a B2B startup, this is the bare minimum that your startup should be doing if it has to have any chance of success. Of course, this is only a necessary and not a sufficient condition for success. There are far more startups that have identified a real problem and have come up with a solution that is better than any extant solution, than those that have been successful. Yes, there is always that ineffable thing called luck which is a factor. But keeping luck aside, there is another important factor that a lot of startups fail to take into account, and often end setting themselves up for failure. It is this near-obsessive need to be doing something that is radically different, a need to solve the entire problem from scratch and not build upon something that already exists. Elon Musk gets stuck in traffic? He decides to bore mega tunnels underneath cities to set up a new and hideously expensive variety of (not really mass) public transit. Sometimes, this obsession manifests itself slightly differently. Entrepreneurs get obsessed with whatever the ecosystem defines as hot when it comes to innovation. Last year, it was cryptocurrency. This year, it is things like Artificial Intelligence, data science and so on. So your startup may be using only a few Excel sheets, but you will claim it is AI, and soon enough start believing in that lie too. I can, unfortunately, see manifestations of this wrong kind of obsession in a lot of important real-world problems in India that more likely than not are going to be solved by successful startups. The most prominent among these problems is that of end-to-end commuting in urban cities. Taking a person from their home to their workplace, and then back home again. Or the adjacent problem of heavy traffic in such cities. That ideas like personal transporters, electric scooters and their variants, which may be faddish in pockets of the developed world right now, and in the case of Bengaluru, specific outlandish ideas like pod taxis, are being met with enthusiasm rather than scepticism, fills me with dread. This is one problem where there is a real need for something incremental and not something ‘innovative’. Every startup, once they have identified the important problem that they want to solve, and have come up with a product that they believe best solves the problem, should ask themselves a couple of questions. Is this way of solving the problem practical enough? And importantly, does it build upon something that already exists? Let us leave the moonshots to Musk. The real success for startups lies in being attuned to the ground situation. The author heads product at a mid-sized startup in the real estate space|0|

Ricky Kej, Grammy-winning musician|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|In this time and age, all of us are on the phones. The ambient sounds of our streets, the music in the clubs we frequent to relax are also very loud and not safe for the ears. As a musician, having an audience that can hear well and make out the nuances of different strands of music is very important. I would want a tech tool encoded in our phones, that allows us to measure the sounds we listen to on a daily basis and can issue warnings if we exceed the permissible limits. This is very important, since there is a good chance that people with hearing loss issues may not realise there is an issue that needs immediate attention. What’s out there? Using a noise-cancelling headphone might be helpful and may offer short-term solutions. Since a sound counter is not yet in the works, it would be a good idea to listen on earphones/headphones with the volume turned down, and moderate the use of these devices.|0|

Manu Nair, Corporate executive chef, Billionsmiles|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|A restaurant spends a lot of time every day in deciding kitchen assignments, drawing up duty charts, getting things in place to reduce wastage of resources and so on, I would want a tech tool that can do all these functions, compute the menu lists, assign people to different sections and take steps to ensure that food wastage does not occur, if specific numbers are keyed into the device. It will help the industry a lot. What’s out there? Platforms such as apicbase.com have food management solutions on the cloud that can offer many solutions to these issues. To reduce food wastage, applications like Winnow can help. This UK-based startup uses a touchscreen tablet to identify what the kitchen staff put in the bin. An electronic scale records the weight and sends a message to the user, giving the cost of the food they’ve put in the bin. The meter is connected to cloud software which records and analyses the day’s waste. This gives owners and managers the information necessary to drive improvements in their system.|0|

Professor Raveesha KH, Head of Department of Physics, CMR Institute of Technology|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Professor Raveesha loves to interact with his students to find out what could be the latest inventions in tech. He suggests that mobile phones could be upgraded even more. “My tech wishlist would be a mobile phone with a telescope,” he says. “The common man would be able to take photographs of the moon and see what is on its surface. It would be beneficial for students interested in astronomy and the defence sector. I think Apple would design such a phone in the near future.” Addressing the universal problem of charging mobile phones while on-the-go, Professor Raveesha says, “I also wish for long-charging mobile phone batteries that will last for a month. Long-lasting batteries will not only be convenient for the common man, but would also be of use to space engineers.” What’s out there? There are laptops that run on solar energy.

What we see in the stars|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|We’ve often seen actors playing larger-than-life characters on the big screen. But what if their life-sized characters were shrunk to tiny models? This was the moot question that drove iKix My3D to create miniature models of famous personalities, including the late Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa, Rajinikanth, Kamal Haasan, Vijay Sethupathi and Anirudh Ravichander, to mention a few. iKix India, a company that has been employed in the business of designing 3D architectural models for over a decade, started its sister concern — iKix My3D — in April 2018, with the purpose of creating 3D printed replicas of celebrities for its customers. “Since we are experienced in architectural modelling, we thought of creating 3D character models, which have become big in the US. And that’s how our journey began,” says Praveen Daniel, Location Head, iKix My3D. Taking us through the designing process, Daniel says that the company roped in a bunch of digital sculptures, who were trained in graphic designing softwares like Maya. Behind the walls Given that Tamil Nadu is a State that worships cine stars, it isn’t surprising that the statuettes of Tamil film personalities are a hit among customers. But the company’s speciality lies in its customised figurines that come with a predefined shape and size. For instance, if someone wants his/her own miniature model, then he/she is asked to send their photos to iKix My3D. The designers, after taking a good look at the photos, develop the front and side views first. A rough sketch is sent back to the customer for confirmation. After getting it approved, the designing team creates the entire model, which is later sent for printing using the 3D printer. “Our competitors use FDM 3D printing, while we use sandstone. When we get the photos, we start printing them layer-by-layer,” says Thayumanavan, one of the designers. According to Thayumanavan, the whole process usually takes a week, “There are a lot of options for customised figurines. Either they can select from the available models or specify their own requirements.” The company was flooded with orders of customised Santa Claus figurines for Christmas. “If you look at any household during Christmas, people will invariably use the same Santa Claus doll every year. With our 3D modelling, we are able to merge our customer’s face on to the Santa itself,” says Daniel, adding that the Santa models were selling like hot cakes in the US. Sure, the figurines look adorable. But not everybody can afford them, because the models are targeted for a particular sect — middle and upper middle class. Priced between Rs. 2,000 and Rs. 9,000, customers are charged depending on the size of the object. “There’s a difference between plastic and ceramic. Yes, we can produce the models at Rs. 1,000. But we don’t want to do that. For natural look and feel, you shouldn’t think twice about spending a few extra notes,” he adds. Say hi to 3.0 WhenEnthiranreleased in 2010, Praveen Daniel was contemplating the idea of creating a miniature model of the eponymous character 2.0, played by Rajinikanth. The dust has settled, and Praveen and his team have now designed the miniature version of 3.0, the tiny robot from the recently-released2.0. “On the 100th day celebration, we’re planning to gift our models to the2.0team,” says Daniel, adding that they have already received a huge order from Malaysia for the Rajinikanth statuette. The 3.0 models, in particular, are being sold at Rs. 2,000-3,000. iKix My3D models can be ordered online.

Another world in the city|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Clad in an orange spacesuit, an astronaut — unidentifiable by name — runs across an arid land with seemingly-threatening smoke rising between the heaps of dirt. The bass thrums with every step the astronaut takes, and one can tell there’s an urgency in his movements. In the background is a haunting and profound narration speaking of existentialism. This isThe Countdown, a science-fiction short made in Hyderabad, which will premiere today. Karthik MSN first ideated forThe Countdownwhen a friend showed him a harrowing article on how everyone in the world would be wearing oxygen masks in 15 years, due to the ever-worsening global climate crises. The creative and technical forces behind the film lie in the hands of three young men, director Karthik, assistant director D Chaitanya Sharma and actor D Chanakya Sharma. “I honestly couldn’t have done it without Chaitanya and Chanakya,” applauds Karthik. According to Karthik , who has a background in documentary filmmaking paired with a passion for travel, describes the eight-and-a-half-minute film as, “A tale of hope or the story of survival of humanity. Being first of its kind in India, it is an experimental film in the science-fiction thriller genre, in which an astronaut stuck on an unknown planet struggles to get back to his ship only to find that things are actually worse than expected. The film also revolves around the subject of the future of life on the planet.” Despite his love for travel, he found the ideal place to film a budget-constrained short was in the city’s own backyard. The team also went all-in with their creativity, also crafting the astronaut suit from scratch. This, after copious research into the material and aesthetic for the sake of authenticity. They visited several industrial stores and Karthik recalls five days of stitching before the suit’s completion. Perfection was the key, and they weren’t willing to compromise one bit. Of course, budget was also a huge aspect. A lot of energy also went into prop creation, resorting to careful painting and texturisation to provide a rusted and post-apocalyptic feel. Environmentally, the boys were lucky to film at a mine in the city, having taken the right permissions. “The geology and the weather were on our side,” recalls Karthik, “because it happened to be raini; that created the smoky effects which we see in a lot of these science-fiction interplanetary films.” Making use of an environment to speak about the environment at length proves successful and Karthik is looking forward to wider reception. The team’s already done a few small screenings around the city and he’s been met with positive response. “The most common reaction is the shock of hearing that this film cost us barely $75,” he laughs, adding that he hopes this film can be a source of hope in a time when budgeting for shorts isn’t so easy to come by. Be sure to tune intoThe Countdownwhen it goes live on on YouTube on the production house’s channel Adwhyta.  The weather and geology were on our side because it happened to be raining (at the mine where we filmed) so that created the smoky effects|0|

What we see in the stars|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|We’ve often seen actors playing larger-than-life characters on the big screen. But what if their life-sized characters were shrunk to tiny models? This was the moot question that drove iKix My3D to create miniature models of famous personalities, including the late Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa, Rajinikanth, Kamal Haasan, Vijay Sethupathi and Anirudh Ravichander, to mention a few. iKix India, a company that has been employed in the business of designing 3D architectural models for over a decade, started its sister concern — iKix My3D — in April 2018, with the purpose of creating 3D printed replicas of celebrities for its customers. “Since we are experienced in architectural modelling, we thought of creating 3D character models, which have become big in the US. And that’s how our journey began,” says Praveen Daniel, Location Head, iKix My3D. Taking us through the designing process, Daniel says that the company roped in a bunch of digital sculptures, who were trained in graphic designing softwares like Maya. Behind the walls Given that Tamil Nadu is a State that worships cine stars, it isn’t surprising that the statuettes of Tamil film personalities are a hit among customers. But the company’s speciality lies in its customised figurines that come with a predefined shape and size. For instance, if someone wants his/her own miniature model, then he/she is asked to send their photos to iKix My3D. The designers, after taking a good look at the photos, develop the front and side views first. A rough sketch is sent back to the customer for confirmation. After getting it approved, the designing team creates the entire model, which is later sent for printing using the 3D printer. “Our competitors use FDM 3D printing, while we use sandstone. When we get the photos, we start printing them layer-by-layer,” says Thayumanavan, one of the designers. According to Thayumanavan, the whole process usually takes a week, “There are a lot of options for customised figurines. Either they can select from the available models or specify their own requirements.” The company was flooded with orders of customised Santa Claus figurines for Christmas. “If you look at any household during Christmas, people will invariably use the same Santa Claus doll every year. With our 3D modelling, we are able to merge our customer’s face on to the Santa itself,” says Daniel, adding that the Santa models were selling like hot cakes in the US. Sure, the figurines look adorable. But not everybody can afford them, because the models are targeted for a particular sect — middle and upper middle class. Priced between Rs. 2,000 and Rs. 9,000, customers are charged depending on the size of the object. “There’s a difference between plastic and ceramic. Yes, we can produce the models at Rs. 1,000. But we don’t want to do that. For natural look and feel, you shouldn’t think twice about spending a few extra notes,” he adds. Say hi to 3.0 WhenEnthiranreleased in 2010, Praveen Daniel was contemplating the idea of creating a miniature model of the eponymous character 2.0, played by Rajinikanth. The dust has settled, and Praveen and his team have now designed the miniature version of 3.0, the tiny robot from the recently-released2.0. “On the 100th day celebration, we’re planning to gift our models to the2.0team,” says Daniel, adding that they have already received a huge order from Malaysia for the Rajinikanth statuette. The 3.0 models, in particular, are being sold at Rs. 2,000-3,000. iKix My3D models can be ordered online.

Fashion reflection|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST| Ikat prints Swatti Kapoor, Consultant Designer, Jaypore, feels, “It is all about standing out and making a statement, and these unique prints do just that. In a sea of lookalikes, these are what you need.” They have made an appearance almost everywhere from crop tops and dresses to handbags and footwear. Handloom dresses Handloom has never been more stylish, and no, we aren’t just talking saris and salwar-suits. Wearing handloom dresses probably started off as a trend among the arty folks. Today, midis and ankle length handloom dresses, be it layered, straight-cut or asymmetrical, have caught the fancy of women of all ages, as they can be dressed up or down, depending on the occasion. Dark denims Never really out of fashion, indigo jeans have not been cooler because of their versatility. From a dark washed denim skirt to cropped jeans or even ones with a flared hem, dark denims suit everyone. Ruffles + micro floral prints “From casual tees to sexy dresses, from Indo-Western kurtis to high-fashion couture pieces, ruffles took over the fashion world this year. Besides ruffles, micro floral prints were a great way to kill monotony this year. Furthermore, florals were mixed with ruffles, to rule,” points out fashion blogger and founder of Advi, Pranita Mehta. Fanny packs and duffle bags Fanny/belt bags, duffle bags, cross body bags and backpacks were some of the best bag trends we witnessed in 2018,” says Dilip Kapur, Founder-President of Hidesign. He adds: “Belt bags are practical, functional and have a sophisticated and confident appeal. The versatility of leather duffel bags make them the perfect travel and luggage bags for many occasions.”  Cold shoulder outfits “The cold shoulder trend should have retired a long time ago. Adding it to Indian clothes is even worse,” says Swatti Kapoor. Concurring with her is ad stylist Trupti Nambiar, who says, “I personally loved this trend but I think there has been an overkill. Often the cuts are not made in the right manner. I have seen women wear tops like this but what is exposed are the upper arms instead of the shoulders.” Tiny sunglasses “What good are sunglasses if they don’t cover your eyes?” asks Pranita, adding, while they have been a good prop for clicking pictures and Priyanka Chopra, Beyoncé, Kendall Jenner, and the like looked good, tiny sunglasses don’t really serve the purpose. Fabric chokers Much like those ludicrous floral wreathes that were cute eons ago at beach weddings, mostly, fabric chokers had their time in the sun but that ship has definitely sailed. Trupti says, “If you want to wear a choker, it doesn’t have to be made of fabric. And why chokers when you have the option of wearing a classy necklace with a pendant or a layeredharamwith your ethnic/fusion outfits?” Kurta + jeans “Jeans with kurtas, while comfortable, are simply a lazy look,” according to Swatti. Given that there are umpteen pairing options for kurtas, from chic palazzos and dhoti pants to cropped cotton/linen trousers, college girls especially should break up with the kurta + jeans trend. Dad sneakers We love sneakers, just not dad sneakers. If you are wondering what we are talking about, they are those padded, oversized-looking lace-up trainers that millennials like Kendall Jenner took to. Top-end designers like Gucci, Alexander McQueen and Balenciaga came up with their own versions that cost a bomb. Who cares if they are designer shoes, if they are ugly?|0|
Manu Nair, Corporate executive chef, Billionsmiles|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|A restaurant spends a lot of time every day in deciding kitchen assignments, drawing up duty charts, getting things in place to reduce wastage of resources and so on, I would want a tech tool that can do all these functions, compute the menu lists, assign people to different sections and take steps to ensure that food wastage does not occur, if specific numbers are keyed into the device. It will help the industry a lot. What’s out there? Platforms such as apicbase.com have food management solutions on the cloud that can offer many solutions to these issues. To reduce food wastage, applications like Winnow can help. This UK-based startup uses a touchscreen tablet to identify what the kitchen staff put in the bin. An electronic scale records the weight and sends a message to the user, giving the cost of the food they’ve put in the bin. The meter is connected to cloud software which records and analyses the day’s waste. This gives owners and managers the information necessary to drive improvements in their system.|0|

Professor Raveesha KH, Head of Department of Physics, CMR Institute of Technology|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Professor Raveesha loves to interact with his students to find out what could be the latest inventions in tech. He suggests that mobile phones could be upgraded even more. “My tech wishlist would be a mobile phone with a telescope,” he says. “The common man would be able to take photographs of the moon and see what is on its surface. It would be beneficial for students interested in astronomy and the defence sector. I think Apple would design such a phone in the near future.” Addressing the universal problem of charging mobile phones while on-the-go, Professor Raveesha says, “I also wish for long-charging mobile phone batteries that will last for a month. Long-lasting batteries will not only be convenient for the common man, but would also be of use to space engineers.” What’s out there? There are laptops that run on solar energy. It needs to become more popular and I am sure it will soon!|0|
Ricky Kej, Grammy-winning musician|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|In this time and age, all of us are on the phones. The ambient sounds of our streets, the music in the clubs we frequent to relax are also very loud and not safe for the ears. As a musician, having an audience that can hear well and make out the nuances of different strands of music is very important. I would want a tech tool encoded in our phones, that allows us to measure the sounds we listen to on a daily basis and can issue warnings if we exceed the permissible limits. This is very important, since there is a good chance that people with hearing loss issues may not realise there is an issue that needs immediate attention. What’s out there? Using a noise-cancelling headphone might be helpful and may offer short-term solutions. Since a sound counter is not yet in the works, it would be a good idea to listen on earphones/headphones with the volume turned down, and moderate the use of these devices.|0|

Talking tech and tracking this year|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|As parents, we do a thorough background check about our help, babysitter and even the schools in which we enrol the kids. But how well do we know about the technologies with which we surround ourselves? Your phone, your child’s tab that he/she uses to play games and your virtual Home Assistant? Lately, these dangers in the online space have transitioned into the real world, and as parents, we need to step in. After all, how would you or the child react to having a random stranger sitting at home all day with you? That’s just what we are doing today, in this gadget-crazy world. As a mom to a 5-year-old, I often ask myself how safe my child is in today’s cyber-world. More eyes than necessary Ever since Facebook rolled out their Messenger Kids, it has been getting a lot of flak from cyber pundits, just like the Snap Map feature that is freaking out parents about their kids’ safety. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a tough concept to explain to kids, about how every small physical device can connect to the internet and identify itself to similar devices. How do I do it? From Amazon’s Echo to Google Home, AI-enabled home assistants rule the roost today. Nikita Sharma, a stay-at-home mom of a 2-year-old, states how these devices excite the kids and counts for fun family time, playing games together or listening to popular nursery rhymes. “If it means less screen-time and interactive learning for my child, I am all for it!” On one side, you wish this is the assistant you need to make your lives simpler, but ever wondered what threats they pose to your children? Perhaps we should, like Mark Zuckerberg, start taping our laptop and tablet’s camera and microphone. An incident in Portland in the USA earlier this year described how Alexa recorded a private conversation of a couple and sent it to a contact in their list without their permission. They were understandably petrified and vowed never to plug in such devices in their home again. The makers are still clueless about how this happened. Easy answers, but the learning has been found wanting Rajee Deepak, a techie mom of two kids, aged 11 and 9, says she lets them use the smartphone and virtual assistant Bixby, but with restrictions. “I am okay with them using it for the weather forecast, score or to play songs”. But just like all millennial moms, Rajee is worried if this will make the next-gen kids over-dependent on gadgets and virtual assistants. Studies such as ‘Robovie, you’ll have to go into the closet now: Children’s social and moral relationships with a humanoid robot’ by Shen Solace et al, state how these virtual ‘friends’ substitute your child’s real friends and why that’s not good. For those unfamiliar, Robovie developed by Vstone, is an adorable robot which can double as your kid’s best friend; crying, laughing and walking, all included. The act of searching for answers and learning in the process is lost when all you have to say is ‘Okay Google, tell me the spelling of photosynthesis’. This begs the question of whether or not a child will actually learn something tangible without relying on technology. Don’t get fooled by those privacy settings or the voice-recognition software. In mid-December, Rocco, a talking parrot, ordered itself some delicious snacks for Christmas through Alexa in Oxfordshire, when his owner wasn’t around and the Internet is having a hearty laugh! But it’s technology that’s having the final laugh in this cyber dilemma. The Drop-In feature in Amazon Echo is eavesdropping in a tech-guise! Agreed, it does help a new parent or when you need to check on the elders in your family, but the privacy risks and the complicated security issues outweigh the benefits it offers, leaving the customer confused. There’s also news of how Alexa has overheard ‘Christmas shopping lists’ from everyday conversations and purchases are being made directly from the linked bank accounts — without one even actually placing the order. Isn’t that scary? Soon would a LEGO purchase worth Rs. 30,000 be delivered to my doorstep just because I had a conversation with my child about it? Steps worth taking Be it the smartphone, iPad or even the home assistants, take a minute (or maybe more) to go through the privacy settings and enable the parental controls and safe search options. Don’t ignore this step and click ‘I agree’ blindly. Act smart. Switch off the voice-purchasing option or at least set a PIN to make it secure. The safer route would be to disable microphones and video camera options in your child’s devices. If you buy any of these virtual home assistants, go through their manuals and read about them thoroughly. Find out what are the ‘wake words’ for each device and ensure your conversations don’t include a lot of them, that can activate the device! Opt in for a safe and recommended parental control app. There are many trusted names in the market, such as TeenSafe, Life360, Kaspersky Safe Kids, Qustodio, Net Nanny among others, that help in web content filtering, app blocking, time management and location tracking. Don’t feel guilty for using one — even celebrity chef Jamie Oliver uses it to keep an eye on his children.   The right discourse So now you have brought home an Amazon Echo or a Google Home. Don’t keep it away from your kids or forbid them from using. Instead have a frank and open conversation with the kids. Explain to them how we never disclose our personal details to a random stranger and those pop-ups in your phone or tab are just that. Lay firm rules on the time spent interacting with these devices, so they remain a source of entertainment and don’t turn into the entertainment option for kids. Ask them to steer clear from camera-apps and games that involve disclosing their location and identity. Sandhya Balaji, a mom-blogger, says she explains to her sons (9 and 6 years old) how social networking platforms work. She says, “Increased outdoor activities have helped reduce their dependency on mobiles. I give them a reality check on how these addictive games and apps like Facebook can open the doors for cyberbullying or predatory strangers”. Having a frank chat laden with facts helps kids understand better.    Autocorrect addiction  According to a 2017 report byIndian Journal of Psychological Medicine, there was a presence of addiction for 1.3% for Internet (2% males and 0.6% females) and mobile phone overuse (4.1%–2.5% males and 1.5% females) in a sample study of 2755 individuals.|0|
On the wrong sort of innovation|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The one thing that is common to all successful startups is that they identify a very real problem that enough consumers or businesses have, and then provide a solution that is significantly better than the current way the consumers or businesses are dealing with the problem. It does not matter whether you are a B2C startup or a B2B startup, this is the bare minimum that your startup should be doing if it has to have any chance of success. Of course, this is only a necessary and not a sufficient condition for success. There are far more startups that have identified a real problem and have come up with a solution that is better than any extant solution, than those that have been successful. Yes, there is always that ineffable thing called luck which is a factor. But keeping luck aside, there is another important factor that a lot of startups fail to take into account, and often end setting themselves up for failure. It is this near-obsessive need to be doing something that is radically different, a need to solve the entire problem from scratch and not build upon something that already exists. Elon Musk gets stuck in traffic? He decides to bore mega tunnels underneath cities to set up a new and hideously expensive variety of (not really mass) public transit. Sometimes, this obsession manifests itself slightly differently. Entrepreneurs get obsessed with whatever the ecosystem defines as hot when it comes to innovation. Last year, it was cryptocurrency. This year, it is things like Artificial Intelligence, data science and so on. So your startup may be using only a few Excel sheets, but you will claim it is AI, and soon enough start believing in that lie too. I can, unfortunately, see manifestations of this wrong kind of obsession in a lot of important real-world problems in India that more likely than not are going to be solved by successful startups. The most prominent among these problems is that of end-to-end commuting in urban cities. Taking a person from their home to their workplace, and then back home again. Or the adjacent problem of heavy traffic in such cities. That ideas like personal transporters, electric scooters and their variants, which may be faddish in pockets of the developed world right now, and in the case of Bengaluru, specific outlandish ideas like pod taxis, are being met with enthusiasm rather than scepticism, fills me with dread. This is one problem where there is a real need for something incremental and not something ‘innovative’. Every startup, once they have identified the important problem that they want to solve, and have come up with a product that they believe best solves the problem, should ask themselves a couple of questions. Is this way of solving the problem practical enough? And importantly, does it build upon something that already exists? Let us leave the moonshots to Musk. The real success for startups lies in being attuned to the ground situation. The author heads product at a mid-sized startup in the real estate space|0|
Technical throwbacks|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|2018 was a year that saw the rise and fall of cryptocurrencies, brought about conversations on the manner in which machine learning and artificial intelligence are going to change lives, and home automation emerged as a new buzzword in India. We take a look at some of the trends and gadgets that defined the year that has gone by in the tech sphere. Cryptocurrency When the year began, Bitcoin was the main topic of discussion, especially in the tech sphere. Everyone was reading up, listening to or talking about the complex world of blockchain and how it works, and many were invested in the idea of a universal currency not controlled by any government. Crypto was soon projected as the next big thing, that will change the way we perceive money. However, strict government control across the planet, security issues plaguing the security of the cryptocurrency meant that Bitcoin lost about 70% of its initial value over the year and the short-lived bubble went bust. In India, after initial hoopla and outrage over cryptocurrency usage, the reaction to the drop in the value of Bitcoin is rather muted. Indian drones fly out While elsewhere drones are being used for everything from delivering essential medicines and conducting agricultural surveys to delivering hamburgers from a nearby joint, in India, drone usage was banned. This blanket ban was finally lifted, albeit partially last month. Drone startups and companies are confident that these set of regulations and the upcoming ones will ensure that drone usage in India will take off in the right manner. Now, to check out some of the devices that impressed us the most this year. Apple iPad Pro After the initial excitement, when the iPad first launched and was seen as a replacement to conventional desktops, it slipped from the collective imagination soon afterwards. Though upgrades did come, they were rather incremental. All this made the New iPad Pro quite a big deal. It features a liquid retina display and is equipped with Apple’s A12X Bionic chip and gets the Face ID feature. The processing power is excellent and it can do all the things a regular laptop or desktop can, without breaking into much of a sweat. For the creatively inclined, the new and improved Apple pen will be an added benefit. Mi TV 4A The Mi TV 4A Full HD 49 is an excellent device, with a 49-inch IPS panel. It is a smart TV that runs Xiaomi’s PatchWall platform for content curation and discovery. The user interface is excellent, gets you to pick content from multiple streaming platforms and so on. The regular Google home screen is also available for those not very familiar with the PatchWall. Though the TV offers crisp visuals and a very good viewing experience, it does not support Netflix or Prime at the moment. This can be easily circumvented by getting an Amazon Fire TV Stick or the latest iteration of the Chromecast. Amazon Echo Dot I am not very sold on the idea of smart speakers or virtual assistants yet, especially given that the functionality of these devices seldom goes beyond playing music to show guests how it works, especially in India. However, the new rounded Echo Dot is a winner in its own. It is smart, catches the Indian accent well, and does not shy away from offering music suggestions. It is a good device to make shopping lists on, set alarms, get an Uber and play music. Once food streaming platforms and other home automation tools make their mark in India, the Echo will be in huge demand.|0|

Little ones lead the way|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|The minimum temperature in Hyderabad has been oscillating between 9 and 11 and it’s rather easy to give early morning outdoor activities a miss. However, the chill didn’t stop more than 2000 children from participating in the third edition of Hyderabad Kids Run, organised by Hyderabad Runners Society. On Sunday morning, kids and parents turned up at HITEX for a morning of fun and fitness. The event aimed at encouraging an active lifestyle and family bonding and had participants engaging in the three different category runs. The 1km ‘Monfant’ category was for mothers carrying their infants below 24 months in sling bags for a distance of 1 km. The 2km ‘Chill Run’ saw children in the age group of 4 to 8 years take part, along with parents who walked with them. The 4km ‘Fantastic Run’ encouraged children between 8 to 12 years to run a distance of 4kms.|0|
Indian superhero capers|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Vishwas Mudagal wears many hats, as the CEO and co-founder of GoodWorkLabs, a motivational speaker and an author. He has recently come out with his second book, The Last Avatar, a tale set in a dystopian future with mythology and threads of science fiction, with an Indian superhero trying to save the world. The book is the is the first instalment of a three-part trilogy. In a free-wheeling interview, he speaks about the book and the nascent superhero culture in India.  On the book and the inspiration behind it The Last Avatar is filled with references to mythology and has elements of science-fiction in it too. It has taken me eight years of research, writing, rewriting and practically living this book—a journey of creating the last avatar, Kalki in flesh and blood. It was inspired by the geopolitical rumblings happening globally and is set in a dystopian future, where the entire leadership of the country is wiped out and Kalki emerges as the only hope against the forces of evil. He is trained by a secret society.  On mythology and its growing popularity in India I believe mythology has always been a favourite in India for many years. If you look at our culture and history, we have had a tradition of great epics and adventures such as Ramayana and Mahabharata. People in India are deeply rooted in mythology as a culture. We want to see a battle of good versus evil. At the end of the day, we want to see good triumph over evil. These are the reasons for the growing interest in the epics.  On superheroes in India It’s sad that superheroes are non-existent in India. It is mainly because we do not have a comic book culture. Due to the influx of Hollywood superheroes, we have complex storylines and high-quality content pouring in from outside the country. We need Indian superheroes deeply rooted in our culture and ethos. That’s something I wanted to fix. I was tired of Hollywood superheroes and decided to bring a true Indian superhero called Kalki.   On writing characters with shades of grey I always enjoy writing grey characters. I think that it is challenging and helps bring out a unique angle to their personality that drives their motives and ambitions.|0|
Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|From Hidetaka Miyazaki comes a new game that moves away from medieval horror and into the realm of ninjas and samurai.

The one-man band|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|“You hear of Sri Lankans migrating to Australia, but I’m probably the first Australian in this decade to migrate to Sri Lanka on a boat,” jokes Larry Hillin the middle of his performance in Chennai. While that claim may be debatable, there is no doubt that his solo act, live vocal looping, is the more obscure music style, at least in this part of the continent. Larry begins beatboxing, his vocal percussion setting a catchy beat. In front of him is a black recorder, which holds most of his attention: the looper. As soon as his audience at the cosy room starts grooving to his beat, he moves on to acapella string sounds, even as the percussive beats continue playing. As he records the rhythm, the previous beats play in a loop. One by one, he lays these bars on top of the other, until it is enough to resemble an entire band. That’s when he starts rapping. “This technique is called live vocal looping,” he explains later. “I first record the percussion, then the bass line, the rhythm, melody, and so on, each of which plays simultaneously in a loop. That way, I don't need any musical instruments.” His voice is enough. Thirty-four-year-old Larry was born to Sri Lankan parents, who were then working in Dubai. They moved to Australia when Larry was around two. He began vocal loop singing eight years ago. Before that, he had neither sung nor done beatboxing. In fact, he was a drummer with a band. “You know how they tell us migrants to ‘go back where we came from’? I decided to take that literally and find my roots in Sri Lanka,” he says. Before that however, he spent five years travelling the length and breadth of the country (Australia). “I wanted to see as much of Australia as possible before I left. I would move around, learning organic farming,” he says. Unfortunately, his solo nomadic lifestyle meant breaking up with his band. Vocal looping arose out of necessity. “I first tried my hand at looping with the iPod touch,” he recalls. He then sailed from Australia to Sri Lanka, making stops on the way in Thailand, and Indonesia, where he played whatever he had been experimenting with. Having stayed for two years in Sri Lanka, “I thought I’d start singing in Sri Lankan styles and what not, but it was such an all consuming thing to learn a new language, forget singing and writing songs in it,” he says, adding that some of the reggae beats, however, did influence him. On a lighter note When Larry sings on stage, his demeanour, more often than not, evokes a good deal of mirth. He even peppers the conversation between songs with observational humour. “I have been secretly experimenting with different kinds of audiences,” he admits, “because I'm working towards a one hour solo show of mostly comic storytelling.” A comic pretence, he has found, helps engage people in serious issues. And despite his humorous approach to them, most of his songs are a social commentary in some form. One song questions racism towards South Asian migrants in Australia. (‘Where are you originally from’? he says in an Aussie accent dipping with derision) while another talks about our cities’ ever-increasing plastic footprint.  Make a note Thehak gediya, usually made out of a conch shell, is used by Sri Lankan performers to announce the start of a ceremony or event.|0|

Professor Raveesha KH, Head of Department of Physics, CMR Institute of Technology|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Professor Raveesha loves to interact with his students to find out what could be the latest inventions in tech. He suggests that mobile phones could be upgraded even more. “My tech wishlist would be a mobile phone with a telescope,” he says. “The common man would be able to take photographs of the moon and see what is on its surface. It would be beneficial for students interested in astronomy and the defence sector. I think Apple would design such a phone in the near future.” Addressing the universal problem of charging mobile phones while on-the-go, Professor Raveesha says, “I also wish for long-charging mobile phone batteries that will last for a month. Long-lasting batteries will not only be convenient for the common man, but would also be of use to space engineers.” What’s out there? There are laptops that run on solar energy.

What we see in the stars|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|We’ve often seen actors playing larger-than-life characters on the big screen. But what if their life-sized characters were shrunk to tiny models? This was the moot question that drove iKix My3D to create miniature models of famous personalities, including the late Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa, Rajinikanth, Kamal Haasan, Vijay Sethupathi and Anirudh Ravichander, to mention a few. iKix India, a company that has been employed in the business of designing 3D architectural models for over a decade, started its sister concern — iKix My3D — in April 2018, with the purpose of creating 3D printed replicas of celebrities for its customers. “Since we are experienced in architectural modelling, we thought of creating 3D character models, which have become big in the US. And that’s how our journey began,” says Praveen Daniel, Location Head, iKix My3D. Taking us through the designing process, Daniel says that the company roped in a bunch of digital sculptures, who were trained in graphic designing softwares like Maya. Behind the walls Given that Tamil Nadu is a State that worships cine stars, it isn’t surprising that the statuettes of Tamil film personalities are a hit among customers. But the company’s speciality lies in its customised figurines that come with a predefined shape and size. For instance, if someone wants his/her own miniature model, then he/she is asked to send their photos to iKix My3D. The designers, after taking a good look at the photos, develop the front and side views first. A rough sketch is sent back to the customer for confirmation. After getting it approved, the designing team creates the entire model, which is later sent for printing using the 3D printer. “Our competitors use FDM 3D printing, while we use sandstone. When we get the photos, we start printing them layer-by-layer,” says Thayumanavan, one of the designers. According to Thayumanavan, the whole process usually takes a week, “There are a lot of options for customised figurines. Either they can select from the available models or specify their own requirements.” The company was flooded with orders of customised Santa Claus figurines for Christmas. “If you look at any household during Christmas, people will invariably use the same Santa Claus doll every year. With our 3D modelling, we are able to merge our customer’s face on to the Santa itself,” says Daniel, adding that the Santa models were selling like hot cakes in the US. Sure, the figurines look adorable. But not everybody can afford them, because the models are targeted for a particular sect — middle and upper middle class. Priced between Rs. 2,000 and Rs. 9,000, customers are charged depending on the size of the object. “There’s a difference between plastic and ceramic. Yes, we can produce the models at Rs. 1,000. But we don’t want to do that. For natural look and feel, you shouldn’t think twice about spending a few extra notes,” he adds. Say hi to 3.0 WhenEnthiranreleased in 2010, Praveen Daniel was contemplating the idea of creating a miniature model of the eponymous character 2.0, played by Rajinikanth. The dust has settled, and Praveen and his team have now designed the miniature version of 3.0, the tiny robot from the recently-released2.0. “On the 100th day celebration, we’re planning to gift our models to the2.0team,” says Daniel, adding that they have already received a huge order from Malaysia for the Rajinikanth statuette. The 3.0 models, in particular, are being sold at Rs. 2,000-3,000. iKix My3D models can be ordered online.

Ricky Kej, Grammy-winning musician|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|In this time and age, all of us are on the phones. The ambient sounds of our streets, the music in the clubs we frequent to relax are also very loud and not safe for the ears. As a musician, having an audience that can hear well and make out the nuances of different strands of music is very important. I would want a tech tool encoded in our phones, that allows us to measure the sounds we listen to on a daily basis and can issue warnings if we exceed the permissible limits. This is very important, since there is a good chance that people with hearing loss issues may not realise there is an issue that needs immediate attention. What’s out there? Using a noise-cancelling headphone might be helpful and may offer short-term solutions. Since a sound counter is not yet in the works, it would be a good idea to listen on earphones/headphones with the volume turned down, and moderate the use of these devices.|0|

It will help the industry a lot. What’s out there? Platforms such as apicbase.com have food management solutions on the cloud that can offer many solutions to these issues. To reduce food wastage, applications like Winnow can help. This UK-based startup uses a touchscreen tablet to identify what the kitchen staff put in the bin. An electronic scale records the weight and sends a message to the user, giving the cost of the food they’ve put in the bin. The meter is connected to cloud software which records and analyses the day’s waste. This gives owners and managers the information necessary to drive improvements in their system.|0|
Let the party begin!|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|Udyan Sagar, widely known as Nucleya, is considered to have brought a mini-revolution in the Indian electronic music scene. Known for his unique intermixing of genres while retaining an independent Indian identity, Nucleya is said to have put D back in EDM in the country. He has curated a fusion, now popular as “desi bass” among the masses. The bass producer is back with a full-length album project “Tota Myna” and has teamed up with Sunburn Festival to take it to different cities in India. Nucleya was in Delhi recently for The Riders Festival. Excerpts from a conversation: Tell us about your distinct style of music I think what’s unique is the fact that my kind of music is a really good combination of so many different Indian elements Also, I end up experimenting so much with dialogues and intros. I like folk music quite a lot. You would hear a lot of folk rhythms in my music. But everything is in the middle of electronic music. I think it’s a combination of all of these things which kind of makes it unique. Beside the choice of indigenous titles for your albums, how far do you think you’ve been successful in retaining a distinct cultural identity? I think I’ve been successful in the efforts I’ve made, though it was not intentional. It’s a good thing that people end up liking my music but if you see, I don’t really have a formula in place. If you listen to my music, my music has really long intros. Sometimes, the intros aren’t even music; they’re people delivering some dialogues or a sort of sound. They are more folk-inspired and if you compare that with mainstream music like western music or the sort of music which is played on the radio station, there the songs are very precise. They’re three or three-and-a-half minute long, you hear the chorus for the first thirty seconds.... My songs are just one-one-and-a-half minute long. There’s no formula in place; There’s no set format behind it. I’m happy it’s working out but I don’t know how it’s working out. The cultural element and flavour is definitely in place but I’m not consciously doing it. How difficult was it to set up the Bandish Projekt in 1998? It wasn’t difficult to make music; it was difficult to sell music because there was no infrastructure. The industry wasn’t like how it is today. There were no clubs and spaces for artists to perform. The record labels weren’t happy to support us because the music was so new and so different from the mainstream music. The awareness was not as much as it is today. That way it was very difficult, otherwise to be able to make music was very easy. In fact, it was easier for me then because I was very young and staying with my mom. I didn’t have to pay the rent, didn’t have to care about anything. I just had to get up and make music. You are often compared to international stars like DJ Snake and Skrillex who are also performing at the Sunburn Festival... I think people will do comparison because they love doing that. When you go to some of the sites online, it’s not about comparison – you become a commodity. But my life is very different from all those guys. They probably do a lot more shows in a year. I I don’t do as many shows now. Unlike me, a lot of them are not married. My life and my music revolve around my family. My lifestyle is very different from them. In terms of popularity, I am very popular in India and probably that’s why I’m being compared with those guys but musically, in terms of lifestyle and in terms of ambition, we’re very different. I think they’re extremely ambitious; I am just making music honestly. I am making music for myself, and it’s a very selfish reason. If I was in a state of mind where I wanted to be biggest in the world, I would have released albums way more frequently, would have travelled more, would do a lot many shows but I don’t do that because my intention of making music is to satisfy myself first. Can you elaborate on the choice of the titleTota Mynafor your latest album? When I was compiling the album, it turned out that a lot of songs were very emotional and it instantly took me back to my dating days when Smriti (Choudury) and I were dating and my mother used to call me and Smriti – Tota Myna because we used to be with each other and spend so much time together and it’s kind of similar to that space in terms of music. That’s why Smriti suggested that you should call this albumTota Myna. From judging “The Remix” to composing “Pentra” forMukkabaaz ,you moved towards a more mainstream space in 2018. Will it continue? I hope so. I think you will see me collaborating more. The thing is that I don’t plan these things. I am always excited about meeting like-minded people. Sometimes, I meet like-minded people in different industries, and then I end up working for the ones like Anurag Kashyap and Amazon Prime. It’s a thing where I’ve to be comfortable in what I’m getting into and if such projects come in my way, I’ll happily do them. What kind of songs and music would you suggest to play for the New Year, given the present trend? It’s interesting. For instance, I was talking to my mother on phone the other day and I asked what your plans are for the New Year’s and she said she is going to cook really nice food and listen to my music. I asked her what you would prefer to listen to on New Year’s and she said the sort of songs which calm her mind. The point is that everyone’s got their own taste in music. The idea is that you should enjoy yourself.|0|

Safdar Hashmi: a symbol for resistance|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|On the first day of 1989, theatremaker and cultural activist Safdar Hashmi was viciously attacked in a conflagration at a labour colony in the village of Jhandapur during a charged campaign rally. He succumbed to his injuries a day later. The ‘scuffle’, as it was facilely described in court, was not a targeted killing in the manner in which the recent assassinations of Lankesh, Dabholkar, Kalburgi or Pansare have been. Yet, for his cohorts and followers, this was nothing short of a martyrdom because the fundamental principles of egalitarianism and social justice that Hashmi uncompromisingly stood for were, and continue to be, under grievous threat. At the time of the incident, his troupe, the Jana Natya Manch (Janam), were performing the street play,Halla Bol, before being interrupted by a Congress-affiliated electoral convoy. The play was a reworking of an earlier production,Chakka Jam, and depicted the now-historic seven-day strike of the working classes that took place in Delhi and Ghaziabad just a couple of months earlier, and tempers against trade unionists were running high. On January 4, Janam returned to the spot and performed the play once again in a display of sombre resilience, watched by hundreds of freshly chastened but not subdued locals, many of whom were disenfranchised trade workers. Egalitarian agenda This year marks thirty years since Hashmi’s passing. It is an important signpost for all those who have joined forces with his agenda for change, irrespective of political affiliation. For Janam, it is business as usual, because every year since the incident, they have returned to Jhandapur and observed January 1 as the Safdar Hashmi Memorial Day. Performances, speeches, songs of resistance, are all part of an usual itinerary that begins around noon, with this year being no exception. Alongside Sahmat, the Safdar Hashmi Memorial Trust, Janam have played a significant role in keeping the legacy of their guiding light alive, forged in the spirit of the communist ideology and moral values that he died valiantly defending. Komita Dhanda, member of Janam, provides details of this year’s program, “The departure this year has been that this is the first time we are presenting a street performance on caste.” The play in question is Abhishek Majumdar’sTathagat. Appropriately, the bustling chauraha whereHalla Bolwas performed back in 1989 is now a park named after Dr B.R.Ambedkar. The other plays are a revival of Hashmi’sMachine, one of the most acclaimed plays in Janam’s repertoire, andGirgit, another Hashmi play that is being taken up for the first time by the group. It is now customary for all new Janam productions from the past year to be staged at Jhandapur in Uttar Pradesh. Caste and politics Majumdar’s play was specially commissioned to mark Hashmi’s thirtieth death anniversary. Janam’s Sudhanva Deshpande served as dramaturge on the project. Since the 2004 staging of the proscenium play,Shambookvadhon the question of caste, Deshpande had been keen to develop a street piece that touched upon similar issues.Tathagatis different from the usual Janam venture. “It doesn’t use day-to-day language, its scenography is also quite unique to the ethos it is trying to represent,” says Dhanda. It is set in a fictionalised Buddhist kingdom in ancient India, where a shudra sculptor has been sentenced to death for carving a statue of Buddha with three missing fingers. It is a 35-minute piece that examines the difference between a ‘traitorous’ and a ‘rebellious’ act, and finds particular resonance in these times when dissent is almost instantly regarded as treason. “It is the Dalits who have agency inTathagat,” observes Dhanda. Many viewers have pointed out parallels between the play and the contemporary political situation, with the narcissistic king at its centre coming across as a dead ringer for Narendra Modi. As it is with most Janam plays, the piece certainly wears its politics on its sleeve. Icon of change Safdar was only thirty-four years old when he died. The preceding decade had seen him come into his own as a cultural activist with a far-reaching influence. A ‘unity march’ he had organised in the capital in 1985 against the Anti-Sikh pogrom of 1984 brought together a large civilian populace across a spectrum, and is remembered by Janam old-timers as a show of strength that was particularly heartening. His life’s work served as a conduit between the artist and the worker. While his legacy has resisted the commodification of, say, Che Guevara — the face on a million T-shirts — there is still a recall for an incandescent persona that has become a symbol for resistance in a country shorn of true icons|0|

Technical throwbacks|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|2018 was a year that saw the rise and fall of cryptocurrencies, brought about conversations on the manner in which machine learning and artificial intelligence are going to change lives, and home automation emerged as a new buzzword in India. We take a look at some of the trends and gadgets that defined the year that has gone by in the tech sphere. Cryptocurrency When the year began, Bitcoin was the main topic of discussion, especially in the tech sphere. Everyone was reading up, listening to or talking about the complex world of blockchain and how it works, and many were invested in the idea of a universal currency not controlled by any government. Crypto was soon projected as the next big thing, that will change the way we perceive money. However, strict government control across the planet, security issues plaguing the security of the cryptocurrency meant that Bitcoin lost about 70% of its initial value over the year and the short-lived bubble went bust. In India, after the initial hoopla and outrage over cryptocurrency usage, the reaction to the drop in the value of Bitcoin has been rather muted. Indian drones fly out While elsewhere drones are being used for everything from delivering essential medicines and conducting agricultural surveys to delivering hamburgers from a nearby joint, in India, drone usage was banned. This blanket ban was finally lifted, albeit partially last month. Drone startups and companies are confident that these set of regulations and the upcoming ones will ensure that drone usage in India will take off in the right manner. Now, to check out some of the devices that impressed us the most this year. Apple iPad Pro After the initial excitement, when the iPad first launched and was seen as a replacement to conventional desktops, it slipped from the collective imagination soon afterwards. Though upgrades did come, they were rather incremental. All this made the New iPad Pro quite a big deal. It features a liquid retina display and is equipped with Apple’s A12X Bionic chip and gets the Face ID feature. The processing power is excellent and it can do all the things a regular laptop or desktop can, without breaking into much of a sweat. For the creatively inclined, the new and improved Apple pen will be an added benefit. Mi TV 4A The Mi TV 4A Full HD 49 is an excellent device, with a 49-inch IPS panel. It is a smart TV that runs Xiaomi’s PatchWall platform for content curation and discovery. The user interface is excellent, gets you to pick content from multiple streaming platforms and so on. The regular Google home screen is also available for those not very familiar with the PatchWall. Though the TV offers crisp visuals and a very good viewing experience, it does not support Netflix or Prime at the moment. This can be easily circumvented by getting an Amazon Fire TV Stick or the latest iteration of the Chromecast. Amazon Echo Dot I am not very sold on the idea of smart speakers or virtual assistants yet, especially given that the functionality of these devices seldom goes beyond playing music to show guests how it works, especially in India. However, the new rounded Echo Dot is a winner in its own. It is smart, catches the Indian accent well, and does not shy away from offering music suggestions. It is a good device to make shopping lists on, set alarms, get an Uber and play music. Once food streaming platforms and other home automation tools make their mark in India, the Echo will be in huge demand.|0|

Two killed, three injured in road accident in Dharwad|Hubballi|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|As residents of the twin cities welcomed the New Year with much fanfare by organising fun-filled programmes to mark Monday evening, two persons were killed after a New Year party in the early hours of Tuesday. The accident occurred near Itigatti Cross in Dharwad at around 3 a.m. between a car and truck killing one person on the spot. Another was killed on the way to hospital.

Modi rules out ordinance on Ram temple for now|New Delhi|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday made it clear that any decision on bringing an ordinance on the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya could be considered only after the judicial process got over. In an interview to ANI, Mr. Modi also suggested that the judicial process was being slowed down because Congress lawyers were creating “obstacles” in the Supreme Court. “We have said in our BJP manifesto that a solution would be found to this issue under the ambit of the Constitution,” he said, asked whether the Mandir issue had been sidelined. Recently, there has been a renewed pitch within the party as well as by its sister organisations in the Sangh Parivar for expediting the process of construction. The Sangh Parivar organisations are unhappy over the delay in resolving the matter and there are demands for an ordinance, similar to the one issued on triple talaq, to facilitate construction. The demand has been articulated even by the BJP’s ally, Shiv Sena. Asked whether the government could consider issuing an ordinance, the Prime Minister pointed out that the matter was before the Supreme Court and possibly in the final stages. “Let the judicial process be over. After it is over, whatever will be our responsibility as the government, we are ready to make all efforts,” he said. Hearing on January 4 The matter will be heard by the Supreme Court on January 4. Petitions have been filed in the court for day-to-day hearing. The Prime Minister was asked why the government could not take the ordinance route for the temple when a similar step was taken to ban triple talaq. Mr. Modi said, “The triple talaq ordinance was brought after the Supreme Court verdict, in the light of the Supreme Court verdict.” He was referring to the ruling in 2017, banning the practice among Muslims. Subsequently, the government issued an ordinance and brought a Bill in Parliament. The Bill has been passed by the Lok Sabha and now is before the Rajya Sabha. “Nobody can deny that those sitting in the governments in the last 70 years have tried their best to stall a solution to this [Ayodhya] issue,” Mr. Modi said. He said the Congress should “not create obstacles” and should let the judicial process take its own course. “Don’t weigh it in political terms,” he said. “I beseech the Congress, for the sake of national peace and amity, they should stop its lawyers from stalling this (Ayodhya issue) in the court,” he added. The Prime Minister said all lawyers, including the Congress ones, should head to the court and ensure that there is an early judicial verdict.|0|
A life dedicated to yoga|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|January 01, 2019 00:00 IST|I started my journey into yoga with medical problems: three slipped discs and immense pain, which had an effect on my body and mind. Soon, I got a home teacher, and in a year, we had reached a level where I could practise on my own. One day, while browsing in a bookstore I got my hands onYoga: A Gem for Women, by Geeta S. Iyengar, the youngest daughter of BKS Iyengar. That was the first time I read about a woman yoga teacher talking about the importance of yoga in a woman’s life, which is strange, because yoga is done mostly by women, with a predominance of male teachers! The book is a must-read for all women, as it covers the major stages of life and the changes the body goes through at every age. I began using the book to take me through my daily practice, and within a few months, I felt stronger, both in my mind and body. Though I have met Geetaji, as she is called by all, I never practised with her, but I have had the opportunity to study under her lifelong student Zarina Kolah. Through her, I got to know of Geetaji’s philosophy and teachings. Iyengar yoga uses simple props like a rolled towel, a brick, a chair, a rope, making yoga accessible to all, even to people who have physical disabilities. Geeta Iyengar showed us that the path of yoga requires dedication: she started teaching at the age of 15 and was dedicated to her father and his way of teaching. In fact, she died just a few days after the centenary celebrations of her father’s life. She chose to be asanyasin, carrying forward the work he had started.|0|
Man who attacked U.P. inspector arrested|LUCKNOW|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Uttar Pradesh police on Tuesday said they had arrested another person wanted in the murder of inspector Subodh Kumar Singh during the mob violence in Bulandshahr last month. The man, identified as Kalua alias Rajeev, is accused of wielding an axe on the police officer before he was shot dead with his service pistol, allegedly by another accused Prashant Natt. Kalua was nabbed at a bus station late on Monday. An axe, allegedly used in the crime, was recovered from him, a police officer said. “During questioning, it has come to light that he was the one who attacked inspector Subodh Kumar Singh with an axe, after which the incident [murderous attack on the officer] took place,” said SP (City) Atul Srivastava. The police said that after his arrest, Natt informed them that the inspector had first been hit with a sharp axe and assaulted with stones and sticks before he was shot. The mob also tried to burn the officer, the police said. Senior Superintendent of Police (Bulandshahr) Prabhakar Chaudhary said it was after Kalua attacked the officer with an axe on his head that the mob had set upon him.|0|
Scramble for alternatives to plastics begins|CHENNAI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Day one of the ban on single-use plastics in the State on Tuesday witnessed the hiking of prices of alternatives such as cloth bags and banana leaves, sale of non-woven bags as permissible, many hotels and shops switching to alternatives and plastic manufacturers and sellers shutting shop, protesting seizure of all kinds of plastics in Kancheepuram, Salem, Villupuram, Paramakudi, Madurai and Vellore. In Chennai, a plastics wholesaler who had shut shop claimed that in many places local body workers had been bringing back seized goods over the past month and selling it back to them. The prices of banana leaves shot up from Rs. 2 to Rs. 15 a piece and that of cloth bags from Rs. 3 to Rs. 50 each, said a seller. ‘Clarity needed’ A plastics manufacturer said that there was still a lot of confusion as to what was banned and that even officials on raids were not sure of what is what. “My plastic sheet is used as packaging material by industries and also by small eateries to be used on plates. I cannot determine the end use. I need clarity,” he said. The ban saw a mixed response in Coimbatore, Tiruchi and Madurai. In Coimbatore, most restaurants and retailers had switched over to alternatives. Interestingly, poultry meat stall owners were offering Rs. 5 rebate or free eggs for people who come with vessels to carry home the poultry meat. A few Tasmac outlets had replaced plastic cups with glass tumblers. In the Nilgiris, officials inspected the Udhagamandalam and Coonoor markets to ensure that non-woven bags were not being used by vendors, shop owners and restaurants to package food. Products seized The district administration had seized more than 75 kg of banned plastic products from store owners and levied fines of Rs. 1.64 lakh on business owners continuing to flout rules. In Erode, most large commercial establishments, including textile showrooms and restaurants, displayed messages about the ban and asked customers to bring their own bags. However, smaller establishments continued to use the banned items as they said that alternative products were not available or were costly. “They should have supplied us with alternatives before the ban began,” said a fruit seller. In Madurai, many shopkeepers and hoteliers continued the practice of using non-woven bags on the first day of the implementation of the plastics ban on Monday. S. Pandi, a fruit seller in Goripalayam, said that most people were still unaware that non-woven bags cannot be used. “I bought them in bulk and have no choice but to use them until I exhaust stock. The officials from the Corporation and district administration should have created more awareness,” he said. Many hotels began displaying signs asking customers to bring their own tiffin carriers and bags for take-aways. “In case the customers do not bring their own bags, we package the food in banana leaves. We are yet to find viable and cheap alternatives to pack sambar and chutney,” said K. Kannan, owner of a small-scale restaurant. ‘Strong awareness’ Many shoppers in Tiruchi were seen carrying cloth bags to buy vegetables and grocery items. Several grocery shops had put up notices asking customers to bring cloth bags. “We notice strong awareness among the customers on plastic ban. Most of them brought cloth bags to buy commodities on the first day of the ban,” said M. Manikandan, a grocery trader at Cantonment in Tiruchi. In Kancheepuram, the district administration plans to step up the on-going awareness campaigns to highlight the impact of the non-recyclable and non-degradable plastic products on the environment. “This is so that the consumer is better informed and can help bring about the change,” said an official. In Tiruvannamalai, Collector K.S. Kandasamy inaugurated a permanent shop for alternatives to banned plastic items on Tuesday. An initiative of the Tiruvannamalai Municipality, the sale counter/shop at Asaliamman Koil Street sold alternatives to banned plastics, said S. Parijatham, Commissioner of the municipality.

Three students drown in the Netravathi in Uppinangady|MANGALURU|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Three pre-university students from a government college in Uppinangady were drowned in the Netravathi river near here on Monday. The three bodies were found in the early hours of Tuesday. According to Uppinangady police, Farzan hosted a party for his two friends, Mohammed Shaheer and Mohammed Suhail on account of his birthday. He cut a cake in a corner of the college and it was shared among them. They ate that and a few other snacks and went away to the river nearby to wash their hands and faces. The three, however, did not return to their houses and their family members launched a search. During the search, a man told the family members about the three going towards the river. The family members and the police found the bag and the uniforms of the students on the shore. Fire and Emergency Services personnel and local swimmers later launched a search in the river course. At around 5 a.m. on Tuesday, the bodies were retrieved from the river. The Uppinangady police have registered a case of unnatural death.

Naidu hints at broad political alliance in State|VIJAYAWADA|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu on Tuesday dropped enough hints on the possible broad realignment of political parties in the State in the run-up to the general elections in 2019. Though he did not categorically say the TDP and the Jana Sena Party (JSP) would join hands, he sought to know what the stand of YSR Congress president Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on an alliance with the BJP was. “Why is he [Mr. Jagan] bothered about the TDP-JSP alliance. I don’t want to comment in this regard right now. Let him say whether he would sail with the BJP or not,” he told a press conference. He also parried a question why the TDP was soft-pedalling with JSP chief Pawan Kalyan of late. Instead, he recalled that he suggested to Mr. Pawan to fight against the Centre for the injustice to Andhra Pradesh. When asked if the JSP was willing to join hands with the TDP, Mr. Naidu said: “I will not answer speculative questions.” Mr. Pawan, who campaigned for the TDP-BJP combine in the 2014 elections, had been critical of the State government in the recent past. Reacting to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s comment that the grand alliance had failed, the TDP national president said there was no truth in their claims.

BSP chief’s demand natural: Gehlot|Jaipur|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|A day after Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati’s threat to reconsider support to the newly-elected Congress regime, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Tuesday said his government would examine the cases registered against Dalits who had participated in the Bharat Bandh organised on April 2 last year over the alleged dilution of the SC/ST Act. “The cases were lodged against Dalit protesters... How many of them were actually guilty is a matter of investigation,” Mr. Gehlot told reporters at the State Congress headquarters here. He said those who were innocent were also booked sometimes, and added that no innocent person should be framed in a criminal case.|0|

DMK senior leaders urge Stalin to contest in Tiruvarur bypoll|CHENNAI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|DMK president M.K. Stalin is facing a piquant situation, as many senior party leaders are urging him to enter the fray in Tiruvarur, where a byelection is scheduled for January 28. Tiruvarur was last represented by his father and DMK leader M Karunanidhi, who won by a margin of over 68,000 votes. Sources said that though Mr. Stalin had not made up his mind, he was unlikely to accept their proposal, as he was representing the Kolathur Assembly constituency. “What is preventing him from taking a final decision is that he is not interested in causing a byelection to yet another constituency [Kolathur],” a party source said. The DMK leaders met him on Tuesday morning and had another round of meeting with him at his Alwarpet bungalow in the evening. A senior leader said though no decision was taken, they would meet Mr. Stalin again on Wednesday to place their request that he should enter the fray from Tiruvarur. Senior leaders, including party treasurer Duraimurugan, headquarters secretary T.R. Baalu and women’s wing leader Kanimozhi were closeted with Mr. Stalin for over an hour. Mr. Duraimurugan, when contacted, said, “There is a party general council and other relevant bodies that would take a decision on who would be fielded in Tiruvarur.”|0|
India, Pak. move towards release of civilian prisoners|NEW DELHI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|In a peace overture, India has asked Islamabad to take back dozens of Pakistani nationals who have completed jail terms here. The Indian request came in the context of the exchange of the lists of prisoners in both countries that took place on the first day of the new year. “India has also asked Pakistan to expedite response in the cases of 80 Pakistan prisoners who have completed their sentences and await repatriation for want of nationality confirmation by Pakistan,” the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said in a statement after India handed over a list of 249 civilian Pakistani prisoners and 98 fishermen in its custody. In turn, Pakistan shared lists of 54 civilian prisoners and 483 fishermen in Pakistani jails, who it claims are Indian. Formalities completed Out of the total number of Indian prisoners in Pakistan, Delhi has asked Islamabad to release 17 Indian civilian prisoners and 369 Indian fishermen whose nationality has been confirmed. The MEA said India has shared details of the reconstituted Joint Judicial Committee and of the medical professionals who are expected to visit Pakistan to help the elderly and mentally unsound Indian prisoners in Pakistani custody. Activists hail move Activists have welcomed the bilateral move, saying this will help long suffering prisoners in each other’s custody. Peace activist Jatin Desai of Pakistan-India Peoples’s Forum for Peace and Democracy (PIPFPD reiterated that both countries in fact claim that the exact number of prisoners in each other’s custody is “a bit higher” than the official numbers shared. Mr. Desai also said the cases of prisoners who have served jail terms should be taken up at the earliest. “The process of nationality confirmation should be completed before the completion of the jail term and the persons should be immediately released as the jail term ends,” Mr. Desai said, urging both countries to grant consular access to prisoners. The exchange of lists comes despite continued military tension, which has, however, not dampened humanitarian moves by both sides. In December 2018, Pakistan sent back Indian prisoner Hamid Nehal Ansari who had completed both regular and irregular prison terms. India subsequently released Pakistani Imran Warsi, who was awaiting repatriation after serving a jail term.|0|
Senior DMK leaders urge Stalin to contest in Tiruvarur|CHENNAI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|DMK president M.K. Stalin is facing a piquant situation as many senior party leaders are urging him to enter the fray in the Tiruvarur where a bypoll is due on January 28.

Praveen Kumar takes oath as HC acting CJ|VIJAYAWADA|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|A new chapter had begun in the history of sunrise State Andhra Pradesh with the inauguration of the temporary campus for the High Court at the CM’s camp office here on Tuesday. Justice Chagari Praveen Kumar, senior-most Judge of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh, took charge as acting Chief Justice. The court had been established consequent to the bifurcation of the High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad. Supreme Court Judge N.V. Ramana inaugurated the High Court in the presence of Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu and others. Justice Ramana said the High Court had been established after a long time in Vijayawada. The problems of the petitioners would come down with the move. More than the establishment of the High Court, it was necessary to protect the values of it. Mr. Naidu said the bifurcation was almost complete with the division of the High Court in physical sense. Except division of the funds and assets, the entire Capital had been shifted to AP. Justice Praveen Kumar said the State had witnessed a historical event with the inauguration and a new history had begun in the State. “It is my duty to strive for welfare of all sections of society. I shall work under guidance of Supreme Court judges.”|0|

The Pune Rural Police and the district administration pulled out all the stops to ensure that the event passed off without any incident.

Where January 1 is always ‘Good News Day’|GUWAHATI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Guwahati woke up on the first morning of 2019 to a piece of news that Saurav Kumar Chaliha would have approved of: though traffic police had detected 417 cases of drunken driving the previous night, they were more impressed by the many citizens who “used sober drivers to make the celebrations safe”. It was a candidate for ‘Good News Day’, observed by Chaliha’s fan club on Tuesday. Chaliha, or SKC, one of Assam’s most popular short story writers, led a dual life. Till he breathed his last on June 25, 2011, very few knew that his real name was Surendra Nath Medhi, a Physics faculty at the Assam Engineering College. SKC was so publicity-shy that he did not receive the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1974. The Akademi later had the award sent to him. But his fan club has dedicated the first day of the year to his memory, celebrating it as ‘Good News Day’. The SKC fan club has 21 executive committee members and hundreds of members across Assam and beyond. Zebin Ahmed, a librarian at the century-old Cotton University in Guwahati, is its president. Began with essay “We began celebrating January 1 as Bhaal Khabaror Din (Good News Day) in 2010 to mark one of his feel-good essays in an Assamese daily published on January 1, 1998. In that piece, he had underlined the importance of starting the New Year with positive news,” said Mahesh Deka, secretary of Saurav Kumar Chaliha Anuragi Samaj (SKC fan club). SKC’s write-up may have been intended to promote one of his most popular stories, ‘Bhal Khabar’, published that year. But the idea stirred his fans enough to plan a meeting on New Year’s Day every year. Mr. Deka said that had SKC been alive, he would have liked the traffic story, where the focus was more on the citizen’s concern for road safety than on the number of people booked for drunk driving. Ritually, the fan club members scan newspapers and television channels for inspiring news on January 1, avoiding, as SKC desired, the coverage on accidents, murders, violence, rapes, or corruption. On Tuesday, fan club members read out a couple of his stories and discussed the narrative and characters of a couple more. Actor Papori Medhi enacted a monologue based on his story ‘Gharua Ghatana’ (Domestic Incident). Aauthor Arup Kumar Dutta said that SKC was a rare writer who enjoyed the kind of fan following typically associated with film, music and sports stars.|0|
As election year dawns, Modi gives a report card|New Delhi|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Two days after the Army foiled a fresh attempt by Pakistan’s Border Action Team (BAT) to push infiltrators through the Line of Control in Kashmir, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday that India would make all efforts to keep up the pressure on Pakistan, but it would be a huge mistake to believe that the country would mend its ways anytime soon. Mr. Modi said, whether through surgical strikes or action at other levels, the Indian government was working out various strategies to force Pakistan to check terrorism. He said that while India favoured a dialogue and good friendly relations with its neighbour, it was also wary of the fact that Pakistan was not going to stop promoting cross-border terrorism soon. Asked why cross-border attacks had not stopped despite the surgical strikes, he said, “Whatever strategy is to be adopted, how to do it, is ongoing at appropriate levels, has been happening...It will be a huge mistake to believe that Pakistan will mend its ways after a war. It will take a lot of time for Pakistan to mend its ways.” “India, whether under UPA or NDA government, has never opposed dialogue. It is our consistent policy that we are in favour of dialogue. It is the consistent policy of the country, not Modi government or Manmohan Singh government,” he said.  On his government’s China policy, he said India should be judged on the basis of what it did in Doklam. He said nothing had happened with India since then that could be considered deceit. Responding to the criticism of his foreign tours as being too many and offering more photo opportunities rather than yielding anything substantial, Mr. Modi said his travel schedule had been more or less similar to that of his predecessors but his visits were noticed more because he interacted with people, took decisions and made India’s voice heard. “Come back before sunrise, irrespective of the success or failure of the mission.” This was the Prime Minister’s message to the Army commandos who went across the LoC on September 28, 2016 to carry out surgical strikes. He said the date of the attack was changed twice, keeping in mind the safety and security of the troops.|0|

Western outfits barred in Durga temple premises|VIJAYAWADA|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Following the footsteps of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams, the Governing Board of the Kanaka Durga temple atop the Indrakeeladri has imposed strict dress code for devotees from Tuesday (January 1). Executive Officer Koteswaramma said the move was aimed at preserving the culture and tradition of the Hindu religion. “It is the responsibility of every individual to safeguard the Hindu traditions,” she told media. Members of the Indian women’s cricket team visited the temple recently in western wear and sparked a controversy. Ms. Koteswaramma said for those unaware of the rule, a special counter selling ‘Amma’ saris at a nominal price of Rs. 100 had been made available. “All they need to do is drape the sari over their clothes and go for darshan.” The authorities also arranged a changing room adjacent to the sari counter. Women are allowed to wear saris and Punjabi suits while men have to wear only pant-shirt, kurta-pyjama, lungi or a traditional dhoti/panchey/angavastra. Jeans, short skirts, trousers or bermudas are a big ‘no-no’.|0|

Full of ‘I’s and lies: Congress|NEW DELHI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Congress on Tuesday described Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s interview to news agency, ANI, as that of a ‘defeatist’ Prime Minister that was was full of rhetoric and didn’t mention the promises made by him to the people before the 2014 election. Congress communication chief Randeep Surjewala said the Prime Minister should have spoken about the suffering caused by demonetisation, GST, bank frauds, failure to get back black money, fragile security situation and farmers’ woes. “Summary of Modiji’s ‘monologue’ interview — ‘I’, ‘Me’, ‘Mine’, ‘Myself’. The country is suffering your ‘I’s and ‘lies’,” Mr. Surjewala said at a press conference. “The Prime Minister is so helpless that he can’t even answer from where he is going to contest the next Parliamentary election or whether he will contest at all. This shows a defeatist Prime Minister,” he added. ‘Fixed interview’ Congress Deputy Leader in the Rajya Sabha, Anand Sharma, said the people of the country cannot be ‘fooled’ through a ‘fixed interview’ and dared him to face Parliament and hold a press conference. “PM Modi did not spare our people of his penchant for false promises, hollow claims and propaganda even on the New Year day. The habitual peddler of untruths and lies has signalled a nasty narrative for the 2019 election campaign,” Mr. Sharma said in a series of tweets. “People cannot be fooled through a fixed interview. Have the courage to face us in Parliament or address a press conference. Having betrayed the people, do not beg Lord Ram to save you. He did not ask you to lie in the first place,” Mr. Sharma tweeted.|0|
Separatists to counter IS supporters|Srinagar|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Separatists under the umbrella Joint Resistance Leadership (JRL) plan to confront Islamic State (IS) supporters on Friday by holding a protest against the unfurling of an IS flag at the pulpit of the Jamia Masjid here last week. All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, the Valley’s head priest whose family traditionally delivers a sermon from the pulpit every Friday, on Monday registered a protest against the move “to usurp” the politically significant pulpit. He met JRL leaders Syed Ali Geelani and Yasin Malik to rally their support against the act. During the meeting of the Awami Action Committee, chaired by the Mirwaiz, the attempt by the alleged IS supporters was termed as a “violation of the pulpit by a bunch of goons”. The Mirwaiz, sources said, described the act as “a ploy” against the entire separatist leadership. He is reported to have asserted at the meeting that the pulpit represented the religious identity, social and political aspirations of the people of Kashmir for the past many decades and that it would continue to do so, no matter how many conspiracies were hatched by “miscreants backed by security agencies”. Joint protest The Mirwaiz, who will chair another meeting on Wednesday, called for a joint protest on January 4, and described the coming Friday asYoum-e-Taqadus(Day of Consecration). Supporting the Mirwaiz, Hurriyat faction chairman Mr. Geelani and JKLF chief Mr. Malik said, “These mischievous actions cannot be tolerated and people should be cautious and conscious about such disrespectful events.” All three plan to offer prayers together. The Jamaat-e-Islami and traders’ bodies, including the Kashmir Economic Alliance (KEA), condemned the masked men’s bid to unfurl the IS flag at the pulpit. “The mosque is our pride,” said KEA chairman Yasin Khan. “The desecration wouldn’t be tolerated. There’s a need to come up with a collective strategy to foil such nefarious designs,” he added. According to the police, it had killed at least 10 IS recruits, who switched sides from the Hizbul Mujahideen or the Tehreek-ul-Mujahideen in 2018. “The IS ranks are negligible and its limited influence was confined to urban pockets, especially Srinagar and Pulwama,” said a senior police officer, speaking on condition of anonymity. “It did influence educated and Internet-hooked youth like Esa Fazili through online literature and videos,” he added.|1|January 4
Ganga water quality has improved, govt. tells RS|NEW DELHI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The water quality of the Ganga in 2018 has “improved over last year”, according to a written statement in the Rajya Sabha on Monday by junior Water Resources Minister Satyapal Singh. The statement said “dissolved oxygen” levels had improved at 39 locations, and “biological oxygen demand” (BOD) levels and faecal coliform had decreased at 42 and 47 locations respectively. These three parameters are a proxy for both the presence of aquatic life as well as microbes that may be harmful to these biota, and are conventionally used to assess the quality of the river. Improved stretches These improved stretches of the river included places such as Rishikesh, the Har-Ki-Pauri Ghat at Haridwar; Ranighat in Kanpur; Tarighat in Ghazipur; Narora in Bulandshahr; Kachhla Ghat in Badaun, Aligarh; Buxar, Mokama and Munger — all in Bihar; Uluberia, Dakshineshwar and Diamond Harbour in West Bengal. Sewage treatment plants The government said Rs. 5,100 crore, of the Rs. 20,000 crore allotted to clean the Ganga, had been spent under the Namami Gange Programme from 2014-15 to 2018-19. Last year, Rs. 1,725.86 crore had been spent till December 26, taking the cumulative expenditure to Rs. 5,187.37 crore. More than half the funds had been directed towards making new sewage treatment plants (STP) and effluent treatment plants (ETP), as well as making sub-par plants work better. From April 2014 to March 2018, a total of 145 projects were sanctioned at an estimated cost of Rs. 15,074.76 crore. However, independent experts have said the cleaning efforts were half-hearted and there was little effort to ensure that the river’s voluminous flow in the upper stretches of Uttarakhand is maintained downstream.|0|

‘BSP chief’s demand is natural’|Jaipur|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|A day after Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati’s threat to reconsider support to the newly-elected Congress regime, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Tuesday said his government would examine the cases registered against Dalits who had participated in the Bharat Bandh organised on April 2 last year over the alleged dilution of the SC/ST Act. “The cases were lodged against Dalit protesters... How many of them were actually guilty is a matter of investigation,” Mr. Gehlot told reporters at the State Congress headquarters here. He said those who were innocent were also booked sometimes, and added that no innocent person should be framed in a criminal case. In an indication of the seriousness with which the Congress has treated Ms. Mayawati’s warning to the Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh governments, Mr. Gehlot said the BSP chief's demand was “natural”. “She may be right in her perspective... The [State] government will look into it and examine the cases,” he said.  Mr. Gehlot expressed gratitude to Ms. Mayawati for extending outside support to his government. “I appreciate and thank Ms. Mayawati for giving the BSP’s support without the Congress formally asking for it,” he said. In Rajasthan, the Congress won 99 of the 199 seats for which elections were held, falling just short of a majority in the 200-seat House. The BSP then offered outside support of its six MLAs. Ms. Mayawati had warned that the BSP would reconsider its support to the Congress governments in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh if they did not act swiftly and withdrew the cases registered against “innocent people” in connection with Bharat Bandh. Violent incidents took place in several towns of the State during the bandh and one person died in Alwar.|0|
Bhima-Koregaon stays peaceful|PUNE|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The 201st anniversary of the Bhima-Koregaon battle passed off without any incident as lakhs of Ambedkarites from across Maharashtra and India congregated near the commemorative Bhima-Koregaon ‘Ranstambh’ (victory pillar) on Tuesday under heavy security cover. The Pune Rural Police and the district administration pulled out all the stops to ensure that the event passed off without any incident. Officials estimated 8 to 10 lakh visitors this year — perhaps the largest since the Bhima-Koregaon Ranstambh Seva Sangh, which organises the ceremony, was formed in 2005 to keep alive the memory of this episode. ‘Absurd narrative’ Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh chief Prakash Ambedkar, grandson of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, was among the first Dalit leaders to lay a wreath near the obelisk at Perne. Speaking to reporters, Mr. Ambedkar said the ‘Elgaar Parishad’ of December 31 last year was an attempt to bridge the rift between various communities. “Instead, the investigation conducted by the Pune city police turned the objective of the Elgaar conclave upside down. The State government targeted the men and women like retired judges B.G. Kolse-Patil, P.B. Sawant and Harshali Potdar, who were behind organising the conference, weaving an absurd narrative of ‘urban naxalism’,” he said. Internet services were suspended to prevent the spread of inflammatory messages. Drones and CCTV cameras were in place near the tombs of the Maratha King Sambhaji and that of Govind Ganpat Mahar in Vadhu Budruk village — the major flashpoints of violence last year.|0|
India, Pak. move ahead on prisoners’ release|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Activists have welcomed the bilateral move, saying this will help long suffering prisoners in each other’s custody. Peace activist Jatin Desai of Pakistan-India Peoples’s Forum for Peace and Democracy reiterated that both countries in fact claim that the exact number of prisoners in each other’s custody is “a bit higher” than the official numbers shared. Mr. Desai said the cases of prisoners who have served jail terms should be taken up at the earliest. “The process of nationality confirmation should be completed before the completion of the jail term and the persons should be immediately released as the jail term ends,” Mr. Desai said, urging both countries to grant consular access to prisoners. The exchange of lists comes despite continued military tension, which has, however, not dampened humanitarian moves by both sides. In December 2018, Pakistan sent back Indian prisoner Hamid Nehal Ansari who had completed both regular and irregular prison terms.

Contentious January awaits CJI Gogoi|NEW DELHI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|All eyes will be on Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi at the head of the Supreme Court Bench which is scheduled to hear a series of politically sensitive cases, including the Ramjanma- bhoomi-Babri Masjid title dispute appeals on January 4, and a flood of review petitions in the Sabarimala temple case. In the Ayodhya matter, the CJI-led Bench would fix the date for hearing the appeals. It is to be seen whether the court would fix a date after the Lok Sabha election or earlier. The case is considered a political hot potato with many Hindutva leaders urging an early hearing and decision from the court. Sabarimala issue The Sabarimala review petitions, meanwhile, go to the very core of the majority judgment delivered by a Constitution Bench, striking down a law which banned women of menstrual age from entering or praying at the famed hill temple in Kerala. The petitions have challenged the authority of the Supreme Court to “reform” a religious practice out of existence on the basis of PIL petitions filed by third parties who are not co-religionists. In an exceptional move, a five-judge Review Bench is set to hear the petitioners in open court. In another significant case, scheduled for hearing on January 9, former Supreme Court judge, Justice H.S. Bedi, is expected to file his response to an objection raised by the Gujarat government that he had “unilaterally” prepared the final report on 21 police encounters which occurred in the State between 2003 and 2006 when Mr. Narendra Modi was Chief Minister. The State government had submitted before a Bench led by Chief Justice Gogoi that Justice Bedi did not share the views of the other members of the apex court-appointed monitoring authority before submitting the final and 11th report on the police encounters in the Supreme Court on January 26, 2018. Rumblings in CBI The Bench led by Chief Justice Gogoi is also expected to pronounce its decision in a petition filed by exiled CBI Director Alok Verma, who has challenged his “overnight” divestment from the top post at the country’s premier investigative agency. Mr. Verma has alleged political interference in the functioning of the CBI. Meanwhile, the government may seek an early hearing of its eight-page “correction” application in which it has blamed the Supreme Court for “misinterpreting” the English tenses in its December 14 judgment which said that the CAG has prepared a report on the 36 Rafale jets’ deal, which has already been examined by the Parliamentary Accounts Committee. Activists’ murders The first week of January would also see the CBI come back to the Supreme Court Bench, led by Justice U.U. Lalit, with its response to the court’s suggestion to have a single investigative agency probe the murders of journalist Gauri Lankesh, activists Narendra Dabholkar and Govind Pansare and littérateur M.M. Kalburgi. The court had flagged the possibility of a “common thread” running through the four killings, which which had sent shock waves across the nation and were considered in some quarters as part of a concerted effort to silence dissenting voices. The first month of the year may also see the Supreme Court Bench, led by Justice N.V. Ramana, begin its hearing of appeals filed by the CBI and accused persons in the SNC Lavalin corruption case. The CBI has contended that Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan should face trial in the corruption case.|0|
Swelling crowds force Delhi Metro to shut exit gates|New Delhi|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Following heavy footfall in the Central Delhi area on Tuesday owing to New Year celebrations, the Delhi police issued an advisory leading to the closure of exit gates of four major metro stations. Police and metro officials said the gates were closed as a crowd control measure. “As per instructions from the Delhi police, exits at Central Secretariat, Udyog Bhawan, Mandi House and Pragati Maidan metro stations were blocked with immediate effect, around afternoon due to a swelling crowd. The gates were opened around 7.28 p.m.,” said a Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) official. Deputy Commissioner of Police (New Delhi) Madhur Verma said, “Last year, Delhi was gridlocked for several hours on January 1.  Past lessons The pattern from last year was studied and it was already decided that exit points of these metro station will be closed for a few hours to control the crowd,” he said, referring to a meeting between local police, traffic police and metro police before the New Year’s Eve. Unable to enter the metro stations closest to India Gate or the National Zoological Park, both of which saw a high footfall, passengers were forced to walk to several other metro stations. “We had come to India Gate in the afternoon and since 5 p.m. we have been trying to head home. It’s been two hours already and not only did we not find a single cab, the Central Secretariat metro station was shut for entry to the station. We have been walking since then and are now headed to ITO metro station, where hopefully we will be able to board the metro,” said Suraj, a government employee headed towards GTB Nagar. For Seema Rawat, the day-out with her friends and five children turned out to be a trying one after the group of eight failed to avail any public transport for over two hours.|0|
‘Urjit was not made to leave’|New Delhi|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|“I am revealing for the first time. He [RBI Governor Urjit Patel] was telling me about it for the past six or seven months before his resignation. He gave it even in writing. He wrote to me personally,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said. Stressing that institutions such as the CBI and the judiciary were paramount to his government, the Prime Minister said the Congress had no right to criticise the Centre on this score. “The Congress has no right to speak on this issue. Against the PM and PMO, the NAC [National Advisory Council] was formed. What kind of empowerment of the PMO was this? Cabinet takes such a big decision and a big leader tears [into] that Cabinet decision at a press conference. What kind of respect is [this] for an institution,” he said. Changes in CBI “When the CBI’s internal personal matter came to light, they [CBI Director Alok Verma and his deputy Rakesh Asthana] were both asked to go on leave legally. Because the institution is paramount for us,” the PM said. “Recently, the Sohrabuddin judgment came. Just read that judgment. See how institutions were misused. The accusation on us is that Modi is not taking action against these people. And you are saying this is vendetta. ED is doing its job professionally. From a foreign country, arazdaar[confidant] has been brought into custody of India. Should not every Indian be proud of it,” said the Prime Minister, referring to Christian Michel, the alleged middleman in the Rs. 3,600-crore AgustaWestland VVIP chopper deal.|0|

Final NRC to offer Aadhaar benefit|New Delhi|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) will record biometric data including the fingerprints and iris scans of about 30 lakh applicants who have sought to be included in the National Register of Citizens (NRC) after having been excluded from the final draft published last year. Almost 30 lakh out of the 40 lakh people who found their names missing had filed claims to be included during the claims and objections round that ended on December 31. A senior government official said the UIDAI would obtain the biometrics when the applicants appeared for hearings to be held by Class-I officers starting from February 15. By the standard operating procedure (SOP) submitted by the Centre in the Supreme Court, “during the course of the hearings, the State government in collaboration with UIDAI will undertake the process of biometric enrolment of all the applicants of NRC. The biometric enrolment in respect of persons who are part of claims and those persons objected upon will be distinctive and separate ID will be generated.” No claims by 10 lakh The fate of the 10 lakh applicants who had not filed claims was yet to be decided, the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said. “This means that they do not have documents to prove that they came to India before March 1971, the cut-off date to be included in the NRC,” said the official, adding that the 10 lakh people had been identified and that their details were available with the authorities. “Once the claims have been heard and the final NRC has been decided, only the eligible applicants will be given the Aadhaar card. The authorities will have the biometrics of all the applicants,” said the official.|0|
10-year-old killed in Delhi in celebratory firing|New Delhi|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|A 10-year-old boy died when a bullet hit him during celebratory firing in north-east Delhi’s New Usmanpur on New Year’s Eve, the police said on Tuesday. They are yet to make any arrests in the case. Rihan Malik, a Class III student of a private school, was attending a birthday party-cum-New Year celebrations when the incident happened. However, the family did not see who fired the gun, the police said. Rihan’s 45-year-old father Yasin Malik, who owns a meat shop in Usmanpur, said the boy was invited to a neighbour’s birthday party on Monday evening. Around 40 children “The neighbours had a DJ and about 40 children aged between 10 and 20 years were present for the celebration along with the host family,” Mr. Malik said. The victim who was at the party since 8 p.m., was dancing with his friends. They were gearing up for the New Year but around 10.30 p.m., a gunshot was heard, he said. Shot in the face “I was standing at the door and looking at the celebration from a distance. I heard the gunshot when someone said the bullet hit my son in the face. I ran towards him and saw him bleeding profusely. I held him but he was unconscious,” the father said. The locals rushed the boy to Jag Pravesh Chandra Hospital, where he was declared brought dead. The family said they suspect that a few people, who were not residents of the colony, had entered the celebration carrying a weapon and committed the crime. “There are a few videos taken by those present at the function, which have been taken by police,” said the boy’s uncle Mustafa Ahmad (38), who runs a restaurant in the area. Deputy Commissioner of Police (North-East) Atul Kumar Thakur said a case under Section 302 (punishment for murder) has been registered and three suspects are being questioned. “The prime accused has been identified after questioning those present at the spot and with the help of video footage that was available,” he said. In another incident, a 13-year-old boy sustained injuries on his shoulder after a bullet hit him during celebratory firing in north-east Delhi’s Welcome, the police said on Tuesday.  One accused held Sohil, a Class IX student of a government school, is undergoing treatment at Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital. Accused Sakib (23), a resident of Welcome, has been arrested in the case. His maternal grandmother Munni Begum said the boy along with a few others was celebrating on her house’s terrace when the bullet hit him around midnight. No gunshots heard “We did not see who fired the bullet. In fact, we could not even hear the gunshot because people were bursting firecrackers,” she said. The boy was rushed to Jag Pravesh Chandra Hospital from where he was referred to GTB Hospital. “He was present with the boy during celebration but later fled the spot,” the officer said.  I was standing at the door and looking at the celebration from a distance. I heard the gunshot and someone said the bullet hit my son in the face. I ran towards him and he was bleeding profusely.

‘Triple talaq an issue of gender equality’|New Delhi|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said that while triple talaq was a matter of gender equality, entry of women in Sabarimala was related to tradition. The Prime Minister said the ordinance against triple talaq was brought keeping in mind gender equality and social justice and it should not be seen as interference in religious issues. However, on the entry of women of menstrual age in the Sabarimala temple and protests by Hindu groups, he said the issue related to tradition. “Most Islamic countries have banned triple talaq. So it is not a matter of religion or faith. Even in Pakistan, triple talaq is banned. So it is an issue of gender equality, a matter of social justice. It is not an issue of faith. So keep the two separate,” he said. “There are some temples, which have their own traditions, where men can’t go. And men don’t go... In this, Sabrimala [issue], a woman judge in the Supreme Court has made certain observations. There is no need to attribute those to any political party. As a woman, she has made some suggestions. There should be a debate on that as well sometimes,” the Prime Minister said.|0|

Man who attacked U.P. inspector arrested|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Uttar Pradesh police on Tuesday said it had arrested another person accused in the murder of officer Subodh Kumar Singh last month during mob violence in Bulandshahr. The man, identified as Kalua alias Rajeev, is accused of wielding an axe on the police officer before he was shot dead with his service pistol, allegedly by another accused Prashant Natt. Kalua was nabbed from a bus station late on Monday. An axe, allegedly used in the crime, was also recovered from him, said a senior police official. “During questioning, it has come to light that he was the one who attacked inspector Subodh Kumar Singh with an axe, after which the incident [murderous attack on the officer] took place,” said SP (City) Atul Srivastava. The police said that after his arrest, Natt had informed them that the inspector had first been hit with a sharp axe and assaulted with stones and sticks before he was shot. The mob also tried to burn the officer, police said. Mr. Srivastava said that Kalua attacked the officer when he was trying to prevent the accused from cutting a tree with his axe to create a blockade on the road. While the police are still looking for others accused in the murder case, some of the main accused in instigating the violence, Bajrang Dal activist Yogesh Raj and the BJP youth wing’s Shikhar Agarwal, are still absconding. 30 arrested so far About 30 persons have been arrested so far. The police had named 27 persons in the FIR, while more than 70 were unnamed. “There is regular progress in the case,” said Mr. Srivastava. Mr. Singh was shot dead when a mob went on a rampage in Bulandshahr’s Syana area on December 3 after right-wing groups alleged that some cows had been slaughtered, and brought carcasses to the police outpost in a tractor trolley. He was shot near his left eyebrow by a .32 bore weapon, the police had earlier said on the basis of the autopsy report. Mr. Singh had overseen the investigation into the lynching of Mohammad Akhlaq in Dadri as the investigating officer probing the case.|0|

Water being pumped out of Meghalaya mine|GUWAHATI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Rescue personnel on Tuesday began pumping out water from the flooded rat-hole coal mine in Meghalaya’s East Jaintia Hills district, where many miners are feared dead after remaining trapped since December 13. The day saw the district authorities release an official list of 15 trapped miners, though one of the five who survived claimed that there were 17 inside the 350 ft deep mine. R. Susngi, spokesperson for the district administration, said the Odisha Fire Service personnel pumped out water from an old shaft near the main one that the trapped miners had used to descend. “After three hours of pumping, the water level in the old shaft was found to have gone down by up to six inches,” he said. The Odisha Fire Service will continue dewatering on Wednesday. The multiple rescue agencies expect to determine the water level after eight hours of pumping. Midway through Tuesday’s operation, the East Jaintia Hills district authorities released the names of 15 trapped miners.

Cong. flexes ‘Shakti’ to decide candidates|New Delhi|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|As the Congress gets ready for the big battle in 2019 to take on the BJP, the process it will follow to select candidates is likely to undergo a major shift. The party is increasingly adopting a feedback-based system of shortlisting candidates through its internal app Shakti, which allows ordinary workers to have a say on who could be the winning candidate from a particular constituency. “The feedback on the app will certainly be one of the inputs, but can’t be the only factor in deciding the candidate,” said a Congress functionary familiar with the functioning of the Shakti app. The Congress seems to be enthused by its experience in the recently concluded elections in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan where the app was used to take feedback on the chief ministerial candidate, get data about voting behaviour of every booth and weak spots for the party in past elections. “Party leaders were getting live data and feedback from 15,000-odd booths each in M.P. and Rajasthan and around 10,000 in Chhattisgarh every day in the run-up to the Assembly elections,” said the Congress functionary. 1,000 points But contrary to reports, feedback is not sought from the nearly five million workers who are registered on the app. “Feedback is sought only from workers who have accumulated 1,000 points against their name,” says the Congress office-bearer. Verified Congress workers have been given points and are graded according to their engagement with the app. The data generated by the Shakti app is directly monitored by Congress president Rahul Gandhi since he had revamped the erstwhile computer department of the Congress into data analytics wing. And the performance of this app is also being monitored by Mr. Gandhi himself. Take for example, Karnataka, where the party is in a coalition government. Until the third week of December 2018, there were 12.3 lakh registered users and as many 40,000 workers were registered on a single day. These workers were then mapped against the 54,206 booths in the State. Data then shows how many booths are covered by Shakti workers. Of the total number of booths, 43,542 or 80% booths in Karnataka are covered by Shakti.|0|

RSS reminds PM of temple promise|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) on Tuesday reminded Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the the BJP’s Palampur resolution on Ayodhya in 1989 and its election manifesto for 2014 after the latter in an interview to ANI said that an ordinance to aid the construction of a Ram temple was possible only after the legal process was dealt with. The RSS and its affiliate, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), have been pushing for an ordinance on the construction of a Ram temple ahead of the conclusion of the case before the Supreme Court which does not appear close to a resolution. In this situation the RSS, in a series of tweets put out by its joint general secretary Dattatreya Hosabele, termed Mr. Modi’s statement as “constructive” but also hoped that the BJP’s own resolution on temple construction via talks or legal process could be done “within the term of this government”. The VHP’s acting president, Alok Kumar, toldThe Hinduthat the organisation’s top officials would be meeting on Wednesday morning and that he would be addressing a press conference in the afternoon. “We have to formulate a response after seeking views from all,” Mr. Kumar said.|0|
Cinereous vulture seen in Jharkhand|Kolkata|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|It is usually during the winter that a distinctly dark large bird – the Cinereous vulture, with a blacked-tipped pink beak – migrates from the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia to warmer places, including India. While earlier records of this migratory bird have revealed that it comes to northern parts of India up to Rajasthan, bird watchers and researchers were baffled to find it in Hazaribagh, Jharkhand. Shib Shankar Goswami, a bird enthusiast, spotted the vulture in Hazaribagh on December 30. “I was doing a nature walk with a group of bird enthusiasts, called Bird’s Buddy, when I spotted the vulture perched on a tree. Interestingly, the Cinereous vulture (classified as Near Threatened under the IUCN Red List) was found with three other endangered species of vultures,” Mr. Goswami said. “Initially, I could not believe a sight where four rare vultures were seen in one frame, but the photographs taken at the spot revealed what can be a bird watcher’s delight,” he added. According to him, the three other vultures in the frame were the Himalyan Griffon, White-rumped vulture and the Long-billed vulture. Smitha Pankaj, Divisional Forest Officer (Hazaribag East), confirmed the presence of the visitor from far off countries to Jharkhand. “We have spotted the Cinerous vulture for the first time in the region,” the DFO said, adding that five species of vultures, including the Himalayan Griffon, were spotted in Hazaribagh recently.|0|

‘Cong. framed Shah in Sohrabuddin case’|NEW DELHI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The BJP on Tuesday accused the Congress, especially UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Congress president Rahul Gandhi, of having tried to “frame” BJP president Amit Shah in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh case when the party was in power at the Centre. Union Minister Smriti Irani said the case was an example of the “lengths to which the Congress will go to destroy its political opponents”. She said Mr. Shah, a Minister in the Gujarat government of Narendra Modi in 2010, was harassed by the CBI at the behest of the Congress leadership that identified him and Mr. Modi as its main rivals. “Evidence was manufactured in an attempt to destroy Mr. Shah politically,” she said. She accused Mr. Gandhi of supporting a terrorist, in a reference to his tweet on the Sohrabuddin Sheikh case verdict that “nobody killed” him and he “just died”. “The court admitted that these cases were imposed on Mr. Shah for political reasons. Not just in the Mumbai High Court but also in the Supreme Court, the Congress’s conspiracy got defeated,” Ms. Irani said. All 22 accused in the 2005-06 fake encounter killings of Sohrabuddin Shaikh, his wife Kausar Bi and aide Tulsiram Prajapati were acquitted on December 21 by a special CBI court in Mumbai because of insufficient evidence.|0|

Mr. Modi dismissed claims by some political pundits that the BJP might not get more than 180 of the 543 seats, saying there were a similar “set of persons” who echoed a similar narrative even in 2014. “I believe, this election is going to be a contest between those who fulfil and take forward the aspirations of the people and those who stop these aspirations. There is experience of 70 years. The public is the decider,” the Prime Minister said, when asked if the 2019 elections were heading towards a U.S. presidential-style of elections between Mr. Modi and Congress president Rahul Gandhi. Asked if the election would be an “anybody but Modi” contest as projected by the Opposition parties, he said, “It is going to bejanta[public] versusgathbandhan[coalition]. Modi is just a manifestation of public love and blessings,” he said. “The public knows that earlier it was decentralised corruption, those who sat in the States, looted the States, those who were in the Centre, looted at the Centre... The people will decide whether or not they should ally with these forces of corruption who are coming together,” he said. Attacking the anti-BJP parties, he said there was no unity among them in any way, nor any joint articulation about what they would do for the country. On the allegation by Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister and TDP leader N. Chandrababu Naidu that the efforts being made by Telangana Chief Minister and TRS supremo K. Chandrashekar Rao to form an alliance had his blessings, he said: “I am not aware that some coalition is being made by KCR.” Asked about Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray’s attack on him when he echoed Congress president Rahul Gandhi in sayingChowkidar chor hai(guard is the thief), he said, “Sometimes, some expectations are not met” and some allies feel that they “could benefit by putting pressure” on the BJP. Asked if there was any move to make film stars-turned-politicians Rajinikanth and Kamal Hassan to join the NDA and improve the NDA’s footprint in South India, he said, “We are ready to take everyone along, those who want to come with us, those with whom we can walk. It is linked to our strengthening the regional aspirations.” Rafale deal On the Rafale deal, he said those levelling allegations against him were actually weakening the security forces. He would continue to expedite the defence procurement process. Asked why he was silent on the Congress accusation of favouring Anil Ambani, Mr. Modi replied, “This is not an allegation against me personally, but an allegation against my government. If there is any allegation against me personally, let them dig who gave what, when and where and to whom.” Taking aim on the “first family” of the Congress, he said that those who ran the country for four generations were today facing charges of financial irregularities and were out on bail. Tongue firmly in cheek, he responded to the remark that those accused in the scams were taking walks in Lodhi Garden, saying that those on bail had freedom given by courts to walk in the park. Dubbing the loan waivers announced by the Congress governments as a “political stunt”, he said a majority of farmers do not benefit from these “misleading” announcements as only a few of them take loans from banks.|0|
Odisha may hike relief for death in wildlife attack|BHUBANESWAR|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Odisha Forest and Environment Department has proposed to the State government to increase the compensation for human deaths caused in conflict with animals from Rs. 4 lakh to Rs. 5 lakh. The department has also decided to procure special vans to rescue wild animals in distress. “The department has proposed to increase the compensation amount for human deaths caused by wildlife from Rs. 4 lakh to Rs. 5 lakh. We hope it would have a positive impact in the region affected by man-wildlife conflicts,” said Sandeep Tripathi, Principal Chief Conservator of Forest (Wildlife), here on Tuesday. The proposal has been sent to State government for approval, Mr. Tripathi added. Between 2011-12 and 2018-19, as many as 680 people died in wild animal attacks. Of these, 535 were killed by elephants. During the same period, 6,417 houses were damaged by elephant herds. Special vehicles The forest department is in the process of procuring four special vehicles equipped with a crane to rescue elephants in distress. These vehicles would also have a few veterinarians on board to attend to the animals. The vehicles, each costing about Rs. 25 lakh, would also be used to chase tuskers away from human habitations. The Odisha Forest and Environment Department has sought the help of its West Bengal counterpart in the procurement of these vehicles. Since 2011-12, a total of 548 jumbos have died in Odisha with the annual average loss estimated at 70.|0|
Vande Mataram not sung at M.P. Secretariat|Bhopal|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The incident of ‘Vande Mataram’ not being sung on the the first working day of January at Madhya Pradesh Secretariat came to light with the Opposition BJP on Tuesday pointing fingers at Chief Minister Kamal Nath. Singing of the national song in the Mantralaya or Secretariat on the first working day of every month has been the norm since the time of erstwhile Shivraj Singh Chouhan government. Madhya Pradesh General Administration Department Additional Chief Secretary Prabhanshu Kamal could not be contacted despite repeated calls. State unit BJP spokesman Rajneesh Agrawal tweeted that the rendition of Vande Mataram is organised by the GAD, a portfolio held by Mr. Nath. “Has it been on his direction? He (Nath) has recently said that he does not care for criticism. Is there going to be a ban on ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ chant (sic),” Mr. Agrawal tweeted. State Congress spokesman Bhupendra Gupta sought to play down the incident, saying the Chief Minister is out of station. He said the rendition couldn’t take place as the new Chief Secretary took charge on Tuesday, implying that the officials remained busy. “If it was not sung today, it will take place tomorrow or later.”|0|

Verdict today on online sale of medicines|CHENNAI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|A Division Bench of the Madras High Court is slated to deliver its verdict on Wednesday on a batch of petitions filed by e-pharma firms to stay the operation of an order passed by a single judge of the court on December 17 banning online sale of medicines till the Centre notifies the statutory rules to regulate the trade. Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and P. Rajamanickam would be delivering their verdict on the stay petitions filed along with a batch of writ appeals seeking to set aside the order passed by Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana, who also directed the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to notify the rules on or before January 31. The ban was imposed following a writ petition filed by Tamil Nadu Chemists and Druggists Association, which contended that it was illegal to sell medicines through online portals and mobile phone apps when the proposed amendments to Drugs and Cosmetics Rules of 1945 were still in the draft stage and yet to be notified in the gazette. Concurring with the association, Justice Sathyanarayana held that online sale of medicines could not be permitted till the rules were brought into force and every other e-pharma gets registered with the central licensing authority and made to adhere to the regulations to be put in force by amending the existing statutory rules. However, at the request of a host of a league of senior counsel representing the e-pharma firms, the judge kept the implementation of her order in abeyance till they prefer an appeal. Subsequently, while reserving its verdict on the stay petitions on December 20, the Division Bench extended the moratorium till it delivered its verdict. Assailing the single judge’s order before the Bench, the e-pharma firms contended that their trade could not be termed as an illegal activity when the Centre itself had proposed only to regulate the trade by subjecting it to statutory laws. Imposing a ban would lead to a chaos among people dependent on online sale, they contended. It was also submitted that no e-pharma firm sold medicines without insisting on submitting scanned copies of prescriptions and verifying them through qualified pharmacists engaged both by the home delivery partners as well as the pharmacies through which the drugs were procured and supplied to the consumers.|0|
A year on, Rajini fans still waiting for party launch|CHENNAI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|After keeping his fans on tenterhooks for many years, Tamil film star Rajinikanth announced on December 31, 2017, that he will take the political plunge and contest the next Assembly elections. A year later, his supporters are still waiting for him to lay out concrete plans and an ideology for his party. The year 2018 began with a bang — the actor set up the Rajini Makkal Mandram (RMM), the launch vehicle for his proposed political party, on January 1 to bring all his registered and unregistered fan clubs under one umbrella. Subsequently, he met senior political figures in Tamil Nadu, including former DMK president M. Karunanidhi and former AIADMK stalwart R.M. Veerappan – all in the first week of January. In the same month, he sent a team to tour the State and set up a party structure, beginning with the appointment of district secretaries to the lowest block in the party chain. By April, the party structure had been created and its cadre given member enrolment targets (at least 30 members in each booth). Over the next few months, RMM cadre worked towards delivering on their targets. With the political project seemingly going full steam ahead, it was expected that Mr. Rajinikanth would launch his party by the end of the year. But the expectation did not materialise. Speaking toThe Hindu, an RMM office-bearer said that though the cadre were disappointed over the delay, the party was actually ready to be launched.  Handling controversies It did not help that Mr. Rajinikanth was embroiled in a few controversies. Despite having clearly stated that he won’t comment on political issues till he launched his party, he was forced to do that in some instances. Apart from having to clarify whether he was being propped up by the BJP, he also appeared to have lost his cool when he said the protests against Sterlite Copper in Thoothukudi had been infiltrated by anti-social elements and that continuous protests would turn T.N. into a graveyard. RMM office-bearers said his preference to contest primarily in the Assembly election had certainly delayed the launch of his party. “The reaction has been mixed on the ground – a section of his fans feels he should launch the party because they are facing challenges on the ground. They are feeling the negativity. ButThalaivarseems to be very clear that he won't contest in the Lok Sabha election,” an office-bearer said.

‘State judiciary bogged down by unfilled vacancies’|CHENNAI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Judicial officers are hoping that judicial vacancies across the State are filled in 2019, as it would speed up disposal of cases in each district. Speaking on condition of anonymity, a judicial officer pointed out that even significant posts such as presiding officers of mahila courts, family courts, special courts for exclusive trial of land grabbing cases, motor accident claims tribunals and labour courts were lying vacant with other judicial officers given additional charge. A news report carried inThe Hinduon December 26 regarding district courts in the State all set to enter 2019 with a backlog of over 11 lakh cases has caused a quite a stir among judicial officers, who blame the huge number of judicial vacancies in almost every district for the delay in disposing of 6.24 lakh civil and 4.80 lakh criminal cases. “Mahila courts are constituted for the specific purpose of expeditious disposal of cases within six months. The Supreme Court itself has been monitoring the progress of such courts. Yet, the posts of presiding officers of Mahila Courts in Erode, Madurai and a few other districts have been lying vacant for long, causing grave injustice to victims,” a trial judge said. According to him, victims of rape and molestation have no choice but to appear before the in-charge courts on a regular basis, listen to the next date of adjournment and repeat the sequence over and over again. “Such unproductive adjournments may lead to witnesses’ memory fading and in fact, help the accused escape from the clutches of law,” he added. Another judicial officer pointed out that the posts of secretary to District Legal Services Authority and chairperson of Taxation Appellate Tribunal Authority in municipal corporations were also lying vacant in some districts, causing hitches in the conduct of legal awareness camps in villages and providing free legal aid to the poor. Game changer When contacted, the office-bearers of Tamil Nadu Judicial Officers Association (TNJOA) refused to comment on the issue. However, Madras High Court officials involved in the recruitment process were confident that 2019 would be a game changer in filling up of judicial vacancies in the State. According to them, vacancies in mahila courts and family courts could be filled up only with judicial officers in the cadre of district judge. Since, filling up those vacancies through promotions would cause a sudden vacuum in the feeder category of civil judges, it was decided to fill up the latter first before taking up the former. It was in 2015 that the last recruitment of civil judges took place in the State. A year later, the Rights of Persons with Disablities Act came into force. Though the High Court quickly identified the posts, which could be reserved under the Act, the State government took quite a long time to approve the list and issue a government order. Notification issued “A notification was issued on April 9, 2017, calling for applications for approximately 320 civil judge vacancies. More than 8,000 candidates applied. After a conducting a main examination, followed by a preliminary examination for shortlisted candidates and then a viva voce, we have provisionally selected over 220 civil judges,” a judicial officer said. “This recruitment has been completed in record time. These judges will join service soon and undergo in-service training at the Tamil Nadu Judicial Academy in batches. Once these judicial officers settle down, we will commence filling up vacancies in the cadre of district judges too through promotions as well as direct recruiment,” the officer also asserted.

State to focus on curbing leprosy at block-level|CHENNAI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|After the move to actively look for leprosy cases yielded results in the last few years, the Public Health Department is now aiming at lowering the prevalence rate of the disease to less than one person per 10,000 by 2020 at the block-level. This will be the State’s own target, as it had already achieved the district-level prevalence rate reduction in 2005 as fixed by the Central government, Health Department officials said. District-level target “Though, we achieved the target in 2005, we wanted to go further to the block-level. So, we are taking blocks as units. Out of the 385 blocks in the State, at least 30 to 50 blocks have a prevalence rate of more than one person per 10,000. We will focus on these blocks and reduce the rate by 2020,,” said K. Kolandaswamy, Director of Public Health and Preventive Medicine. Active case finding drives have helped the department to trace hidden cases in the last few years, he added. “There was sharp increase in the number of new cases during 2015-16. Similarly, we were able to detect more cases during 2016-2017 and 2017-2018. Currently, leprosy’s prevalence rate is 0.39 in the State,” Mr. Kolandaswamy said. It was in 2012 that the department realised that just voluntary reporting of cases at health facilities were not enough, added S. Mohammed Afzal Ali, Additional Director, Leprosy. “So, we started to look at blocks that had a high prevalence rate through active searches. These continuous efforts have been helping us detect new cases and treat them so that the infection rate can be reduced first at the block-level. Then, we plan to move on to the primary health centre-level and after that, the village-level,” he said. Post-exposure treatment Two active searches last year — Active Leprosy Case Finding in 87 blocks and Leprosy Case Detection Campaign in 17 districts — detected 684 and 688 new cases respectively, officials said. S. Thirunavukkarasu, State Leprosy Consultant, said they have rolled out post-exposure prophylaxis to tackle the disease’s contagiousness. “Studies have shown that a single prophylactic dose of rifampicin could reduce the chances of infection by 60% in those who have come in contact with patients. Currently, 4,000 patients are under treatment, and each could have 10 to 20 contacts, who will receive the dose. This includes family members and neighbours,” he added.  We plan to move to the primary health centre-level and then, village-level S. Mohammed Afzal Ali Additional Director, Public Health and Preventive Medicine|0|
CM accuses Bedi of ‘making up blatant lies’ on Pongal gifts|Puducherry|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Accusing Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi of making up ‘blatant lies’ on Pongal gift scheme, Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy said Ms. Bedi had issued a notification last year invoking changes in the scheme without consulting the Council of Ministers. Addressing a press conference here on Tuesday, the Chief Minister said without the knowledge of the Council of Ministers the Lt. Governor had on January 30, 2018, issued a notification restricting distribution of Pongal gifts to persons belonging to the Below Poverty Line category. The Pongal free rice scheme was in vogue for several years after getting due approval from the State Planning Board, Council of Ministers, Planning Commission (now NITI Aayog) and Union Ministry of Home Affairs. The Lt. Governor had made changes in the scheme without getting the mandatory approval of the Council of Ministers, he said. As per the Rules of Business of the Government of Puducherry, 1963, the Lt. Governor was duty-bound to hold discussion with the Council of Ministers in case of differences of opinion on existing schemes. In case the differences persist, as per the rule, the Chief Minister said the administrator had to refer the matter to the Council of Ministers. “In the case of changing the rules of the scheme, Ms. Bedi has not received the mandatory approval of the Council of Ministers,” the Chief Minister said. Mr. Narayanasamy said the Minister for Civil Supplies again on November 29, 2018 sent a file to the Lt. Governor seeking her approval for distributing Pongal gifts to all ration card holders during the current year. Accusing Ms. Bedi of acting in an arbitrary manner, the Chief Minister said the Office of the Lt. Governor was used to subvert the elected government. Questioning the role of officer on special duty in Raj Nivas G. Theva Neethi Dhas in executing administrative responsibilities, the Chief Minister said the MHA had only recommended the appointment of Mr. Dhas as a consultant after his retirement as Secretary to the Lt. Governor. Mr. Narayanasamy said the Lt. Governor had appointed Mr. Dhas against rules and objections raised by the Chief Minister’s Office. “Apart from Ms. Bedi, there are four Lt. Governor’s sitting at Raj Nivas executing administrative powers. The Chief Secretary has to even take orders from the OSD,” Mr. Narayanasamy said. He also challenged the Lt. Governor to hold a media briefing on issues rather than issuing statements and putting messages on WhatsApp. “I am showing courage to face the media. Why doesn’t the Lt. Governor brief the media and take questions on issues,” he said. Bedi replies Hitting back at Mr. Narayanasamy, the Lt. Governor said the Chief Minister was part of the decision making change to the rules of free Pongal gifts distribution. In a WhatsApp message, Ms. Bedi said the file seeking her approval for free distribution of Pongal gifts to all ration card holders was returned to the Chief Minister. “He has been reminded that as per the notification of January last year, of which he was a part, it was decided that it was limited to BPL and red ration card holders,” the Lt. Governor said. Ms. Bedi said no money had been set aside exclusively for free Pongal gifts in the budget. The money for providing gifts was taken from funds allotted for rice scheme meant for the poor.|0|
Assembly session likely to be stormy|CHENNAI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Tamil Nadu Assembly session beginning Wednesday with Governor Banwarilal Purohit’s address is expected to be stormy for a number of reasons. The DMK, the main Opposition in the House, has lined up a series of issues to put the AIADMK government in a spot. These include the shocking case of a pregnant woman contracting HIV due to transfusion of infected blood at the Sattur Government Hospital, the havoc caused by cyclone Gaja, the favourable order obtained by Sterlite Copper from the National Green Tribunal, the CBI grilling of Health Minister in the gutkha scam and the latest political controversy surrounding former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s death. The AIADMK, however, is pulling its socks to counter the anticipated attack from the Opposition. “The DMK has been asking for a full-fledged session to commemorate the memory of their departed leader M. Karunanidhi and it may be conceded,” a Minister said. He added that the Opposition could not corner the government on the issue of Global Investors Meet (GIM) as the AIADMK can boast that it was able to attract investments to the tune of Rs. 16,000 crore through 17 projects cleared so far. Jaya’s death “We are not on the wrong foot at all. Foxconn is going to manufacture iPhone from Chennai for the first time and local investment is gaining ground in spite of complaints against GST and other taxes,” he contended. But the Opposition leaders said the government had the duty to explain why its Ministers were speaking in different voices after appointing a commission to probe the circumstances that led to the hospitalisation and subsequent death of Jayalalithaa. A DMK MLA said while Law Minister C.Ve. Shanmugam went to the extent of demanding action against the State Health Secretary, Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam distanced himself from the issue saying it was the personal opinion of Mr Shanmugam. “We want to know whether the Cabinet is taking decisions unanimously or every body is functioning independently,” said the DMK MLA. The DMK leaders agreed though there were plenty of issues that need to be discussed in the Assembly, but everything depended on its duration. “The government and the Speaker may not allow us to raise all the issues, particularly those they find embarrassing,” a DMK leader alleged.|0|

Hotels embrace ban, say rates may go up|CHENNAI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Ever since the ban on plastics was announced by the Tamil Nadu government, hotels and restaurants across the State are working on various options and some have even adopted innovative methods. While some hotels have embraced the traditional methods, others have asked customers to bring in their own vessels for takeaways. Hotel Saravana Bhavan, one of the largest food chains, has informed all its branches to stop using plastic and start using paper-based products. Similarly, Dindigul Thalappakatti has started using wooden spoons and paper straws. Its Managing Director, Sathish D. Nagasamy, said instructions had been given to all their branches to use paper bags. “Over 30% of our business is through takeaways,” he added. Sastharam Ravendran, founder, Madras Curry Cup, said, “We were using a combination of glass, eco-friendly plates likepaaku mattaiandthonnaiat some outlets, bio-degradable carry bags, and thicker reuse capable plastics boxes with 60 ppi or more that the government has not banned.” Hoteliers across Chennai said that they are prepared for the ban but the biggest challenge is bridging the gap between demand and supply. Since everyone is now looking at alternative options, there is a huge shortage. “My supplier has said that he does not have sufficient cloth bags to give me. Supply is a constraint,” said a city-based hotelier. He added, “Prices of eco- friendly products could have been subsidised. Or input credit tax could have been enabled for restaurants, so it would have helped us offset the price hike. Now we have no choice but to absorb part of the cost increase and pass a part to the consumers.” Many hotels have indicated that they would have to increase the rates on their menu cards. Vivek Srinivasan, executive director, Sree Annapoorna Sree Gowrishankar Hotels, said the cost of a south Indian meal could go up by nearly Rs. 30 if we cannot use plastic pouches to pack liquid food items, such as sambar and rasam.” A south Indian meal will have at least eight varieties of food. “We use plastic pouches now. We can go in for bio pouches but might not be able to pack hot food in it. So the option is to go in for plastic containers that can be reused,” he said. Hotel Nalan, which has two branches in Coimbatore, has asked its customer to bring containers for takeaways.  Food delivery platforms are prepared for the plastic ban and are working with hotels across Chennai. “We plan to give benefits to restaurants that are shifting to eco-friendly packaging by providing them additional marketing visibility benefits on our platforms — app and web. This will help offset any additional cost for partner outlets through higher customer interest,” said a spokesperson of Zomato. The spokesperson further added, “Bamboo products [which also provide employment to tribal communities], corrugated paper with coatings and sugarcane bagasse products will be also supplied.” Swiggy is launching ‘Swiggy Packaging Assist’ Program — a marketplace for restaurant partners to access a variety of packing solutions. Small eateries Roadside eateries and small restaurants (which operate out of a 300 sq ft space) are still evaluating how they can replace plastic. Some of them even said that the ban would not last long and would die a natural death. A restaurant owner in Triplicane said, “A few months back there was a huge noise about banning Coke and Pepsi and now that issue is dead and the products are back on shelves. How long will the government keep monitoring usage of plastics,” he asked.|0|
FIR filed in purchase of AI, IA planes|NEW DELHI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Investigating agencies have allegedly come across evidence indicating that the acquisition of 111 aircraft for Air India and the erstwhile Indian Airlines, decided in 2004, had been at rates higher than the price paid around the same time by some private airlines. “It seems the aircraft sold to the then Indian Airlines and Air India was costlier as compared to those bought by certain private airliners. If it was the case, where exactly the differential was adjusted has to be looked into,” an official said. An FIR registered by the CBI, in which unknown officials of the Civil Aviation Ministry, Central government and Air India are being probed states that the decision had been taken to get the aircraft for about Rs. 70,000 crore. No benchmark In its 2011 report, the CAG observed: “To enable effective price negotiations, it is normal (and was also necessary) to make an assessment through commercial intelligence gathered globally to assess a reasonable or threshold price (based on comparable prices paid by other buyers and other factors). However, no benchmarks for the cost of the aircraft were set by AIL [Air India Limited]/MoCA [Ministry of Civil Aviation] before negotiations were initiated.” The agencies are also looking into the alleged losses to the national carrier on account of “liberalisation of bilateral agreements”, the timing of which — given the timing of aircraft acquisition and other factors — did not provide a level playing field to Air India, as pointed out by the CAG report. “The capacity entitlements under various bilateral agreements during the period from January 2004 (pre-liberalisation) till March 2010 had increased by 282%,” it said.|0|

Revellers go on the rampage in park|CHENNAI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Revellers went on the rampage at an amusement park in Injambakkam, disappointed over denial of adequate food and drinks, despite the organisers collecting huge sums for entry. A private entertainment firm had organised New Year celebrations in the open area of the VGP Golden Beach Injambakkam on Monday night. They had sold tickets worth Rs. 1,500 for a person and Rs. 3,000 for couples, offering discounts such as unlimited liquor. With crowds swelling beyond expectations, no proper arrangements were made to serve food and liquor. Moreover, the organisers failed to conduct the programme as per the schedule given earlier. Venue ransacked People were disappointed as they did not get food at 9 p.m. According to the participants, the organisers stopped serving liquor early. Infuriated, the guests had heated arguments with the staff of the firm. Since there was no response from the staff, the guests ransacked the venue. The police had to intervene, and had a tough time getting the crowd to disperse. When the irate guests demanded their money back, police personnel resorted to force. The programme was abruptly stopped. Neither the guests nor the organisers have preferred any complaint with the police. “We paid Rs. 25,000 for our family to celebrate the New Year. We did not expect that such an unfortunate event would occur. The organisers sold more tickets and allowed more persons than what the capacity of the premises permitted,” said a woman who was here to participate in the event.|0|
Nearly 600 elders rescued from Chennai in 2018|Chennai|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Nearly 600 senior citizens were rescued from different parts of the city in 2018 by the HelpAge India volunteers. While assault on elders has reduced drastically, most of them, especially men, are being abused by relatives for property, say officials. The Elders Helpline 1253 received around 3,100 calls between January and December in 2018. Out of these, 420 were rescue calls in which senior citizens abandoned on the roads were saved. Most of them were found near railway stations, bus stops and hospitals. A total of 169 pertained to abuse. Bleak state of affairs “An analysis of the rescues showed that among the abandoned, a majority of them were women. This is because most of them became dependent on their children after retirement or death of their husband. They were either shunned or left home unable to cope,” said an official from HelpAge. Most of the abuse victims were elderly men. “Most often the property is with them and they are tortured by relatives for it. The men call the helpline, while the women bear the torture and leave home,” added the official. Most of the calls to the helpline were from south and west Chennai where awareness is more. “Few calls from north Chennai were with the help of their friends. The police have been of great help as they give an FIR immediately so that we can admit them in one of the old age homes,” explained the official. More awareness HelpAge India will be creating more awareness about the Maintenance of Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act and the helpline across the city and State in the coming days. “We need to increase the number of old age homes and we also need more volunteers in the districts,” the official added.|0|

Corporation to begin raids today|CHENNAI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Starting Wednesday, the Corporation will begin raids on ‘storage points’ of banned plastic products. According to estimates, more than 1,000 premises are likely to still have stockpiles of banned plastic products in various parts of the city. The areas where huge quantities of banned plastic products have been reportedly stored include Perambur, Madhavaram, George Town, Porur, T. Nagar, Anna Nagar and Ayanavaram. Senior officials of the Chennai Corporation said they did not carry out raids on violators of the plastic ban on Tuesday. However, local-level officials at each of the 200 wards have started collecting information on storage of banned plastic products with support from sources among traders. The Corporation has been able to collect just 1.8 tonnes of banned plastic products from those having such stockpiles. “Banned plastic products will be collected at 200 ward offices. The plastics will be shredded and used for road relaying,” said an official. The civic body has been creating awareness among traders to deposit the banned plastic products at any of the 200 ward offices of the Corporation for the past few days. In case of raids, the Corporation officials will seal the premises after seizing the banned plastic products. “We will not seal smaller retail outlets. We will only seize the banned plastic products from them. Huge premises with a very large quantity of banned plastic products will be sealed,” said an official. Teams formed The Corporation had already formed teams in all the 15 zones to create awareness of the plastics ban. The officials have warned them about a fine of Rs. 10,000. “The officials also said they would cancel the trade licence for retailers using banned plastic products,” said a shopkeeper on Nungambakkam High Road on Tuesday. Corporation Commissioner D. Karthikeyan said, “We are determined to implement the ban. At the same time, we should not be erratic.”|0|

OPS distances himself from Minister over Jaya’s death|Chennai|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Deputy Chief Minister and AIADMK coordinator O. Panneerselvam on Tuesday distanced himself and the party from Law Minister C.Ve. Shanmugam’s controversial statement seeking the constitution of a Special Investigation Team to probe former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s death. The Minister had on Monday raised doubts about the treatment administered to Jayalalithaa, the conduct of Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan and the food bills at the hospital and demanded a probe into her death. Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar endorsed Mr. Shanmugam’s views. On Tiruvarur bypoll When asked about the issue, Mr. Panneerselvam said, “Whatever opinion Mr. Shanmugam had expressed, I consider it his personal view.” To a query on the AIADMK’s prospects in the Tiruvarur bypoll, Mr. Panneerselvam said, “Irrespective of whether we contest on our own or by forming an alliance, we will post an impressive victory.”|0|
Pulikulam cattle offer benefits beyond jallikattu|CHENNAI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Pulikulam cattle, the ferocious indigenous breed used in jallikattu, have great potential as milk- and manure-yielding animals, if harnessed properly, according to scientists of the Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (Tanuvas). “They are resistant to many diseases, including tuberculosis and brucellosis, a disease that leads to abortion in animals. I have not come across any study that has reported about the prevalence of foot-and-mouth disease in the Pulikulam breed, though wild animals fall victim to this disease,” said S. Sivaseelan, professor and head of the Pulikulam Cattle Research Station, Manamadurai, which was recently set up by Tanuvas. In a parallel effort, veterinarians from the Veterinary College and Research Institute in Orathanadu have collected and deposited samples of the breed for further genetic research. “In Madurai alone, there are 16,000 animals, and we have to collect samples with the help of the shepherds as the animals are unapproachable. They graze in herds and farmers make them stay on their fields as their dung and urine enrich the soil,” said A.S. Selvaramesh, who has spent almost two years collecting samples from the cattle. Dr. Sivaseelam said 80% of the work on building the research centre, coming up on 44 acres, had been completed, and Tanuvas had bought 20 animals, which were being kept in Kattupakkam in Chennai. It was planning to purchase more animals soon. Benefits outweigh costs “They can yield up to two litres of milk, but milking is not done because they are kept in a herd of a minimum of 500. First, we have to increase the yield by five litres, and then propagate the idea of rearing just two or three animals per house,” Dr. Sivaseelan said. The cost of the native breed’s milk is double that of foreign breeds, but it requires very little maintenance and inputs in terms of fodder. There is also a huge demand for the dung of the Pulikulam breed in Kerala, with farmers paying Rs. 10 per kg of dung, which they convert into manure for cash crops like pepper and cardamom. In Kerala, they dry the dung and sell the final product for a higher price. Dr. Sivaseelan said genetic research would help identify and create purebred males. “A six-month-old male costs between Rs. 20,000 and Rs. 25,000. If it wins a prize in jallikattu, its price would increase to Rs. 1 lakh,” he said.|0|
Cold weather may continue in Chennai for the next two days|CHENNAI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|It was a ‘cool’ New Year for Chennaites as the city recorded one of the lowest temperatures in the last one week. According to the Meteorological department, the cold weather is expected to continue for the next two days. On Monday, the Meteorological department recorded a minimum temperature of 19.7 degrees Celsius in Nungambakkam and 17.8 in Meenambakkam. “This is the coldest temperature when compared to the last one week. The temperature last dipped to 21 degrees two days ago and after this, Monday morning saw the lowest. “This climate is bound to last for two more days,” said an official. The reason for this is the Northerly winds, clear sky and low moisture, claim weather experts. “The weather may or may not drop further. We have to wait and see,” added the officials. Low Pressure  Meanwhile, official said that the northeast monsoon is on the withdrawal mode. However, a low-pressure system is likely to emerge in the Andaman Sea on January 5. “If the wind moves it towards Chennai, the city may see some rain,” said an official.  The Met department recorded a minimum temperature of 19.7 degrees Celsius in Nungambakkam|0|
‘T.N. likely to see use of big data ahead of Lok Sabha polls’|CHENNAI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|With a number of political parties across the world using big data to reach out to voters during elections, Tamil Nadu too is likely to see the use of big data combined with artificial intelligence ahead of the Lok Sabha polls. With the voters’ list, census data, data from all the past elections and social media chatter, parties could crack the polls, addressing issues that are key to voters, according to K. Swaminathan, founder and CEO, Aspire Ventures. Building on the platform he provided to late Jayalalithaa during the 2014 and 2016 elections, Mr. Swaminathan has developed the ‘Analytical Software for Psephological Influencers Research and Engagement’ or Aspire 2.0 as he calls it, which uses AI and machine learning to provide real-time inputs to enable leaders to address issues or plan for the polls. Mr. Swaminathan, who was former secretary of the AIADMK IT wing, insists that the platform is “party independent” and can be used by any political party. The software enables a party to look at voting patterns from the previous elections and at data to identify gaps and ensure that they are plugged. “For example, you can do a ‘margin analysis’, where one can take a constituency and generate booth-level data, filter the results by margins, so that you get a clear picture of where you (party) stand in a booth,” he said. According to him, the AI also works on something called as a ‘SentiMeter’, analysing social media posts, Youtube videos, news, and get the sentiment meter of a topic.|0|
Thief gets stuck in well, rescued after two days|CHENNAI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|A thief, being chased by a police patrol team, entered a well to evade arrest and got stuck there. He remained there for two days and was rescued on Monday by Fire and Rescue Services and police personnel. A police team was patrolling in Chandrasekarapuram when they spotted Jaisingh, 44, of Old Washermanpet, moving about suspiciously, and chased him. He fled and climbed down the well. After hiding there for some time, he was unable to climb out. He kept shouting but to no avail. After two days, some people heard him and alerted the authorities. Using a rope, he was rescued and handed over to the police. Jaisingh was wanted for three murder and 19 other cases.

Fire breaks out at unit near Ambattur|CHENNAI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|A fire broke out at a plastics manufacturing unit in Ayanambakkam, near Ambattur, on Monday. No one was injured in the incident. The company, manufacturing plastic stands for mixers and grinders, is located in Sri Devi Karumariamman Nagar in Mel Ayanambakkam.

Bhaskar, Ambattur station officer, were pressed into action, and the fire was finally doused around 8.30 p.m. “We suspect that employees forgot to switch off the machinery, causing the fire,” said an officer.|0|
‘DMK will come to power before polls’|CHENNAI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|MDMK general secretary Vaiko on Monday said that the New Year would not only see a change of government at the Centre, but may also witness the DMK coming to power even before the Assembly polls are held in Tamil Nadu. “I do not know whether the bypolls to the 19 Assembly constituencies (apart from Tiruvarur) would be held separately or along with the Lok Sabha polls. The DMK will win most of the Assembly seats and come to power even before the Assembly elections slated for 2021 since the numbers [in the Assembly] will increase in its favour,” he said. Expressing the hope that the alliance of the Congress and various regional parties would capture power after the Lok Sabha polls, Mr. Vaiko said this would pave the way for regional parties to assume an important role in national politics. He felt it was not a “hasty decision” on the part of DMK leader M.K. Stalin to propose Congress leader Rahul Gandhi as the Prime Ministerial candidate of the anti-BJP front. When asked how he could bring himself to support the Congress, given that he had blamed the party for the ‘decimation’ of Sri Lankan Tamils in the final phase of the Eelam war, Mr. Vaiko said he stood by his criticism of the Congress. “We are in the DMK alliance, and we have no objection to the DMK joining hands with the Congress. Today, the BJP and the Sangh Parivar pose a great threat to democracy and States’ rights,” he said. He took exception to Law Minister C.Ve. Shanmugam’s comments on Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan in relation to the latter’s testimony before the commission probing former CM Jayalalithaa’s death. “Do not demoralise good officers and force them to leave Tamil Nadu for Central service,” he said.|0|
Ban TikTok mobile application: Ramadoss|CHENNAI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|PMK founder S. Ramadoss on Tuesday demanded that the TikTok mobile application be banned to stop the “cultural degradation” it has triggered in society. In a statement, Dr. Ramadoss said the mobile application was being used without any regulation. “When the application was introduced, it gave young people a chance to showcase their singing and dancing talents. But it is sad to see youngsters so engrossed in the application,” he said. Dr. Ramadoss said TikTok’s users were uploading suggestive sexual dance choreography. “If a sexually explicit video gets traction online, the users would upload even more explicit videos to double the attention [they get],” he said. He added that several countries, including Indonesia, the United States and France, had raised concerns about the impact the application was having on teenagers’ minds.|0|

Handheld devices for ticket examiners distributed|CHENNAI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Printed paper charts used by ticket checking staff in long-distance trains will henceforth be sent to the shredder, with the introduction of handheld checking machines. Passengers with Reservation Against Cancellation (RAC) tickets would not have to wait for getting a berth, as the devices would provide available vacancies in real time. Southern Railway has done away with the cumbersome process that comes with using paper charts by distributing these terminals to TTEs. R.K. Kulshrestha, General Manager of Southern Railway, distributed the devices to TTEs of the two Shatabdi trains at the launch function held at the Chennai Central Railway Station on Monday. Mr. Kulshrestha said 20 machines had been distributed as part of the pilot project, under the Digital India campaign. Quick updates The machines would be put to use from Tuesday on Shatabdi Expresses that are operated from Chennai to Coimbatore and Mysuru.  The pilot project has been launched in the Chennai Division of the Southern Railway. A senior railway official said tablets linked to the passenger reservation system would give a quick update of seats available, help in quick scanning of tickets, seat vacancies against last minute cancellations, allotment of berths and faster refund to passengers who fail to show up. The tablets would help the TTEs to work with the passenger chart in offline/online mode and would result in saving huge amount of paper. Naveen Gulati, Divisional Railway Manager, Chennai Division, and other senior railway officials participated in the launch event.|0|

Short film screened against police order|CHENNAI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|A short film was screened by the Tamilnadu Vanigar Sangankalin Peravai, led by T. Vellaiyan, at the Chennai Press Club on Monday, despite an order from the city police prohibiting its screening. The film was about the plight of Thoothukudi’s residents, and compared them to the victims of the Bhopal gas tragedy in 1984. The Thoothukudi police prohibited the federation from screening the film in the town on December 28. Hence, the federation deferred from showing the film. Again, the federation planned to screen the film at the Chennai Press Club on Monday. On Sunday, the Triplicane police issued a notice to Mr. Vellaiyan.  Police communication The Law and Order Inspector said in his communication, “You are releasing the film without obtaining relevant permission from the government and police. Hence, we express our objection to the screening and you are not permitted to do so. In the event of violating this order, necessary legal action will be initiated against you.” Despite the order, the short film was screened.|0|
7 killed, over 150 injured|CHENNAI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Despite arrangements by the city police, seven persons were killed and more than 150 persons reportedly injured during New Year’s eve celebrations. Huge crowds at the Marina and Elliot’s beach welcomed the New Year, exchanging high-decibel greetings and bursting crackers. The police had made elaborate arrangements, including diversions, to regulate traffic and ensure smooth movement of public vehicles, but the spillover of people to the streets led to jams across the city. Personnel deployed Security was beefed up from 8 p.m. on Monday in the city, with the deployment of over 15,000 police personnel. Vehicle check points were set up at 368 places in the city. All flyovers were barricaded to prevent revellers from indulging in bike races on New Year’s eve. Anti-bike racing committees were formed to nab people violating the rules. But restrictions imposed by the police were not effective to prevent the revellers from indulging in excesses on the pretext of celebrations. Streets had unruly bikers vrooming and wheeling unchecked. S. Sriram, a resident of Nanganallur, said, “It was past 11 p.m., and people on two-wheelers created a ruckus on the road, relentlessly sounding the horns and boisterously wishing everybody a happy New Year.” “Though there were barricades along the road, bikers drove dangerously between the barricades,” said Ramalakshmi, a resident of Velachery. Following celebrations near the Marina beach at midnight, Kamarajar road and adjacent areas were jam-packed with vehicles for nearly two hours. “Several youths were seen on motorcycles, triple- riding without helmets and were warned by the policemen on duty. In smaller lanes of Triplicane, long lines of vehicles were moving slowly,” said Ramachandran, a resident of Triplicane. Cases booked According to the traffic police, as many as 263 cases were booked for drunk driving and over 233 cases booked for triple-riding on two-wheelers. Thirty-three cases were booked against persons who indulged in rash driving on New Year’s eve. On New Year’s day in 2017, 10 fatal accidents and 31 non-fatal accidents were reported. On New Year’s day in 2018, eight fatal accidents and 16 non-fatal accidents were reported. On the first day of 2019, the traffic police said 18 accidents were reported; of them, six were fatal accidents and 12 were non-fatal. People who lost their lives were Narasimman, 40, of Nerkundram; Vinodh, 22, of Adambakkam; Abilesh, 28, of Tondiarpet; Patel of Korattur; Jayasudhan of Kodambakkam; Baskar of Taramani; and Purushothaman of Velachery. Shopping malls and places of worship were put under strict surveillance by the police. Police Commissioner A.K. Viswanathan personally supervised security arrangements in the city. At Gandhi Square, Mr. Viswanathan cut a cake to celebrate New Year, and distributed it to children. He requested the people to return home safely.|0|
He made the nagaswaram sweeter|Chennai|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Not many know that Narasingampettai, a small town in the Thanjavur district, has an important role to play in the world of Carnatic music, especially in enriching the music of the nagaswaram. It was N.G.N. Ranagantha Asari, an ace carpenter from this village, who completely transformed the instrument, which is now known aspari nagaswaram. December 2018 marks the birth centenary of the Ranganatha Asari, who produced the instrument in collaboration with nagawaram wizard Thiruvavaduthurai T.N. Rajarathinam Pillai. “Rajarathinam Pillai wanted to replace the old, shorttimiri nagaswaraamwith a new instrument because it could not produce themathyama sruthiperfectly. He worked together with Ranganatha Asari and produced an instrument. The result is terrific. We have a pleasing sound and the instrument is also easy to handle,” said Kalaimamani Kilvelur M.G. Ganesan, a senior nagaswaram player. Mr. Ganesan, who has purchased about 200 instruments from Ranganatha Asari, said great players like Karukurichi Arunachalam and Namagiripettai Krishnan also used the instrument made by Ranganatha Asari. “Rajarathinam Pillai was pleased with the sound of the instrument and presented Ranganatha Asari a pair of diamond ear-rings. Karukurichi Arunanchalam gifted him a diamond ring,” recalled Mr. Ganesan. 36 inches long Before the arrival ofpari nagasaram, thetimiriwas used by nagaswaram players. Thetimiriproduced a high-pitched sound and demanded enormous physical effort from the musician handling it. The improvedpari nagaswaramis 36 inches long. “Timiriwas needed when there were no loudspeakers. Singers also rendered songs in a high pitch to reach out to the man sitting in the last row. Modern audio systems rendered them [these efforts] unnecessary. My father used to tell me that many nagswaram players suffered from hydrocele because oftimiri,” recalled nagaswaram player Enjikudi E.M. Subramaniam. The pipe (ulavu) of the nagaswaram is made of from the wood of theacha maram, which is known for its hardness. The lower section (anusu) is made from the wood of thevagaitree. But nagaswaram makers now are also known to purchase old wooden pillars for creating the instrument. Nagaswaram makers have also modernised their units, with machines replacing hand-drilling tools and chisels. Ranganatha Asari's sons continue to make nagaswarams today.  The result is terrific. We have a pleasing sound and the instrument is also easy to handleM.G. GanesanNagaswaram player|0|
Ban will push up food parcel charges|COIMBATORE|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Hotel Nalan, which has two branches in Coimbatore and serves primarily millet-based food, started urging customers from August 15, 2018 to bring containers for takeaways. It has stopped using plastic covers for parcel orders. Though the number of customers who ask for parcel food has reduced because of this and only now customers have started bringing their own containers, the hotel plans to continue with this practice. “With the plastic ban coming into effect this is an option,” says M. Karuppusamy, who runs the hotel. But, not all restaurants in the city are ready to switch over completely. It does not work, say hotel industry sources. If there are 100 customers who bring vessels at the same time to a hotel there will be confusion while packing. Also, the size of the containers is sometimes too small. Those who are going home from work might not carry enough food boxes with them, say the sources. Thus, almost all the 200 registered brands of hotels with the Coimbatore District Hoteliers’ Association have gone in for different options for parcel foods. Vivek Srinivasan and Jegan S. Damodarasamy, Executive Directors of Sree Annapoorna Sree Gowrishankar Hotels, say the packing cost of a south India meal works out to nearly Rs. 30 if only reusable plastic containers are used instead of plastic pouches. A south Indian meal will have at least eight varieties of food. “We used plastic pouches. We can go in for bio-pouches but might not be able to pack hot food in it. So the option is to go in for plastic containers that can be reused or eco-friendly pouches.” Office-bearers of the Coimbatore District Hoteliers Association told presspersons here on Tuesday that the cost of parcel food will go up by 7 % to 10 % on an average. The hotels will bear part of the parcel cost as they have gone in for alternatives to plastics. Apart from the containers for packing, the plastic carry bags and non-woven bags will be replaced with kraft paper bags or cloth bags. The hotels will decide individually whether the cost for this will be passed on to the customer or not. Some hotels have given the option to the customers to bring their own bags to carry the packed food. Hotel industry sources here say all these will have an impact on business. It will take about 10 or 15 days to know what are the alternative products that can be sustained. The vendors should be able to supply the alternatives in such large quantities continuously. Further, there is no clarity on use of products such as paper cups and compostable bags. There are about 3,000 food suppliers listed on some of the food delivery apps. A number of them are just kitchens catering to takeaway orders. Then there are the roadside eateries. Many of them are not even aware of the plastic ban and continued to pack food in plastic covers on Tuesday.|0|

Plastics ban evokes mixed response in city|COIMBATORE|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Ban on use of throwaway plastics, which came into effect in the State on Tuesday, evoked mixed response in the city. Most of the restaurants and retailers have switched over to alternatives. Many of the eateries have started using banana leaves for packing food. Many shops have placed boards asking customers to bring their bags. Velan, a flower merchant in Ramanathapuram, has informed his customers that he will not use plastic bags to pack flowers any more. However, several small eateries, flower merchants, and small-scale shops continued to pack products in carry bags. They are yet to know about the ban. There is also a lot of confusion on the products that are banned, say sources. S. Ramesh Raja, secretary of Coimbatore Plastic Traders’ Association, says that 80 to 100 shops in the city that sell disposable products and polythene covers are ready to go on an indefinite strike if the Government increased the number of products that are banned. There is no clarity on the use of paper cups. Similarly, the list shared by the Pollution Control Board just says polythene bags. There are no specifications regarding that. Use of plastic covers for primary packing is permitted. But these covers cannot be used in grocery stores. “We want the government to come out with proper alternatives or time till 2022 when the Central Government has said it will come out with a policy,” he says. The plastic traders in many other cities in the State have gone on strike. In Coimbatore, the officials have said that only the 14 products listed would be banned, while others would be permitted. “We will wait and see,” he says. The Tamil Nadu Vanigar Sangangalin Peravai organised a protest here on Tuesday against foreign products. These affect the domestic small-scale traders, says the Association president T. Vellaiyan. The Government should remove the ban on use of polythene covers in shops. These bags can be recycled. But the plastic used in packing products such as branded biscuits and snacks cannot be recycled. Yet, it is permitted, he says. Interestingly, poultry meat stall owners are offering Rs. 5 rebate for people who bring vessels to buy meat. Another stall has offered eggs free of cost to those who bring vessels. A few Tasmac outlets in the city on Tuesday opened the shops at noon and the tipplers were surprised to see glass tumblers in the place of plastic cups. A section of the tipplers also raised questions about how effective the washing of the glasses would be in these outlets. The Coimbatore District Roads Protection Association distributed pamphlets and cloth bags to more than 1,000 people near Thudiyalur bus stand to create awareness against use of plastics.|0|
Jewellery stolen|COIMBATORE|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Unidentified persons reportedly stole 10 sovereigns of jewellery from the house of Robinson Smart, a private college professor, at Karunya Nagar on Monday night, when he and his family members had gone to the church for New Year service. In another incident, burglars broke open the house of a lawyer and decamped with 20 sovereigns of jewellery when the family was away in Bengaluru.

Presenting the award, Governor Banwarilal Purohit said Ms. Sairam, who has had an illustrious career spanning decades could be credited with taking the art to a wider audience both in India and abroad. She was also known for her collaborative exercises in music with artistes of other countries, he said.

Four die in accidents during New Year celebrations|COIMBATORE|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|In spite of various measures initiated by the police to prevent accidents during New Year celebrations, four persons were killed in three separate accidents reported in Coimbatore city from the late hours of Monday to the early hours of Tuesday. In the accident that took place on Thadagam Road, two revellers were killed after their motorcycles collided head on. The deceased have been identified as A. Niyaz (19) from Gandhi Park, and K.

Textiles, clothing end year on a mixed note|COIMBATORE|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The textile and clothing industry have ended the year 2018 on a mixed note in both exports and the domestic markets, expecting a revival in 2019. “The year 2018 has been better than 2017, but not so good,” said Sanjay K. Jain, chairman, Confederation of Indian Textile Industry. International demand was largely muted because of the threat of U.S.-China trade war and uncertainties. The domestic market did not pick up as expected, especially during the last two to three months.  Exports stagnating After nearly four years of exports stagnating at about Rs. 37 billion, textile and clothing sector is looking forward to growth this financial year. Exports between April and November this fiscal grew 7% in rupee terms compared with the year-earlier period though the growth was almost nil in dollar terms. “This financial year, maybe we will cross it marginally. But, we need a push,” he said. India’s share in the global textile and clothing trade remains at 4%-5 %. It is all a matter of competitiveness. India’s competitiveness should improve, he added. Apparel exports so far this financial year is down 12 %. Annual apparel exports from India is nearly Rs. 17 billion, said A. Sakthivel, vice-chairman, Apparel Export Promotion Council, It is Rs. 34 billion from Bangladesh, Rs. 21 billion from Vietnam, and Rs. 11 billion from Cambodia. “These countries have duty free access to many markets. “We (apparel) are not able to give competitive prices in the international market. We have a price disadvantage. We are yet to come out of the GST effect. The rupee value fluctuation is also high. The government should consider increasing the ROSL (Rebate of State Levies) rate,” he says. The overall growth could be about 5% for the year ending March 2019, said Siddhartha Rajagopal, executive director, Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council. Cotton textile exports are expected to be up 8% to 10%. Usually, shipments during January-March are high. Export demand was good in patches this year. Indications are that international demand will pick up next year and this will have a positive impact on exports, he said. What is a matter of concern is increasing imports. Import of yarn, fabric and made-ups rose 13% in April-November this year, compared with the same period last year, Mr. Jain added. Imports are mainly in the man-made fibre segment and these come from countries such as China, Indonesia, and Korea. Production of textiles and apparel in the country rose between April and October this year as against the same period last year according to IIP data. There was negative growth in 2017 because of GST and demonetisation. The domestic demand picked up in the first six months in 2018 but slowed down after that, Mr. Jain added. With liquidity issues and stricter norms under Amended Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (ATUFS), investments have been slow. Margins are under stress and bank finance is difficult to come. The ATUFS norms should be relaxed and liquidity should improve for investments to revive in the sector, say industry sources.|0|

Youth kills father|CHENNAI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Nolambur police on Tuesday arrested a 19-year-old youth for allegedly pushing his father and causing his death. The police said Venkatesan, a painter, resided with his family in Mogappair West. On New Year’s eve, he advised his son Naveen Kumar, 19, not to go out with his friends. Without heeding his father’s advice, Naveen proceeded with his friends and returned home only at 1.30 a.m. Upon return, his parents scolded him for coming late. Naveen, in a fit of anger, pushed his father down. Mr. Venkatesan hit his head on the wall and an iron door, bleeding profusely. He died before reaching a private hospital nearby. His family tried to take his body to his native place in Arani for burial. In the meantime, the doctors informed the police. The Nolambur police rushed to the spot and arrested Naveen.|0|

Minister denies CPI leader’s claim|DINDIGUL|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|“I have never usurped any land belonging to any person and would never do such a thing,” Forest Minister Dindigul C. Srinivasan said here on Tuesday. Denying the allegation levelled against him by Communist Party of India (CPI) leader D. Pandian, the Minister said Mr. Pandian was trying to give a twist to a family dispute by unnecessarily dragging his name into the controversy and defaming him. “Mr. Pandian had alleged that I was using my official powers to attempt to usurp his four-acre land for my son-in-law...This is false and baseless,” Mr. Srinivasan said.|0|
Absence of alternatives to plastics worries consumers, traders|Erode|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Absence of alternatives to the banned plastic items has hit both the consumers and the traders as they were forced to bear the additional cost towards jute bags or other alternative products. Many shopkeepers and consumers said that though they were ready to cooperate for effective implementation of the ban, they point out that lack of easy availability of cost effective alternatives. There are little or no products available as alternatives for use and throwaway plastics. If available, the cost is a major factor, said V. Gunaseelan, a shopkeeper at Kollampalayam, who had advised customers to bring cloth bags. Eateries, provisional stores, tea shops depend on plastic covers and bags for packaging the products. Though they started using newspapers for packing, they said it is time consuming and less preferred by consumers. While hotels and shops selling chicken and mutton were asking their customers to bring their own containers, many shops started giving small discounts to consumers who bring their own containers or bags. Meanwhile, over 200 shops selling plastic items in the district had downed their shutters indefinitely opposing the ban on plastics. These shops, functioning at Kongalamman Kovil Street, Masjid Street, Krishna Theater Road and Indira Nagar in the city, and shops in other places in the district had displayed a message that their shops would be closed indefinitely. Members of the Erode District Plastic Manufacturers’ and Sellers’ Association said that there are 250 plastic manufacturing units and over 300 shops selling plastic materials in the district providing jobs to over 20,000 people. The ban on plastics led to them losing their jobs, they added. Members said that plastic ban had failed in most of the states and wanted the government to find a solution so that plastic waste does not mix with garbage.|0|
Awareness run|ERODE|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|To create awareness among the people asking them not to use the banned plastic items, over 200 workers of a private company at SIPCOT, Perundurai, took out a marathon run here on Tuesday.

Avaniapuram jallikattu: SC people allege discrimination|MADURAI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|A group of people belonging to Scheduled Caste (SC) communities petitioned Madurai Collector’s office on Monday alleging discrimination in the conduct of jallikattu in Avaniapuram village. The petitioners said that not a single person from any of the SC communities had been included in the organising committees formed in the village to organise the event. Pointing out that there was an issue going on between two committees over the right to organise jallikattu this year, S.P. Tamil Akilan, who belongs to the Arunthathiyar community, said that neither had any representatives from SC communities. “The committee consists of members from few dominant castes alone. In fact, we are demanding that all the 17 communities residing in the village must have representation,” he said. A. Sakthivel, belonging to Devendrakula Vellalar caste, said that the SC communities were residing in the village since time immemorial. “On the contrary, for some of the persons who are projecting themselves as leaders of the committee, Avaniapuram is not even their ancestral place,” he said. Peace meet Highlighting that a peace committee meeting organised at the Revenue Divisional Officer’s level to resolve the issue between the two committees failed, he said that a meeting planned at the Collector’s level must ensure that people from SC communities get representation. “All the SC communities are together in this fight. If there is no representation, we will not hesitate to approach the court or stage mass demonstration. We will not allow jallikattuto happen without our representation in the committee,” he added.|0|
New Year revelry witnesses no untoward incident|MADURAI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|With over 2,500 police officers and men deployed on all arterial roads and at important junctions, New Year revelry was on a regulated note without any overindulgence that caused inconvenience to the general public on Monday night. Police personnel were deployed at 66 identified junctions right from 6 p.m. as the revellers set out on motorbikes. As the night set in, more police personnel were seen moving around. Inspector General of Police (South Zone) K.P. Shanmuga Rajeswaran, who holds additional charge of Commissioner of Police, Madurai City, himself was making rounds in the city till the small hours of Tuesday, monitoring the celebrations across the city. “Our men were told that it was no law and order situation they were going to tackle. They were asked to ensure safety of the revellers, who were on their motorbikes, and also the general public who were out on the roads for celebrations,” he said. “It was an incident-free night where celebrations did not go overboard,” he added. Police parties were alerted to pick up those who were riding and driving in a rash manner. Those who were found to be riding bikes rashly were caught and made to sit under shamianas put up at four different parts of the city. “Our officers counselled them about the danger of speeding. We even offered them biscuits and water and let them go after making them sit and think for a few minutes,” Mr. Rajeswaran said. Those who were found drunk and riding were made to wait till some of their family members or friends came to take them home safely. “These initiatives worked as an effective deterrent. Instead of picking them up on New Year day for punitive action, we regulated their activity and educated them,” he said. A total of 19 cases for drunk driving/riding, 17 cases for speeding, 21 cases of triple-riding and five cases of cellphone riding were booked. In total, 1,117 cases were booked for various violations and Rs. 1.66 lakh fine was imposed on them. Meanwhile, a bicycle rider was run over by a lorry in the city on Monday night. The deceased, M. Pradeep Kumar, 55, of Anupanadi, was hit from behind by the lorry near Chintamani Railway Gate.|0|
Fairly good response on day one of plastic ban|MADURAI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|With the ban on use of single-use plastics coming into force on Tuesday, the district witnessed a fairly good response from the public, thanks to awareness programmes and enforcement over the last couple of months. As Madurai Corporation enforced the ban from December 10 itself, the public responded well in the city as witnessed during the large turnout for exchange of single-use plastics for reusable bags on Monday. However, the use of a few of the 14 banned items was still seen in some places, particularly in shops located in interior areas. “While many customers have begun to bring their own bags, some do not. Since I cannot lose business because of that, I still have plastic bags in my shop,” said a person running a grocery store in Vandiyur. Echoing similar thoughts, S. S. A. Basha, who runs a tea shop in Tahsildar Nagar, said that though he had switched to banana leaves for packing tiffin items, the difficulty was in packingchutneyandsambar. “Some people are selling silver-coloured plastic bags in the name of aluminium foil. However, officials say that they cannot be used,” he said. “Also, there is now high demand for banana leaves, because of which the prices are fluctuating. It is difficult to get them during auspicious days when marriages happen as the demand goes even higher,” he added. Collector S. Natarajan said that a total of 76 enforcement teams and 34 supervisory teams had been formed across the district to monitor and enforce the ban. “We have been fairly successful as there is increased awareness among the public,” he said. He added that in the initial phase the district administration would not prefer punitive measures. “We will only seize the goods if someone is found to be using the banned items at this stage,” he said.|0|
A forgotten British era relic|MADURAI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|In one’s anxiety to board a bus just leaving the Arapalayam bus stand, it is easy to lose sight of a precious piece of the past — the country’s one of the earliest water works of an urban local body. Sandwiched between the Vaigai Bund Road and Arapalayam Main Road, the defunct water pumping station, which was constructed in 1892, tenuously holds on to its past to add testimony to the city’s history. The British government began the process of providing piped water supply to south Madurai in 1804. To augment infrastructure, well were dug up and a pipeline network was established in the town, recalls Lokesh Sinram, an Environment Associate at Centre for Urban Water Resources. . British engineer J. A. Jones was the brain behind the Arapalayam Water Works (AWW). “The British were able to pump 30 lakh litres per hour through this system from the Vaigai and provide drinking water to the entire town that had one lakh population by the turn of the 20th century,” he says. Elaborating on the technical aspects, Mr. Lokesh says that a boiler was established in 1909 and a venturi meter to determine flow of water was installed between 1922 and 1930. “It is only here one can find three distinct spellings of the city, showing its evolution. Culverts established at different times inside AWW show ‘Madura’, ‘Mathurai’ and ‘Madurai’ as name of the city,” he says. The water works served for a good number of years until Madurai’s second pumping station in Arasaradi came into being in 1963. A Corporation Engineer working at Arasaradi says that AWW was shut down in 1980 due to excessive contamination of the Vaigai. With pollution and spread of diseases by 1975, Vaigai water was no longer potable, if supplied untreated. This led it its closure, he adds. A walk into the AWW shows that the structure is now uncared for. With extensive growth of shrubs and thorns both inside the building and outside the pumping station, people use the premises for defecation and urination. A heap of bottles is found lolling inside the pumping station. Old two-wheelers and and bicycles lie discarded and the building looks dilapidated, unkempt and rusty. Residents of the nearby say that a caretaker visits and cleans the premises about once in four months. The ancient building is often misused by miscreants and as a place to rest by wandering people. Only recently, its gates were locked, says a resident. M. P. Vasimalai, Executive Director, DHAN Foundation, calls for the protection of the water works. The government should declare it a monument. The AWW could be converted into a water museum and protected. Students can visit the place and understand Madurai’s water supply network in detail. It is located in a prime spot inside the city. It could be a great learning experience and we could protect a precious monument,” he says. Corporation Commissioner S. Aneesh Sekhar says that a project report has been submitted to the Tamil Nadu government for revival of the monument. He adds that it is awaiting approval.|0|
Power shutdown tomorrow|MADURAI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|There will be power shutdown in the following areas between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. on Thursday as the TANGEDCO plans to undertake maintenance work at its Valandur sub-station: Ayyanarkulam, Kuravakudi, Vinnakudi, Valandur, Nattarmangalam, Chellampatti, Ariyapatti, Sakkiliyankulam, Sochathevanpatti, Kuppanampatti and Pudupatti.|0|
CoP: technological support will help effective policing|Madurai|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Substantial increase in usage of technological support for policing is the need of the hour in the wake of increasing challenges and shortage of manpower in the police department, said Commissioner of Police S. Davidson Devasirvatham. Addressing at the 3rd executive committee meeting of Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry here on Tuesday, Mr. Devasirvatham said that the city was bound for further expansion. Stating that Thoppur where AIIMS is all set to come up and Madurai Airport are likely to come under Madurai city police limits, he said policing will become more challenging with increasing population and shortage of manpower. “We have proposed newer police stations with increased manpower. A new police station for Madurai Bench of Madras High Court has been sanctioned,” he said. Stating that most of the accused involved in criminal cases like robbery, chain snatching and murders were newer and younger persons, he said keeping a tab on all of them with physical presence of police was impossible. “Using of technology like fixing surveillance cameras will solve this problem,” he said. He said that the city police have planned to cover 150 identified junctions with closed-circuit television cameras. “Wherever such networks have been put up in recent times, residents were saying that crimes have come down,” he said. The police have decided to put up internet protocol cameras for the CCTV networks that would be linked with jurisdictional police stations for real-time monitoring and also for detection of crimes. “We intend to use facial recognition solutions that would alert the police about the movement of any criminal whose face is read by any camera. This will reduce the burden of physical policing,” he said. He said that with increasing salary burden for the Government, only technology will provide the solution in better policing. Senior president S. Rethinavelu, president, N. Jegadeesan, secretary J. Selvam, and Managing Director of TVS, Madurai, R. Haresh, were among those who were present.|0|
Demand for accountability in review of atrocity cases|MADURAI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Alleging that there were inefficiencies in conducting quarterly meeting of the Vigilance and Monitoring Committee of Scheduled Castes Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act in Madurai district, a few members of the committee had demanded that minutes of the meeting be maintained to ensure accountability. The committee, which functions in all the districts, is supposed to meet every quarter under the leadership of Collector to review the cases filed under SC ST (PoA) Act. The meeting will mainly focus on checking whether compensation was disbursed to the victims, and if due process was followed if a case filed under the act was being closed by the police as an instance of ‘Mistake of Fact.’ J. Balasubramaniam, a faculty member from Madurai Kamaraj University and a member of the committee, said that minutes of the meeting were not maintained despite multiple requests from the members for more than a year. “For instance, some cases that are closed as ‘Mistake of Fact’ are asked for reinvestigation by the Collector as the committee is not convinced by the explanation offered by the police. However, these are not recorded and tracked in subsequent meetings. No one knows what happens to these cases,” he said. Similarly, B. Pandiaraja, another member of the committee, said that another important issue was the disbursal of compensation to the victims. Disbursal of compensation “At any given point in time, there is a total backlog of more than Rs. 1 crore that is yet to be released to the victims. Though assurances are provided at every meeting by officials from the Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare (ADTW) department that the amount will be swiftly released, there is no effective tracking,” he said. Pointing out that the victims in some SC ST (PoA) cases are also eligible for job, pension and other benefits, he said that these points were rarely discussed in the meeting. “In many districts, the meetings do not even happen. The situation is relatively better in Madurai. We are only demanding better transparency and accountability,” Mr. Pandiaraja, added. Assurance by Collector When contacted, Collector S. Natarajan assured that the members were free to raise all issues at the meeting and full transparency and accountability would be ensured. “With respect to release of compensation, the funds have to come from ADTW department in Chennai. We are trying our best to disburse the amount without delay,” the Collector added.|0|

Restaurants charge customers extra for parcel|Krishnagiri|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Day one of the ban on the single use plastics was a big hit with public turning up in markets with cloth bags and garment shop bags on New Year Day. The shift from plastic covers to cloth bags may have been slow but steady in the run up to the end of 2018, says the manager of a department store in Krishnagiri. “Shops charged Rs. 5 and Rs. 3 on bags and it was just middle class economics that drove consumers into bringing their own bags,” says the manager. But, the ban was felt largely in restaurants, with long queues for food parcels. At the big restaurants, food parcels, especially meals turned out to be both time consuming and expensive in view of multiple packaging for food. Krishnamoorthy of RKV Residency in Krishnagiri said the implementation of the ban turned out to be smooth, except for the time taken to fill up plastic boxes. The tiny plastic boxes to fill up food parcels came with the tag of ‘oven use’ and therefore heat resistant. However, with the new plastic boxes, food parcels too have become expensive, on being billed Rs. 20 extra, said Mr. Krishnamoorthy. However, the real test of efficacy would be seen on Wednesday, when the plastic manufacturers have threatened to go on strike, says Mr. Krishnamoothy. “We managed on the first day, but when the strike kicks in, we will not have these plastic wares for packaging. This was sort of a trial run,” he says. However, the change of practices is already visible, among business establishments and consumers alike, both largely appreciating the ban on single use plastics.|0|

Empty plots become mosquito breeding spots|MADURAI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|People living by Anaiyur Main Road and in adjacent streets said accumulating garbage and small pools of stagnant water in vacant plots are turning mosquito breeding grounds. S. Yamini Devi, who owns an empty plot in Chelliah Nagar, said for several months now there had been a stark rise in mosquito population there. A steady stream of water entered her plot, causing water stagnation. “It leads to spread of several diseases,” she said. Residents of areas like Anand Nagar and Roja Street agreed to what she said. V.M. Raju, a resident of Anand Nagar, said additional wards of Madurai Corporation had always faced issues related to empty plots. “During rains earlier this year, Anaiyur became a favourite spot for mosquitoes. After the rains, residents were left swatting flies,” he says. L. Kanagapriya, a resident of Veeramamunivar Street, said empty plots in the vicinity had become dump yards for people, which led to breeding of mosquitoes. “We live next to an empty plot and often find people coming on bikes and dumping garbage here. We have complained to the local sanitary officers but they say garbage vigilance will be difficult,” she said. A Corporation engineer said Anaiyur had over 300 acres of empty plots of land, of which 150 acres belonged to Tamil Nadu Housing Board. To check mosquito breeding, fogging was done once a month. “We are going to different streets and spraying chemicals to control mosquito proliferation, but it has not yet had a significant impact. Health department will look into the issue,” he said.|0|

Parliamentary panel flags neglect of Western Ghats|Mumbai/Bengaluru|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Over 56,000 km of ecologically sensitive areas in the Western Ghats could not be earmarked as ‘no-go’ zones due to State governments’ ‘insensitivity’, a parliamentary panel has said. It urged the Union Environment and Forests Ministry to constitute a committee to address the issues and grievances of the local people. ‘Floods a warning’ The recent catastrophic monsoon floods in Kerala and parts of Karnataka should serve as alarm bells for administrations in the six States of Goa, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka that have failed to mark ecologically sensitive areas in the Western Ghats, the Committee on Government Assurances in the Rajya Sabha has stressed. Issues highlighted The Committee, which keeps track of assurances given by Ministers on the floor of the Upper House while replying to queries from parliamentarians, flagged these issues in its latest report presented on Monday. The panel had examined issues regarding the categorisation of Western Ghats parts as Ecologically Sensitive Areas (ESAs) as per the recommendations of two different committees led by Madhav Gadgil and K. Kasturirangan. “The Committee has observed that despite three draft notifications issued over four years for earmarking the ESAs, the six States could not be brought on board for action. As a result, over 56,000 sq km of ESA could not be earmarked as ‘no-go’ zones for polluting activities. Largescale de-forestation, mining and construction activities were continuing unabated, hurting the ecology of the Western Ghats,” its report said. “Insensitivity towards ecology of Western Ghats was making the six States of Western Ghats vulnerable to floods and landslides,” it noted. The report stressed that the recent monsoon floods should force the six States to earmark the ESAs. The committee examined 62 assurances during its deliberations with various State Governments and other organisations. It visited Pune, Mumbai, Chennai and Bengaluru, before finalising its report.|0|

Adherence to plastic ban monitored|Ramanathapuram|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Teams formed by the district administration to enforce and monitor the ban on certain plastic goods visited markets and monitored adherence to the ban. Two days ago, Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao formed 37 teams. Giving details of 14 plastic items covered in the ban, he advised officials to enforce the ban while educating the people on the evils of plastics. As plastics was part and parcel of lives of people all these years, it would be very difficult to discard them at once, he said and asked them to seize plastics wherever they were used. He formed two teams each for the four municipalities and 11 panchayat unions and one each for seven town panchayats in the district covering both urban and rural local bodies. Officials including those drawn from local bodies, revenue department, food safety department and the police visited various places and monitored the ban. They found many shopkeepers and vegetable or fruit vendors stopped giving plastic carry bags but insisted on people bringing cloth bags. As the ban applied to manufacturing units, wholesale and retailers of plastic items, stockists, traders, hoteliers, shop keepers and vendors, Mr Rao urged the public to refrain from using the 14 banned plastic items and cooperate with the government to free the state from the menace of plastics. Asserting that cleanliness begins at home, he urged the public to carry cloth bags when they buy vegetables and vessels when they buy meat or fish. Shop keepers should stop giving products in plastic carry bags. Thoothukudi A number of anti-plastic awareness activities were held in the district. Sports like silambam, skating and cultural events and rallies were held. A rally, flagged off by Corporation Commissioner Alby John Varghese, was held from the Cruz Fernandes statue to the Corporation office. Boxes were put up at places including the old bus stand where people could deposit polythene bags in return for cloth bags, which was welcomed by the public. Many shops were seen using banana leaves and newspapers instead of plastics.|0|
Intense contest on the cards in DMK stronghold of Tiruvarur|TIRUCHI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The byelection to the Tiruvarur Assembly constituency is expected to be an intense, multi-cornered contest as the ruling AIADMK and the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) are gearing up separately to mount a strong challenge to the DMK and end its dominance in the constituency. Former DMK leader and Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi had fortified his home turf by defeating his AIADMK rivals by huge margins of 50,249 and 68,366 votes in 2011 and 2016, respectively. Prior to that, when Tiruvarur was a reserved constituency, the party’s candidates had won the seat in consecutive elections in 1996, 2001 and 2006. The Communist Party of India (Marxist), which used to hold sway in the constituency, winning four elections between 1980 and 1991, is now in the DMK’s camp. The DMK had won here in 1971 and 1977 as well. Party president M.K. Stalin would be keen on starting the New Year on a winning note and, more importantly, repairing the damage the DMK had suffered in the wake of its defeat in the R.K. Nagar bypoll. Given the political significance of the byelection, former Minister and Tiruchi heavyweight K.N. Nehru was nominated as the election in-charge for the constituency. Mr. Nehru has already begun the spadework in Tiruvarur. The campaign would revolve around issues concerning agriculture, especially in the aftermath of Cyclone Gaja, and farmers’ agitations against the hydrocarbon exploration plans of the Centre and Karnataka’s move to build a dam across the Cauvery at Mekedatu. The Opposition would be looking to turn up the heat on the ruling party on these issues. But Food Minister R. Kamaraj, the lone AIADMK candidate to win from the district in 2016, asserted that the party would achieve a “historic victory” in the byelection. The people, he said, were aware that the State government still had three years left in its term, and could address the needs of the constituency.  Hoping for an encore With its support base in the Mannargudi belt, the AMMK is hoping for an encore of its performance in R.K. Nagar. “It will be a repeat of R.K. Nagar. The AIADMK will lose its deposit and the main fight will be between us and the DMK,” said S. Kamaraj, Tiruvarur district secretary of the AMMK. S. Kamaraj of the AMMK asserted that although Tiruvarur was known to be a DMK stronghold, the situation had changed after the death of its leader Karunanidhi. With a few other parties expected to enter the fray, the high-stakes battle could kick up much political heat and dust.|0|

Enforcement of plastic ban begins|Thoothukudi|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|After the ban on single-use plastics came into force on Tuesday, a number of anti-plastic awareness activities were held to herald the day by which the State had vowed to go plastic-free. Sports like silambam, skating and cultural events and awareness rallies were held. Besides the ban on 14 types of single-use plastics, which include plastic bags, dining table spreads, cups, spoons and cling films, Corporation officials including the Swachh police created awareness about the fact that polypropylene bags and aluminium foils should also not be used. Earlier, a local ban on single-use plastics was in force from August 15 onwards within Corporation limits, which had managed to wipe out most plastics. The State-wide ban seems to have given an impetus to the initiative. An awareness rally, flagged off by Corporation Commissioner Alby John Varghese, was held from the Cruz Fernandes statue to the Corporation office. Boxes were put up at places, including the old bus stand, where people could deposit polythene bags in return for cloth bags, which was welcomed by the public.

Thrust to micro irrigation systems in Tiruchi district|TIRUCHI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Agriculture department is seeking to give a push to micro irrigation systems in the district under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY). The district has been allotted Rs. 18 crore for 2017-18 and 2018-19 under the scheme. Small and marginal farmers are being given cent per cent subsidy for installing micro irrigation systems such as drip irrigation systems, sprinklers or rain guns depending on their requirement. Other farmers can avail 75% subsidy. While drip irrigation systems can be installed for crops such as sugarcane, cotton, maize or coconut, farmers can opt for sprinklers or rain guns for crops such as black gram, green gram or groundnut. The subsidy is to be extended for a total area of about 3,850 hectares in the district with allocation for two years. So far, nearly 40% of the allocation has been disbursed. Farmers can avail the scheme to conserve water, reduce labour costs and get better yield, Agriculture department officials said. Additional Director of Agriculture J. Vijayarani recently inspected the micro irrigation systems installed in a few fields in Pullampadi taluk in the district and interacted with farmers on the efficacy of the systems. She observed that the systems would help conserve water and help them get good yield. It would also bring down cost of labour as fertilizers could be applied through the system. The system would also help control weed growth as water was supplied directly to the roots. A.R. Periyakaruppan and Ravi, Deputy Directors of Agriculture, Mariya Ravi Jayakumar, Assistant Director of Agriculture, Pullampadi, and other officials were present.  The systems will help conserve water and help farmers get good yield J. Vijayarani Additional Director of Agriculture|0|

A sum of Rs. 17.6 crore has been sanctioned for executing the Uyyakondan River Development Project. N. Ravichandran, Commissioner-cum-Special Officer, Tiruchi Corporation, toldThe Hinduthat the project, which was to be implemented under the Smart City plan, was not only aimed at improving the beauty of the canal but also creating amenities for the people and children to have fun. About 2.8-km stretch along Uyyakondan Canal from Kuzhumayi Amman temple to MGR statue had been chosen for the riverfront development project. Besides laying of a new road, the river bund between the road and the canal would have provision for jogging and walking. Walkways and green space would be provided by improving retaining wall. Mr. Ravichandran said the stretch had been divided into four pockets. While two pockets would have children’s parks, one would have an open gym. It had been decided to create colour fountain in the fourth pocket. A paver block road with footpath was among the plan. Similarly, bio-fencing would be formed to prevent people throwing litter in the canal. Bio-fencing would also add value to the development plan. In addition to it, an open stage with amphitheatre would also be constructed on the left bank of the canal to conduct art and cultural shows. It would have a capacity to accommodate about 200 persons. The Commissioner said construction of an electronic toilet (e-toilet) was an important component of the riverfront development. It was a convergence of electronics, mechanical, web-mobile technologies thereby controlling entry, usage, cleaning and exit. It would act as a model in public health, hygiene and sanitation. It would be user-friendly. He said that inside park lighting would be an added attraction. As many as 300 solar lights would be provided in the park area. Arrangements had been made to provide road side lighting for 2.8 km. The works would commence within a few days. The contractor had been asked to complete the project within two years. The canal was controlled by the Public Works Department. It had given nod to carry out development works.  Uyyakondan River Development Project  Budget: Rs. 17.6 crore  Designation: Smart City Plan  Area: 2.8-km stretch from Kuzhumayi Amman Temple to MGR statue  Amenities: Walkways, children’s parks, open gym  Cultural facet: Amphitheatre with 200 seats  Attractions: 300 solar lights along park Completion: Two years|0|

DMK senior leaders urge Stalin to contest in Tiruvarur bypoll|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|A senior leader said though no decision was taken, they would meet Mr. Stalin again on Wednesday to place their request that he should enter the fray from Tiruvarur. Senior leaders, including party treasurer Duraimurugan, headquarters secretary T.R. Baalu and women’s wing leader Kanimozhi were closeted with Mr. Stalin for over an hour. Mr. Duraimurugan, when contacted, said, “We have not said anything about this. There is a party general council and other relevant bodies that would take a decision on who would be fielded in Tiruvarur.” The argument of the party leaders, who are in favour of Mr Stalin contesting in Tiruvarur, is that has he has nurtured the Kolathur constituency in such a way that it would be a cakewalk for the DMK candidate in the wake of a bypoll. “The senior leaders sought to prevail upon him that Tiruvarur is a prestigious constituency won by Karunanidhi with the highest margin. They felt Thalapathy (Mr. Stalin) will be the right candidate [to maintain the legacy],” said sources in the DMK, while admitting that Mr. Stalin had some “good candidates” in his mind for Tiruvarur. “We are not going to lose anything if he resigns from Kolathur. In Tiruvarur, the ground is totally in favour of us and his (Stalin’s) victory by a huge margin will galvanise the party for the Lok Sabha elections,” a leader argued. But a section of leaders rejected the idea saying that the DMK should not end up converting a bypoll into a high profile election.|0|

Wooing customers on New Year by selling vegetables at Rs. 1|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|A vegetable outlet here sold 15 kinds of vegetables up to 600g for Rs. 1 on the occasion of New Year. David George, who runs an outlet on Sarah Tucker College Road, said that vegetables, anywhere between 250-600g , including carrot, snake gourd, sweet potato, taro root and broad beans, were sold for just Rs. 1. He said that this would serve as an incentive for long-term customers. The event was also used to create anti-plastic awareness. “We did not sell vegetables to people carrying plastic bags, and requested them to bring cloth bags instead, to create awareness against plastics,” he said. Further a one kg salt packet was also given free. Around 130-140kg of vegetables were sold on th offer, he added. He plans to roll out similar offers on Independence Day and Gandhi Jayanthi as well.|0|

Scramble for alternatives to plastics begins|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|“We notice a strong awareness among the customers on plastic ban. Most of them brought cloth bags to buy commodities on the first day of the ban,” said M. Manikandan, a grocery trader at Cantonment in Tiruchi. In Kancheepuram, the district administration planned to step up the on-going awareness campaigns to highlight the impact of the non-recyclable, non-degradable plastic products on the environment. “This is so that the consumer is better informed and can help bring about the change,” said an official.

CRS nod for operation of Karur-Salem electrified stretch|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Commissioner of Railway Safety, Southern Circle, Bengaluru, has accorded statutory clearance for operation of electric loco-hauled freight and passenger trains in the newly electrified Karur-Salem broad gauge section. Consequent to the authorisation from the Commissioner of Railway Safety, Southern Railway officials propose to operate a goods train hauled by a electric loco in the 85-km electrified stretch soon. The Commissioner of Railway Safety carried out detailed inspection of the electrified stretch on December 27 and 28 accompanied by top Southern Railway officials and those from the Central Organisation for Railway Electrification (CORE), which executed the overhead electrification project. As part of his two-day inspection, the Commissioner of Railway Safety conducted a high-speed trial run from Karur to Salem on board a special train hauled by an electric locomotive. Senior railway officials toldThe Hinduon Tuesday that the Commissioner of Railway Safety gave mandatory clearance on December 31 for operation of electric-loc- hauled passenger and freight trains on the Karur-Salem energised section. Clearance has been given to operate trains at a maximum speed of 100 km/hour in the electrified section. To begin with, a freight train hauled by an electric locomotive will be operated in a day or two in the section, said an official. Passenger trains will be operated in due course by making neccessary arrangements for electric locomotives. CORE completed the overhead electrification project in a span of around eight months on the Karur-Salem stretch. It is the third major section to be electrified in this part of the region by CORE, which earlier electrified the 140-km Erode-Karur-Tiruchi and the 73-km Karur-Dindigul broad gauge sections. The entire cost for the three projects is over Rs. 300 crore. With the Namakkal traction sub-station constructed by CORE as part of the overhead electrification project yet to be commissioned, power supply is planned to be drawn from the traction sub station at Velliyanai. Officials hope that the traction sub-station works will get over by this month-end. The Karur-Salem stretch covers important stations such as Mohanur, Rasipuram and Namakkal en-route. The full potential of the electrified stretch will be realised once the Namakkal traction sub-station is commissioned. Officials say huge quantities of coal movement is taking place from the Karaikal Port to Mettur near Salem.|0|

City gets five ‘pink babies’|Bengaluru|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|On the last day of 2018, Lakshmi, 20, a Nepali felt searing pain and knew she would deliver her baby soon. She and her husband, Akash Buda, 21, also from Nepal, rushed to the BBMP maternity hospital at Tuvarekere, which was the only affordable option for the couple. Akash had migrated to the city five years ago and works as a watchman in BTM Layout. Less than an hour after the new year was ushered in, Lakshmi delivered a baby girl. The happiness of the couple’s first child was compounded when doctors and officials informed that their child would be among the first recipients of the Pink Baby scheme this year. “With the amount, at least our child can have a secure future,” says Mr. Buda. The scheme, conceived by the BBMP, will give Rs. 5 lakh to a girl child born in any of the civic body’s 24 hospitals in the first day of the year. The money comes in the form of a long-term fixed deposit. “The money will be put in an FD in the names of the parents. But control of the account will be with the local administrator whose permission is needed for withdrawal of funds. Money can only be withdrawn to pay for school and college fees, and will be directly transferred to the educational institution,” says Nirmala Buggi, Chief Health Officer (clinical), BBMP. The objective of the scheme was two-fold: increase patronage of BBMP maternity hospitals and encourage education of the girl child, she said. Though the scheme was announced last year, it has been tweaked to include a larger number of beneficiaries. In 2018, only the first child born in the city in a BBMP hospital was eligible. In 2019, the first girl child born in each hospital (that is, 24 hospitals in all) till March 31 will be eligible for the scheme. On Tuesday, five girls were the beneficiaries. Thirteen minutes after the Buda couple had their child, a girl was born to Udaykumar, a cab driver, and his wife Asha. They had rushed to the BBMP hospital at Ganganagar at midnight. “We have been coming to the BBMP hospital as it is affordable. We didn’t know about the scheme. It is a huge relief for us to know that her education will be taken care of,” said Mr. Udaykumar.|0|

Revival of steel flyover project on the cards?|Bengaluru|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The decision of the then State government to shelve the proposed steel flyover to Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) following an uproar was counted as one of the biggest victories of a citizens’ movement. However, the proposal appears to be getting a new lease of life this year. Deputy Chief Minister and Bengaluru Development Minister G. Parameshwara, on Tuesday, announced that the government is considering reviving the project on ‘popular demand’. The announcement comes in the backdrop of opposition to yet another project — the 102-km-long network of elevated corridors. “There is a serious problem of traffic congestion on the international airport road. Asteel flyover between Chalukya Circle and Esteem Mall is the need of the hour. There is a demand from the public to revive the project and ease traffic on the corridor. If a steel bridge is built, commuters can travel to KIA in 20 minutes. The previous Congress government had dropped the project due to political opposition. But we have decided to revive the project on popular demand,” Mr. Parameshwara told mediapersons. The announcement has taken civic activists who led the #SteelFlyoverBeda campaign, which eventually saw the government scrapping the Rs. 2,000 crore project in March 2017, by surprise. Srinivas Alavilli of Citizens for Bengaluru (CfB), an offshoot of the #SteelFlyoverBeda campaign, which is now leading a campaign against elevated corridors, found the Deputy CM citing ‘popular demand’ as ‘strange’ because the government had earlier scrapped the project owing to public opposition. CfB had taken up campaigns for public transport alternatives to solve congestion in the city. They are #ChukkuBukkuBeku demanding a suburban train network and #BusBhagyaBeku, demanding augmenting of the BMTC bus fleet. “But in the last two years, the government has not bought a single bus and is going at a snail’s pace on the suburban train network. They have frustrated citizens by not implementing public transport alternatives, and have again proposed flyovers for private transport as a solution – elevated corridors and steel flyover,” he said. CfB is in talks with several other citizens’ groups and will put up a united front against any mega infrastructure for private transport, he said. In 2016, the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) had claimed that 299 people had responded to public consultations over the project and most of them had supported it. However, a civic campaign mobilised nearly 42,000 people to vote against the project in a mock referendum. Urban expert Ashwin Mahesh said that the steel flyover had failed the test of both public opinion and expert opinion in 2016 and was deservedly scrapped. “The flyover will not solve the congestion on the international airport road and will add no value,” he said.|0|

Couple harassed post New Year revelry|Bengaluru|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|New Year revelry turned into a nightmare for a couple when two youths on a bike allegedly misbehaved with them before stealing a mobile phone in Richmond Town in the wee hours of Tuesday. The couple, both lecturers, had visited M.G. Road to witness the revelry and were returning home when the incident occurred. Based on their complaint, the Ashok Nagar police have taken a suspect into custody and are questioning him. The police said the incident happened around 2 a.m. near St. Joseph's College. The couple was heading towards Jayanagar from Residency Road. A duo on a bike were among those passing by, returning after the revelry on Brigade Roads and M.G. Road amidst cheers of ‘Happy New Year’. The pillion rider was standing and striking a pose from the movieTitanicwhen his hand brushed against the woman, who was riding pillion with her husband. The couple took objection, stopped the bike and questioned the duo. When a heated argument ensued, passers-by intervened. The husband's mobile phone was stolen while he was trying to click pictures of the unruly group gathered around them, the police said. The couple filed a complaint at Ashoknagar police station. The police have registered an FIR booking the accused under sections 341 (wrongful restraint), 354A (harassment outraging modesty of a woman), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace), 506 (criminal intimidation), and 379 (theft) of the IPC.

D.K. Shivakumar stresses on need to probe into allegations of horse-trading|Bengaluru|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Amidst the Congress and the BJP leaders sparring over the alleged attempts of the BJP to lure the Congress legislators, Water Resources Minister D.K. Shivakumar on Tuesday said that some kind of investigation is needed into it. Former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Sunday alleged that the BJP was attempting to lure Congress legislators by offering Rs. 25 crore to Rs. 30 crore each, a charge that BJP leaders have refuted. “There has to be some kind of investigation into the money transactions involved. I am not sure who will investigate this,” the Minister told presspersons here on Tuesday. Mr. Shivakumar said: “They (BJP) think that we are not aware of what is happening. We are aware of where, in Delhi or Mumbai or elsewhere, the meetings (alleged meetings of Congress legislators with BJP leaders) are taking place.” Taking a dig at BJP State president and Leader of Opposition B.S. Yeddyurappa, he said: “We have no issues with the dreams of Mr. Yeddyurappa. Let good things happen. We wish him all the best.” ‘Ask Yeddyurappa’ When asked about the whereabouts of former Minister and Congress leader from Belagavi Ramesh Jharkiholi, who is believed to be incommunicado for nearly 10 days now, he said: “Ask Mr. Yeddyurappa, he will know.” Meeting S.M. Krishna Meanwhile, Mr. Shivakumar also met his political mentor and former Chief Minister S.M. Krishna on Tuesday. Spiking any speculation attributing any political motive to the meeting, he said: “Mr. Krishna has given me political directions and has blessed me. I come to him to seek his blessings every year.” He also said that since the State was in the process of collecting opinions of former Chief Ministers on the issue of Mekedatu, Mr. Krishna’s opinion was also taken on Tuesday. “He was unable to come to the former Chief Ministers’ meeting. He has also worked on the Cauvery issue and has fought the issue through court.  There has to be some kind of investigation into the money transactions involved. I am not sure who will investigate this D.K. Shivakumar Water Resources Minister|0|
Police turn Santa Claus on New Year’s eve|Bengaluru|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|"Santa came late, delivering New Year’s gifts instead of Christmas gifts. The police, who decided to celebrate New Year in a unique way, donned the role of Santa Claus, returning stolen goods to the rightful owners at their doorstep. The valuables ranged from gold jewellery to electronic goods and even vehicles. Commissioner T. Suneel Kumar, who was part of the initiative, said, ""There is no greater joy that getting back stolen property, that too when the police visit your doorstep to deliver your hard-earned valuables."" Annamalai K., DCP South, said that the initiative was aimed at connecting with the people, as well as instilling a sense of confidence in them, while also expressing commitment from the police. ""We returned around three kg of gold valuables from 18 cases of house break thefts detected in the past one-and-a-half months. We also ensured that the victims got back their lost valuables without any running around,” he said. The initiative was met with mixed reactions with some people thinking it was a prank. Many became emotional and thanked the police for the gesture. “One of the victims who had lost a scooter gifted by her husband began to cry as soon as we knocked on her door and handed over the key. The family had no words to express their gratitude when the police officer wished them happy new year,” an officer said. Ravi D. Channannavar, DCP West, said the initiative would assure people that the police are here to protect and take care of them. “Over a kg of gold valuables was handed over to as many as 18 rightful owners, along with a bouquet and a sapling,” he said. One of the victims, who lives in the USA, was shocked when the police returned his stolen valuables in Kengeri. He said the gesture had changed his perception of the police, who are often subjected to criticism, an officer said. The Whitefield police too received similar responses from six persons who received stolen valuables at their doorstep. “A series of house breaks happened last year in K.R. Puram. In one of the places, we obtained a fingerprint and zeroed in on Ramesh, a habitual offender from KGF, and recovered over half-a-kg of gold valuables, which were returned to the rightful owners,” said Abdul Ahad, DCP, Whitefield."|0|
BJP central leaders ‘enter the fray’ to woo disgruntled Cong. legislators|BENGALURU|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The seven-month-old Janata Dal(S)-Congress coalition government appears to be set for a tough challenge with the the BJP central leaders reportedly entering the scene this time to woo disgruntled Congress legislators in a bid to topple the government. According to sources in the BJP, the party central leaders had remained “observers” during the previous attempt to topple the coalition government, which did not succeed. However, this time, they are directly monitoring the situation. It may be noted that the moves of some disgruntled Congress legislators, who are upset over not getting berths after the recent ministerial expansion, has caused concern in the ruling coalition. Some of these MLAs, including industrialist and senior leader Ramesh Jarkiholi, who was dropped as Minister, are said to be in touch with the BJP central leaders in New Delhi. Sources said that the BJP leaders are taking time over this as they want to execute the process in a discreet manner. “After the earlier embarrassment when the party State leaders made a mess of the situation by failing in their mission after almost going public in their efforts to topple the government, the central leadership is treading cautiously on the issue,” a senior BJP leader said. The BJP State leaders are of the view that it will take about 10 days for their central leadership to come out with a decisive action. “Perhaps visible action may start some time soon after Sankranti festival (January 15),” a BJP State leader said. It is learnt that the BJP central leadership has entered the scene as it feels that the continuation of the coalition government may dent the party’s Lok Sabha poll prospects in its southern base of Karnataka. Sources said that the BJP is keen to bring down the government before the presentation of the next State budget by Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy as the coalition government is expected to use it to create goodwill ahead of the Lok Sabha polls by announcing various new programmes. At the same time, sources made it clear that the BJP central leadership may even silently wriggle out of the scene if the things do not go its way. The BJP leaders admit that bringing down the coalition government is not an easy task as at least 13 MLAs would have to tender resignation if the present dispensation has to lose majority.  Help from the top The State BJP leaders expect central leaders to begin decisive action in about 10 days, or soon after Sankranti Central leaders are reportedly going slow as they do not want to mess up the situation They may withdraw from the situation if things do not work in their favour|0|
Teens grill ISRO chief in first space Samwad|Bengaluru|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|What was the first career choice of the chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation? How can youngsters contribute to the nation's space programme? How does the space agency cope with failures? These were some of the posers for K.Sivan, ISRO Chairman and Secretary, Department of Space, from high school pupils in the city on Tuesday. They also sought his advice on their own career options. For over three hours, 40 pupils and 10 teachers from select schools got a close look at the national space programme, satellites, rockets, Chandrayaan and the future Gaganyaan at ISRO headquarters in Bengaluru. The event was part of the new Samwad with Students (SwS) that ISRO launched for schools and colleges as part of its extended public outreach to engage and fire up young minds, a release said. Dr. Sivan told them, “Your boundless energy and endless curiosity are going to be my biggest source of inspiration and motivation. With so many challenging missions on hand this year, I thought it is important to seek the good wishes of students who are the future of this country. Whenever we are short of ideas or inspiration, we will look for you. We will be ever ready to answer your questions related to India’s space missions.” Answering a Class 10 student about handling failures, Dr. Sivan said the biggest lessons in life are often learnt when plans go awry. “Space missions are very complex in nature. [We] take failures in our stride and take on the challenges with a positive mindset,” he said. Dr. Sivan advised them to take up science and mathematics. He told another student, “Complete your studies with focus on fundamentals of science, get back to us and help us solve our problems. You could be giving us answers to many of our problems.”|0|

Self-assessment must for lecturers|Bengaluru|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|It is now mandatory for college lecturers to undertake a self-assessment test from this academic year. The Department of Collegiate Education, last month, issued an order stating that it was compulsory for lecturers from all 412 government first grade degree colleges to undertake these tests. The order states that academic audits will have to be undertaken in April every year. Officials said that self-assessment would also help teachers reflect on their strengths and weaknesses. “It will help them identify areas of improvement and how the classes can be improved,” said a senior official from the DCE. Besides self-assessment, the department also seeks feedback from students on the performance of their lecturers. The self-assessment exercise, which is mandatory, requires lecturers to fill a detailed form with 35 questions. These include details of the paper they are teaching, the workload they have every week, preparation of teaching material, and use of teaching aid. Besides this, it also asks lecturers to key in the assignments given to students as well as the seminars and field visits conducted for the students. Lecturers also have to submit details on the trainings, research and professional development programmes they have undertaken. It also asks lecturers to write down the additional responsibilities they have undertaken in college and seeks feedback about the viability of the student strength, with the intention of addressing the challenges they face. H. Prakash, president, Karnataka Government College Teachers’ Association, said the assessment would help develop accountability among lecturers. “It will also develop healthy competition among the lecturers. This positive reinforcement will boost the morale of the lecturers and break monotony. It will help lecturers who are slacking pull up their socks,” he said.|0|

According to doctors, the seer has been showing signs of recovery. “However, we will have to wait and watch for the next two weeks as a lung infection at his age is of concern,” said Ravindra B.S., chief of medical gastroenterology at BGS Gleneagles Global Hospital in Bengaluru. The seer had successfully undergone liver bypass and gall bladder removal surgery on December 8 in Chennai. “Although there are no other complications post surgery, his protein levels have depleted.

On December 9 , during a routine inspection, officials had found a ‘honeycomb formation’ on the beam. On December 12, the BMRCL started preliminary maintenance work by erecting a supporting structure and decided to operate trains at a slower speed. Ajay Seth, MD, BMRCL said the problem of ‘honeycomb formation’ (concrete distress) on a beam on pillar number 155 had been fixed, and trains had started running as per the regular schedule.  Safety audit plan The BMRCL is gearing up for a safety audit of the entire 42-km Phase I. Mr. Seth said, “A lot of planning has to be done before taking up the safety audit. A plan is likely to be ready by January-end. It may require up to five months to complete the audit.”|0|
BJP warning|Bengaluru|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Leader of opposition in the legislative assembly B.S. Yeddyurappa cautioned against the government steamrolling the project. Water Resources Minister D.K. Shivakumar shot back saying the government cannot be ‘blackmailed’ over development by the opposition and they would implement the project in the interest of the people. “During the previous government, Siddaramaiah respected their views and dropped the project. If I were to be in his place, I wouldn’t have done so. The opposition sees red in every development project, but that can’t deter us,” he said.|0|
‘Local, social issues should be debated at literary fest’|DHARWAD|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The 84th All-India Kannada Sahitya Sammelan should explore ways of creating awareness and achieving progress through literature, said district in-charge Minister R.V. Deshpande on Tuesday. Speaking to presspersons after inspecting the arrangements made for the mega literary event at the University of Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad (UAS-D), he said the sammelan should not end up as just another event. Instead, the government expects experts and resource persons taking part in various technical sessions to deliberate upon issues troubling the nation and suggest corrective measures. To a query, Mr. Deshpande reiterated that the government was committed to providing all help, including financial support, for the smooth conduct of the event. “Once the government gave its approval to go ahead, it was our duty to abide by our words. The government has already released Rs. 8 crore for this purpose, and it will reimburse all the expenses on the sammelan,” he said. Mr. Deshpande expressed satisfaction with the arrangements at the sammelan venue here. He inspected the facilities provided to house book stalls, the kitchen, and dining hall, and and instructed officials to ensure there is be no confusion. Holiday The Deputy Commissioner has issued orders declaring holiday on January 4 and 5 for all educational institutions in the district.

To provide education that liberates people|MANGALURU|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Prakash Anchan, his brother Purushottam Anchan are on a mission. The two, who are part of Durga Friends Club that is providing English-medium education in the Government Higher Primary Upgraded School in Daddalkadu near Bantwal here, want to do the same for other schools in the State. “It is the dream of the poor to get quality English-medium education for their children. We are striving to help them realise their dream,” said Prakash Achan, who runs a cloth store in Bantwal. The Anchan Brothers were part of a delegation of Government Shaale Ulisi Belisi Rajya Samiti that recently met Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy in Belagavi and sought permission to start English-medium education in 1,000 government schools. “We have around 1 lakh members in the samiti. We are confident of implementing the Daddalkadu school model and revive government schools,” Mr. Purushottam said and added, “We follow the principle of social reformer Narayana Guru who believed in providing education that liberates people. We want to adopt best teaching practices in government schools,” Mr. Purushottam said. Poverty made Purushottam, Prakash and Shekar Anchan to leave their education midway and earn a livelihood through a cloth store. They formed Durga Friends Club through which a series of repair works of government schools were taken up. It was during the repair work at the Daddalkadu school in August 2016 that the school’s headmaster told Mr. Prakash Anchan of the prospect of the closure of the school as the student strength had come down to 30. The three brothers and other other members of the club decided to remove their children from private schools and enrol them at the Daddalkadu school. “Within 24 hours, the strength of the school went up to 57,” Mr. Prakash said. The club went to the High Court of Karnataka to obtain a judicial order for free supply of textbooks to the school. The strength of students from LKG to Class 8 was 500, Mr. Prakash said. The club constructed eight classrooms last year. This year, they have constructed a new block of 16 classrooms, which will be inaugurated by Governor Vajubhai Vala on January 5.|0|

It will be a sahitya sammelan of records and firsts: Manu Baligar|HUBBALLI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The 84th All-India Kannada Sahitya Sammelan is set to create records in terms of registration of delegates and number of sessions held, according to Kannada Sahitya Parishat president Manu Baligar on Tuesday. Speaking to presspersons after watching a rehearsal for the performance ofnaadageethe(State anthem) by students of SJMVS College for Women here, he said that a record number of sessions — 24 — would be held at the Dharwad sammelan. “For the first time, there willbe a special session on issues related to north Karnataka. The border issue, Mahadayi, irrigation projects, and farming will be dealt with in various sessions,” he said. With regard to registration of delegates, the parishat had to stop registrations as the number had reached 16,500 — the highest in the history of Kannada Sahitya Sammelans, he said. While 500 stalls have been allotted for books and other publications, 300 are allotted for commercial use. Mr. Baligar said there would be special counters for women at the food section and enclosures and facilities for women with newborns. State anthem Mr. Baligar said the Parishat had proposed to the government to issue an order restricting the singing time ofNaada Geetheto two minutes and 30 seconds, and this would be done during the convention. The proposal was sent after consultations with experts, including writers and musicians, as the State anthem is usually sung like a song and can sometimes last up to nine minutes, he said. As many as 25 students of SJMVS College are being trained by their teacher, Jyothilaxmi, to sing the anthem within the stipulated time, Mr. Baligar said. To a query, Mr. Baligar clarified that the Kannada Sahitya Parishat had alreadyopposed the government decision to introduce English as medium of instruction. He added that the Chief Minister has promised to convene a meeting of experts and writers to discuss the matter. “We are hopeful that the CM will convene the meeting after the sahitya sammelan,” he said.

After much delay, new court complex becomes functional in Hubballi|HUBBALLI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Four-and-a-half months after the then Chief Justice of India Deepak Mishra inaugurated the new court complex in Hubballi, it became functional on the first day of the New Year on Tuesday. Although the new court complex has all the facilities, there was delay in making it functional as no government agency was fixed for the maintenance of the fully air-conditioned multi-storeyed building. The new court complex was built at a cost of Rs. 122 crore on Hosur-Unkal Link Road in Vidyanagar, Hubballi, and the issue of who has to bear the annual maintenance cost delayed making the courts functional. The annual maintenance cost of the building, including electricity bill and data connectivity, is around Rs. 5 crore. The issue has been sorted out now with the Judicial Department consenting to foot the electricity and data charges and the Public Works Department deciding to take up the responsibility of building maintenance. Consequently, workers were deployed to shift the court documents on Saturday and they worked day and night to make the necessary arrangements to make the courts functional. On Tuesday, Principal District and Sessions Judge Ishappa Bhute performed puja to symbolise the new court complex becoming functional. Subsequently, he inaugurated the auditorium of the Hubballi Bar Association and the women advocates wing on the new court complex premises. The new complex premises has 16 court rooms. Admitting that technical issues had delayed the start of the new court complex, Mr. Bhute said all the courts would become fully functional now. He told presspersons that committees would be formed to ensure that the court complex was maintained properly. He said that there were 142 washrooms in the court complex and to ensure that they were properly maintained, a monitoring team consisting of judges, advocates and officials would be formed soon. He said that the road adjoining the court complex was being widened and it would help in handling the huge inflow of vehicles to the area. After the formal inauguration, Mr. Bhute and other judges, judicial officers and office-bearers of the Bar Association, including its president Ashok Baligar, inspected the facilities.

MNREGA slows down seasonal migration|Kalaburagi|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Mehabub Jamadar, who migrated from Honna Kiranagi village in Kalaburagi district to Mumbai and worked as a construction labourer for nearly 20 years, returned to his native a few weeks ago. This, after hearing that work was now available under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA). Three members of his family work under the job scheme too. “The cost of living in Mumbai is so high that I’m happy to stay back here if I get work throughout the year,” he told this reporter at the MNREGA work site on the outskirts of the village. He was among the labourers at Honna Kiranagi engaged in constructing twin tanks — first tanks of their village — on government land. Saibanna, another rural labourer in the same village who was working as a construction labourer in Bengaluru for the last 15 years, also returned to the village to work under the job scheme this year. “Even though I got Rs. 600 a day in Bengaluru, I could hardly save anything because of the high cost of living. We earn less than half under the job scheme here, but we are happier as the cost of living is much lower and we are with family,” he said. For many marginal and small farmers and farm labourers in Kalaburagi villages, seasonal migration had been a yearly phenomenon. Soon after the harvesting of toor in December and January, families migrate to bigger cities in search of jobs. They work as construction labourers there for six months and come back to the village by June when agricultural activities begin. What reversed the trend this year was that MNREGA work commenced here before the toor harvest was over. “We have received 1,460 applications seeking work and job cards have been issued to 800 people. The rest will come soon after the remaining toor harvest is completed,” Sadashiva, a field assistant of the job scheme in Honna Kiranagi village toldThe Hindu. “We had taken up the MNREGA issue as a campaign and Anirudh Sravan P., when he was the CEO of Kalaburagi Zilla Panchayat, responded to it by putting it on top priority,” said K. Neela, State vice-president of Janawadi Mahila Sanghatan, who has been mobilising rural labourers under MNREGA. “In villages where the job scheme is effectively being implemented this year, the migration is under check especially in Aland, Chincholi, Afzalpur, and Kalaburagi taluks,” she said. Raja P., CEO of Kalaburagi Zilla Panchayat, said that MNREGA works had been commenced in most of the villages and around 25,000 people were working on an average across the district every day. “MNREGA is our top priority and we use it as a means to check migration. We have started the work in most villages and four lakh man-days have already been generated,” he said. Irregular wages Though people are happy with the availability of work, they are upset about the irregular payment as well as the number of working days presently offered under the scheme. “Wages are supposed to be paid on a weekly basis. But, we are not paid even after three weeks. All our commitments such as clearing dues at local grocery stores are on a weekly basis. We find it difficult to manage if we don’t get wages every week as we live hand to mouth,” a labourer said, adding that the yearly workdays should be increased to 200 days. Mr. Raja attributed the delayed payment to lack of coordination between the Centre and State in releasing funds.  The cost of living in Mumbai is so high that I’m happy to stay back here if I get work throughout the year.Mehabub JamadarA labourer who worked in Mumbai for nearly 20 years  Even though I got Rs. 600 a day in Bengaluru, I could hardly save anything.

‘Poornakumbha’ procession to stay|HUBBALLI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Putting to rest the debate on whether ‘poornakumbha’ procession by women should be held on the inaugural day of the 84th Akhila Bharath Kannada Sahitya Sammelan, president of Kannada Sahitya Parishat Manu Baligar said it would be taken out through voluntary participation. Speaking to presspersons here on Tuesday, Mr. Baligar clarified that almost all Kannada literary conventions had the ‘poornakumbha’ procession and as arrangements had already been made, it would be held during the Dharwad convention. He further said it would be open for all, including widows, transgenders and even men if they wanted to carry the ‘poornakumbha’.

District administration promises to curb fish waste water discharge|Mangaluru|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|"The Dakshina Kannada district administration has promised to alleviate the woes of the public from the menace of waste water spillage from fish-transporting vehicles and foul smell emanating from vehicles transporting decayed fishto fish meal factories. While people have been suffering silently from this problem for years, the phone-in programme initiated by former Mangaluru City Police Commissioner M. Chandra Sekar about four years ago had provided them a platform to air their grievances. Following complaints about this, the police took action and booked cases against erring vehicles many times. But years later, similar complaints still pour in during the phone-in programme, now being continued by Commissioner T.R. Suresh. Mangaluru fishing harbour is a major source of fish procurement. Activist Nemu Kottary wondered why such activities continue despite the police having all the power to rein in nuisance-makers. Mr. Kottary said the menace was pronounced only in the Karnataka coast, as both Goa and Kerala have imposed severe restrictions on this. Besides emanating foul smell, the waste water on the road can become fatal to road users, particularly two-wheeler riders. What is more, sometimes the spilt water falls on other road users, he said. Of late, decayed fish being transported in small goods vehicles from Bunder to Ullal too have added to the trouble as roads stink for long time as and when such vehicles pass through. According to Manjunath, a resident of Jeppu, there has been some improvement in things. Because of police action, containerised fish-transporting trucks have stopped opening waste water tanks en route. The issue is with small pick-up vans, which either do not have tanks or let the taps remain open throughout the ride, he said. Responding to a senior police officer’s claim that local bodies should have provided a place to dump waste water, Mr. Manjunath said if the police tighten the screw, fish transporters could force local bodies to provide discharge spots. Deputy Commissioner S. Sasikanth Senthil toldThe Hinduthat he was aware of the problem. “We will discuss the matter and enforce [the rules],"" he said. The administration might even invoke executive magisterial powers to curb the menace, if needed, he added."|0|

‘Hand over land records to bagair hukum cultivators’|Yadgir|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Socialist Unity Centre of India (Communist) and Raita Krishikarmika Sanghatane have urged the State government to hand over revenue records to farmers cultivating on bagair hukum land for the past several decades. Addressing a meeting in Yadgir on Tuesday, Somsekhar and Sharanagowda Gugal said that the government had agreed to hand over land records to cultivators before March 31, 2019, while accepting a particular set of documents to complete the formalities. Therefore, government should fulfil the promise and hand over land records within the time stipulated, they said. They also warned that they would launch an agitation against the government, if the latter did not hand over land records to farmers. D. Umadevi, Ramalingappa, Subhashchandra, Siddappa, Khaja Moinuddin, Mahesh and farmers from various parts of the district were present.|0|
40 MLD more of drinking water for Mysuru soon|MYSURU|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The quantum of drinking water available for Mysuru city is expected to go up soon, easing distribution, thanks to a project taken up under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) for enhancing the capacity at Melapura and Hongalli water pumping stations. This is likely to yield 40 million litres per day (MLD) more. As of now, 180 MLD is sourced daily from the pumping stations for distribution across 65 wards. According to the MCC, 67 MLD is sourced from Melapura station and around 60 MLD from the Kabini project. The remaining is sourced from Hongalli 2nd Stage (32 MLD) and 3rd Stage (50 MLD), Belagola (45 MLD), and borewells (3 MLD). MCC Commissioner K.H. Jagadish said there was a loss of about 15% of water in transmission from source to distribution points. Besides, there have been cases of pilferage and leakage as well, which are being looked at. But the pumping stations can together pump 250 MLD. Under the AMRUT scheme, a sum of Rs. 156 crore is being spent on boosting pumping capacity, deploying heavy–duty pumps, and relaying distribution pipes at the stations. Around 30 MLD more of water from Kabini and 13 MLD from Cauvery is expected thanks to the project, he added. “We are hoping to get the works done in the next three months, expediting the project,” the Commissioner said.|0|
Artists paint pothole-dotted roads, distribute cucumbers|Mandya|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Commuters on some congested roads in the town received twin surprises on Tuesday. They got alerts about the crater-like potholes some distance ahead on the road that they were travelling, and cucumbers for lending ears to alerts that could save their lives. Pothole woes are not new to Mandya. The condition of some busy roads in the town has worsened and it is not advisable to drive/ride even at a speed of 10 kmph on them. Even the Bengaluru-Mysuru highway in the town has many potholes. To draw attention of Mandya City Municipal Council (CMC) or other agencies concerned towards the pathetic condition of roads, a team of enthusiastic artists from the town staged a novel protest on Tuesday. Equipped with paints, brush and other materials, they visited many roads and marked the potholes with varieties of paints. While some potholes were encircled with white paint, many were marked with arrow/anchor symbols to caution the motorists. There are several hundreds of potholes on roads in the towns and they have been left unattended since long, said Prakash, social activist and an artist, who conceptualised the protest. According to a team member, their protest will continue till the civic authorities launch a pothole filling drive. Riders skidding and falling on roads, in their attempts to avoid potholes, are common. The road users are also suffering from back pain, an artist said. The agitating artists issued cucumbers to the commuters, who stopped and expressed their support to the protest. When contacted, an officer at the CMC said: “We will take measures to fill the potholes.”|1|Tuesday

Suvarna criticises State govt. for not taking issue seriously|UDUPI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Yashpal Suvarna, chairman of the Dakshina Kannada and Udupi Districts Cooperative Fish Marketing Federation, on Tuesday criticised the State government for not taking seriously the matter of the missing fishing boat from Malpe, Suvarna Tribhuja. In a press release issued here, Mr. Suvarna said that it was 18 days now after the boat went missing, but neither the State government nor the Fisheries Minister Venkatrao Nadagouda or the Udupi district in-charge Minister Jaimala, had called any meeting to discuss the matter with the fishermen of Malpe Fisheries Harbour. By ignoring this incident, the State government had neglected the interests of 45 lakh fishermen divided into 39 sub-castes, who resided across the State. After the boat went missing, young fishermen were not keen on venturing into sea for fishing. This was having an impact on the economy of the coastal districts, where fisheries played a vital role. Hence, it was incumbent on the State government to respond immediately to this issue, and to trace and ensure the safe return of the seven missing fishermen. If the government failed to take quick action in the matter, the fishermen would go to Bengaluru and lay a siege to the Vidhana Soudha. Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy and Mr. Nadagouda should understand the seriousness of the situation and take immediate action, Mr. Suvarna reiterated.|0|
Water dues in Mysuru hit Rs. 162 crore|MYSURU|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Drinking water dues have touched a whopping Rs. 162 crore in Mysuru city, and government departments and corporations are among the defaulters, together owing Rs. 27.17 crore to Mysuru City Corporation (MCC), which has resolved to step up the drive to recover dues. Gram panchayats owe Rs. 15 crore. The MCC is hoping to recover at least Rs. 10 crore dues a month, starting this year, to drum up its revenue for carrying out development works. Dues on domestic connections stand at Rs. 105 crore, while it is Rs. 18.94 crore on non-domestic connections. The MCC is owed Rs. 7.58 crore on commercial connections and Rs. 4.97 crore on industrial connections. The MCC, unlike electricitysupply companies, does not follow the system of disconnecting supply in case of non-payment of dues. This has resulted in a steep rise in water dues to the corporation. The civic body is targeting recovering all the dues by May this year. It has proposed a scheme of waiving interest on dues (subject to consent from the government). But the MCC has no plans of going for disconnection. MCC Commissioner K.H. Jagadish told reporters here on Tuesday that recovery of water dues is being taken up and a target of Rs. 10 crore set for January. He said that many government departments and agencies owe Rs. 27 crore, and MCC officials were individually approaching the heads of such departments and urging them to clear the dues in one go. According to him, Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation owes Rs. 1.51 crore, the Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply Corporation (CESC) owes Rs. 85.83 lakh, the Railways Rs. 69.99 lakh, and the Education Department Rs. 2.75 crore. Among the other defaulters are the departments of Public Works (Rs. 53.61 lakh), Health and Family Welfare (Rs. 73.77 lakh), Medical Education (Rs. 50.11 lakh), ATI (Rs. 20.91 lakh), Police (Rs. 3.03 crore), Karnataka Exhibition Authority (Rs. 5.09 lakh), KEB Jyothinagar (Rs. 58.87 lakh), and Mysore Urban Development Authority (1.78 lakh). These dues were calculated up to November last year, according to the MCC.  ‘Don’t waste water’ The MCC has urged residents not to waste river water and go for conservation to ensure there is no crisis in the summer. “We are not anticipating any crisis in the summer, taking into account water storage at the source,” the Commissioner said. Mayor Pushpalatha Jagannath urged residents to avoid wasting water for cleaning and washing floors. She added that caretakers of parks have been asked to use only borewell water for watering lawns and plants. She said residents can call the MCC helpline (0821-2411366) to report issues pertaining to water supply, including complaints against those wasting water.|0|

Eerie similarity with 2013 breakout|Kochi|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The fire at the Brahmapuram solid waste treatment plant on Tuesday had an eerie similarity with a fire breakout there in 2013. Almost six years down the line, it was plastic waste that caught fire yet again drawing comparisons between the two incidents similar in nature and scale. Incidentally, in 2013, it was the third major fire at the plastic dumping yard of the corporation in as many as four years. Investigations into that incident had failed to crack the mystery behind the blaze. No mechanism However, S. Shanawas, the then Muvattupuzha Revenue Divisional Officer, who conducted the investigation, was critical of the corporation and the absence of a fire-fighting mechanism at the plant site. That holds true even now. The report, which was submitted to the District Collector, pointed out that there was no evidence to prove that plastic heaps were deliberately set on fire. The argument that the garbage might have accidentally caught fire gained strength in the absence of the evidence to prove otherwise. The Ambalamedu police, which also looked into the incident, could not gather any evidence to prove allegations that the waste was set ablaze, the report said.|0|
Not enough water to slake city’s thirst|KOCHI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The city’s thirst for water is rising steadily with 1,000-odd new connections added to the distribution network annually. Officials of the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) say that as of now, the demand-supply gap of 70 million litres a day (mld) for piped water supply is just about manageable as they apportion the available water to different parts of the city. However, with the existing infrastructure for generation of potable water, the city would be unable to meet the demand, going by the rate at which the number of connections is increasing under each sub-division. Therefore, it is important that the city’s water supply is augmented with the proposed 180 mld plant at Kalamassery. The demand-supply gap generally goes up in summer, which is just about a month away. The city, on an average, gets 220-240 mld of water from the Aluva and Maradu treatment plants. The Aluva plant generates water at 280-290 mld, above its capacity of 225 mld. The city gets about 140 mld, after meeting the demands of the municipalities of Aluva, Eloor, Kalamassery and nearby panchayats. Officials of the KWA believe that the city will require an additional 140 mld as a futuristic measure as there is an increase in the resident population, increasing influx of the floating population and more commercial requirements. More bulk demand is expected with more apartments coming up. A flat complex is considered a “bulk consumer” as water is provided to the complex as a single unit, linked to the supply line with a bigger pipe. “An increase in the floating population of the city by about 10% and the increasing trade, commerce and industrial activities have added to the demand,” says an executive engineer.|0|
LS poll: Gowda seeks 10 or 11 seats|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|His statement is significant in that sources had been indicating that the Congress was willing to offer only 6 or 7 seats to the JD(S) and Mr. Gowda’s party was asking for more.

Attacks Modi Mr. Gowda also attacked the Narendra Modi government stance on agrarian issues and the Prime Minister’s remarks on the farm loan waiver announced by the Kumaraswamy government, in a recent booth-level interaction with BJP workers from Karnataka. “If he [Prime Minister] has not realised even after seeing the biggest demonstration in Maharashtra, where his party is in power, then people will take note of his callousness,” Mr. Gowda said. Stating that no government had survived by neglecting farmers, Mr. Gowda said: “If political parties neglect the farming community, farmers will teach them a lesson.” Hitting back at Mr. Modi on his comment on poor implementation of Karnataka’s farm loan waiver, Mr. Gowda said: “He made a sarcastic remark, making fun of the Karnataka government. Not less than 60,000 farmers have benefited so far. About Rs. 350 crore has already been paid to them electronically into their bank accounts.” ‘Transparent manner’ All eligible farmers would be benefited under the scheme, he said, and added that the Janata Dal (S)-Congress coalition government in Karnataka was implementing the loan waiver scheme in a “transparent” manner.|0|

Vellappally hits out at upper castes|Alappuzha|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Those who are hitting the street in the name of saving rituals and customs are only interested in protecting their authority over temples, Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP) Yogam general secretary Vellappally Natesan has said. He was speaking to reporters here on Tuesday. “As much as 94% of the temples in Kerala are under the custody of the upper caste. They now fear that they will lose their authority over the temples. If a person from a backward community is appointed as priest in a temple, he is forced to work as cook. This situation should change. The women’s wall is a good initiative in that direction and will help bring the necessary change,” Mr. Natesan said.|0|
Monkey fever outbreak likely to hit tourism prospects of Sharavathi valley|Shivamogga|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The outbreak of Kyasanur Forest Disease (KDF), also known as monkey fever, at Sharavathi river valley in Sagar taluk is likely to dent the tourism prospects of the region.

Coffee blossoms early in Wayanad|KALPETTA|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Untimely blossoming of coffee plants owing to erratic rain during the harvesting season has put farmers — who are already struggling with the slash in prices of Robusta coffee and low production — in the Wayanad district in a fix. Coffee plants have bloomed in major coffee cultivating areas in the district and harvest would have to be extended to nearly a fortnight owing to this, farming sources said. 30% blooming “Nearly 30% blooming is reported following the erratic shower in many parts of the district a few days ago,” M. Karuthamani, Deputy Director, Coffee Board (Extension) Kerala, toldThe Hindu. “If the plants get a backup shower in a fortnight, it will help the farming community get a good harvest next year,” he said. Usually, the coffee plants would bloom if they got a rainfall of 20 cm. But backup showers were needed in two weeks’ time to support bean formation after pollination, Mr. Karuthamani added. According to Wayanad Coffee Growers Association (WCGA) president Prasanth Rajesh, the erratic rain in the midst of harvesting added to the worries of the farmers. Spikes had been formed after the rain, resulting in coffee blooming in different stages. It would not only delay bean picking this season, but also hamper regular picking operation next year, he said. Workers would have to be engaged for nearly seven more days by providing menial jobs and paying high wages, Mr. Rajesh added. Crop loss Farming sources said there was nearly 20-25% crop loss in Wayanad during the season, a major Robusta coffee growing area in the State, owing to the heavy rain last year. Heavy rain also triggered diseases such as black rot disease, berry dropping due to fungal infections and melee bugs, besides affecting production. According to the data available with the Coffee Board, coffee cultivation is spread over 84,931 ha in the State, of which 67,366 ha is in Wayanad.|0|
State may have to redraw CZMP now|Kochi|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|After the laborious preparation of the Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP), which will influence development activities in coastal districts, coastal States, including Kerala, may now have to redraw the document following the notification of a new Coastal Regulation Zone approved by the Centre. The Central government last week approved the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) notification, 2018 when the CZMP prepared by Kerala was awaiting approval. The preparation of the CZMP, which once approved, will dictate the development patterns along the coast, was a long-drawn affair and it took several nudging from the National Green Tribunal and the Supreme Court for the States to prepare the document. The Kerala document took almost three years to be prepared after a series of deliberations involving stakeholders, including coastal ecosystem management specialists, builders, fishermen, and coastal communities. The National Centre for Earth Science Studies, Thiruvananthapuram, was assigned the task of preparing the document. The public hearing organised on the draft document had witnessed unruly scenes and protests in some districts. The CRZ 2018 notification, said Veena Madhavan, member secretary of the Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority, was approved soon after the State submitted the CZMP for its 10 coastal districts. After the CRZ notification, 2018, being published as a gazette notification, Kerala may have to revise the document, she said. She said the procedures to be followed for the revision would be known only when the gazette notification was published. There would also be a guideline for the States to follow. At the same time, experts involved in the preparation of the earlier CZMP said Kerala may have to introduce changes in the CRZ 3 A category, which deals with panchayats having population density of 2,161 per sq km. According to available information, the No Development Zone (NDZ) has been reduced to 50 metres from the High Tide Line against the earlier 200 metres in CRZ 3 A, permitting more constructions towards the seaward side. The NDZ has also been reduced for backwater islands in CRZ 3, which also have to be reflected in the CZMP, said K.K. Ramachandran, former member secretary of the authority. There may not be any changes in the CRZ categories 1, 2 and 4, he added.|0|
Fighting shoulder to shoulder to uphold renaissance values|Kochi|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Resolving to take forward the spirit of renaissance movement and the fight for gender equality, hundreds of women joined the human wall along the NH 544 that runs through the city. Women from the district joined the wall along the national highway stretch between Pongam and Aroor. M.C.

Wishing New Year with flowers|IDUKKI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The plantation town of Munnar practically turned a town of flowers on Tuesday, the first day of the new year. Enticing the tourists, who arrived at the hill station on the eve of Christmas/New Year, was the delicious display of flowers lining roads and streets. The town’s transformation for a day is part of a tradition kept alive from the days of the British Raj when plantation workers gave flower garlands to the senior staff of the plantations, people’s representatives, people they respect, and shopkeepers. The workers are in return given a ‘kaineettam’ or a gift of cash, which would be in accordance with the quality or the price of the garlands. Belief It kindled the belief that if a ‘kaineetam’ was received from a respected person, there would be prosperity in their family throughout the year. The tradition is still being followed without a break. So on the day before the New Year Day, flower shops would occupy the roadside. There would be flowers brought from Tamil Nadu too. The New Year flower vendors mostly arrived from Usilampatti, Andipatti, Madurai, Dindigul Nilakottai and Hosur. Favourite flowers The favourite flowers for making the string are chrysanthemum, marigold, jasmine rose, chendumalli, pichi, oleander and thulasi. However, the jasmine garlands are most preferred among the buyers. In the Munnar flower market, the price of jasmine flower per kilogram reached over Rs. 2,000 on Tuesday from Rs. 1,600 on Sunday. “The flower garlands are gifted to affirm relationships with the senior staff,” said a plantation employee. It was also used as an occasion to bury the hatchets and make a new beginning. There was also a tradition of gifting fruits and getting the ‘kaineettam,’ he added.  Plantation workers give flower garlands to senior staff of plantations, and in return they are given a ‘kaineettam.’|0|
Prakash Raj to contest LS polls|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The actor in the past had supported the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) of K.

New Year revelry catching on|Mysuru|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Public gathering for the New Year celebration, which was conspicuous by its absence in Mysuru all these years, is now gaining ground with the palace emerging as the focal point. New Year revelry all these years was confined to youngsters or families gathering at clubs, hotels or resorts. There was no mass gathering in public places. However, it changed when the district administration and the Mysuru palace board introduced cultural programmes lasting till midnight followed by fireworks for the first time on December 31, 2016. It proved to be popular and a similar programme was held the next year that saw a huge turnout. But the public participation exceeded all expectations when people in thousands gathered at the palace premises to soak in the cultural programmes till midnight followed by display of fireworks on Monday to bid adieu to 2018 and ring in 2019. Bulbs light up night sky The drastic dip in night temperature did not deter people from gathering in front of the Jayamartanda Gate of the palace from 11 p.m. to soak in the beauty of the illuminated palace and the fireworks. At the stroke of the midnight hour, nearly 100,000 bulbs lit up the palace to signal the onset of the New Year while fireworks lit up the sky even as people wished and greeted each other. The crackers were lit from the adjoining Doddakere Maidan grounds which was located at a considerable distance besides being at a lower level. This was a let down for the crowd which had gathered to watch the fireworks in the backdrop of the illuminated palace. Sources in the palace board said there were certain issues – administrative and technical – which forced the decision and hoped to shift the location it back to the palace again from next year. “We are aware that fireworks in the sky above the dazzling palace makes for a spectacular sight matching similar iconic images of fireworks that is beamed from across the world during New Year and will ensure that the fireworks are brought back to the palace from next year’’, said the official.|0|
Women form a fortress against gender inequality|KANNUR|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The district saw a huge turnout of women to form the women’s wall along the 82-km stretch of the National Highway here on Tuesday afternoon. Men too assembled in equally large numbers on the other side of the road to support the pledge to strengthen the values of renaissance and gender equality.

NH widening talks hit a roadblock|Kochi|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Talks held between the District Collector and representatives of the NH Samara Samiti, which is on the warpath opposing a second round of land acquisition between Edappally and Moothakunnam to widen NH 66 (formerly NH 17), ended in a stalemate on Tuesday. Members of around 1,000 families and traders have been on the warpath for about a decade demanding that a six-lane NH be built on the 30-metre-wide land that was acquired from them over two decades ago. They also sought the construction of an elevated road to further decongest the stretch if needed, to prevent a second round of eviction in the name of widening the national highway to 45 metre. A press release by the Samiti said that no consensus could be reached on 11 points where differences persisted between them and government agencies on land acquisition, the quantum of compensation, etc. The notification to acquire land was issued on the basis of the land acquisition Act of 1956, whereas land owners have been promised compensation under the new Act of 2013, said Hashim Chendampilly of the Samiti. The compensation package for acquiring land on either side of the 163-km-long Edappally-Kozhikode stretch is meagre. Moreover, an elevated highway can be built in the Edappally-Moothakunnam portion using the compensation amount as per the new Act, he added. MLA clarifies Responding to this, V.D. Satheesan, MLA, who also attended the meeting, said that compensation will be given as per the new Act of 2013. “This was clarified by the District Collector. Thus, landowners will get market rate for land and buildings and up to 120% solatium. We are not competent to comment on the demand for an elevated highway. Our aim is to ensure that landowners and traders get maximum compensation,” he said. Mr. Satheesan added that the State government is expected to take up with the Centre issues like compensation sought by traders who were functioning from rented premises. The Collector was unavailable for comment. Over 150 people who opposed the survey for widening the stretch to 45 metrehad been arrested by the police on Monday and released on bail.|0|

Implied consent Allowing the petition filed by the teacher, Justice Raja Vijayaraghavan observed that courts had taken a view that when a student was sent by his parent or guardian to a school, “the parent or guardian must be deemed to have given an implied consent to the child being under the discipline and control of the school authorities and to the infliction of such reasonable punishment as may be necessary for the purposes of school discipline or for correcting him”. However, the nature and gravity of the corporal punishment inflicted by a teacher would determine whether he/she could be proceeded under the penal provisions. Not to be condoned “If the teacher, out of unbridled fury, excitement or rage, inflicts injuries which are of such a nature as to cause unreasonable physical suffering or harm to the child, the same cannot be condoned on any ground or on the principle of express or implied consent,” the court added. The judge also pointed out that a school teacher, in view of his peculiar position, had the authority to enforce discipline and correct a pupil. The courts had also taken the view that it could be assumed that when a parent entrusted a child to a teacher, he/she on his/her behalf impliedly consents for the teacher to exercise such authority over the student. Peculiar position The position of a teacher vis-a-vis a student was peculiar in nature and only when he inflicted such harm which was unreasonable and immoderate that he/she would be liable to be proceeded against in a criminal court. Mathematics The petitioner contended that he was in the process of teaching the child the nuances of mathematics and to make her alert, he jabbed on her shoulders. The act could not be said to be one motivated by malice, the petitioner contended.  The gravity of the corporal punishment will determine whether the teacher could be proceeded under penal provisions.|0|
Nearly 900 revellers may lose their driving licences|Kochi|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Having celebrated the New Year in high ‘spirits’, the mood of nearly 900 revellers is set to turn sour as they stare at potential suspension of their driving licences after being booked for drunk driving. Sudden spurt Like in the previous years, incidents of drunk driving clocked a sudden spurt in the days leading up to the New Year as statistics from rural and city police limits seem to suggest. Fortunately, there was no major accident during the period. In three days starting from December 29, the 31 police stations within Ernakulam rural limits registered 652 cases, including the 353 cases registered on the New Year eve and in the early hours of the New Year alone, while 21 city police stations registered over 200 cases invoking IPC Section 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way) and Section 185 (driving by a drunken person or by a person under the influence of drugs) of the Motor Vehicles Act. Based on available statistics, Muvattupuzha led the list with 46 cases closely followed by Perumbavoor - 45 cases. While Angamaly and Kothamangalam registered 40 cases, and Piravom saw 38 cases. Compared to rural areas, instances of drunk driving were far less within the city limits. The Maradu police that registered 21 cases topped the list followed by North and Cheranalloor police with 20 and 15 cases respectively. Fewer cases Interestingly, Fort Kochi, the hub of New Year revelry, accounted for only three such cases in as many days, which the police said was due to their focus on maintaining overall security. “We could have registered plenty of cases if we had the luxury of focusing on drunk drivers alone,” Fort Kochi police sources said. In most cases, the police are likely to recommend suspension of driving licences of offenders to the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD). MVD, on its part, will hold a hearing of the offenders followed by the suspension of licences for periods ranging from six months to a year depending on the gravity and frequency of the offence. In other cases, offenders will be made to pay a fine of Rs. 2,000. Rahul R. Nair, District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural) said certainty of punishment and a much higher fine alone will serve as a deterrent against drunk driving. He also felt that MVD needs to be stricter with such cases.|0|
Kanjikuzhy block panchayat to be made child-friendly|Alappuzha|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Kanjikuzhy block panchayat will launch a project to make it a child-friendly place. The project is aimed at ensuring the welfare and safety of children up to 18 years. It will cover the grama panchayats of Thanneermukkom, Kanjikuzhy, Mararikulam North, Cherthala South, and Kadakkarappally under the block panchayat. “Our aim is to declare the block panchayat a child-friendly place. We have already drawn up a project map and will start implementing it from the start of the next fiscal,” said a panchayat official. A survey will be carried out at the panchayat level as part of executing the project. “It will collect details of children at the ward level. This will help us create a database of the children at the block level. We will then categorise the children into different groups. The first category will include children up to five years, the second category will cover the 6-10 age group, the third category will include children in the age group of 11-15 age-group, and the last category will cover those in the age group of 16-18 years. This way, we can organise awareness classes and special programmes based on the needs of different age groups,” said an official As part of the project, steps will be taken to make schools and homes in the local body child-friendly. “Measures will be taken to encourage good habits, inculcate agricultural skills and cultural values among the children. They will be given opportunities to nourish their skills. Besides focusing on children, awareness programmes will be organised for their parents. Grama sabhas consisting of children will be convened to discuss the project. Further, committees will be set up at ward, panchayat and block levels for monitoring the implementation of the project,” the official added.|0|

SHRC launches suo motu probe|KOTTAYAM|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Kerala State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) has launched a suo motu probe into the incident in which 25 people from six families sought asylum in a parish church fearing attack from a group of alleged Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) activists. In an order on Tuesday, SHRC chairman Antony Dominic directed the District Police Chief, Kottayam, and the District Collector to probe the episode and submit reports. The incident pertained to an attack on a carol group including women and children near Pathamuttom on December 23. During the attack, the accused pelted stones at the carol group members. Arrested Similar attempts were also made on the St. Paul’s Anglican Church at Kumbadi where the victims had been camping since the incident. Seven youths have been arrested in connection with the case while five persons are yet to be arrested. Even nine days after the incident, the victims remain stuck inside the church and have been unable to return to their homes allegedly owing to a social boycott imposed by a political outfit. Adding to their concerns on safety, all the seven accused under custody have been released on bail. Though two police men have been posted on duty at the church, there have been reports about outsiders monitoring the movement of vehicles entering and leaving the church premises.|0|
Hashish brought from Tamil Nadu?|Kochi|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|When the Kochi City Shadow Police nabbed a four-member gang linked to a Hong Kong-based international drug cartel with hashish worth crores on Monday, it was the fruition of months-long, hard-nosed intelligence work. Ever since a group linked to the same cartel slipped through the net a couple of months ago, the Shadow team had been on their trail. This time around, sleuths had the group in their sight the moment they landed here on December 27. Initially, the team picked up Anthonisamy, who according to the Shadow Police, is a seasoned carrier from Tamil Nadu, and traced the other three based on his revelations. Anthonisamy, who holds a Maldivian visa and works as a cab driver there, was found to have travelled between Maldives and various South Indian airports 12 times in 2018 alone. “He was tempted by the cartel with money for carrying drugs during his trips to and from home,” A.B. Vibin, Sub Inspector, Kochi City Shadow Police, toldThe Hindu. Major destination Though the cartel reportedly smuggles high quality hashish oil to the entire South East Asia, Maldives, a tourist hub with numerous resorts, remains its major destination. The contraband seized from Kochi was also bound for Maldives. Shifa Ebrahim, one of the four accused, has been identified as the lynchpin of the drug movement. “An employee at Maldives airport, he makes necessary arrangements for the consignments to pass through undetected,” said Mr. Vibin. Though preliminary evidence suggests that the hashish oil originated from Tamil Nadu, it is yet to be confirmed. The accused, being professionals, hardly revealed anything about the source of the contraband or their operations before they were remanded on Tuesday. For the time being, the police are verifying their call details to trace back their operations before seeking their custody shortly for detailed interrogation.|0|
Over 200 check reports issued|Kochi|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Speeding motorists and those found travelling in heavily altered vehicles were among the offenders intercepted by the Motor Vehicles Department in a drive aimed at keeping New Year celebrations in check and preventing accidents. The drive led by Deputy Transport Commissioner Shaji Joseph and Enforcement Regional Transport Officer Manoj Kumar and involving over 60 officials lasted into the early hours of Tuesday. Multiple squads deployed by splitting the district into Ernakulam and Kochi regions prepared 200-odd check reports for a variety of offences including usage of illegal headlights. Owners of altered vehicles were asked to produce them after restoring to their original conditions. Officials also played Good Samaritans in places where minor accidents were reported., said Biju Isaac, Motor Vehicle Inspector.|0|
Britto’s body to be donated to MCH|KOCHI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The body of CPI(M) leader Simon Britto, who had represented the Anglo Indian community in the Kerala Assembly, will be donated to the Government Medical College, Ernakulam, on Wednesday. “The body of the late leader is being brought to his residence at Vaduthala tonight (Tuesday). It will be kept at his home and at the Town Hall for the public to pay homage on Wednesday before being handed over to the medical college at 3 p.m.,” P. Rajeev, State secretariat member, CPI(M), said. Britto, who died on Monday, had led his life on a wheelchair as a paraplegic after being a victim of violence on the Maharaja’s College campus. Donation of cadavers Donation of cadavers for study by medical students has been rare in the past, owing mainly to lack of awareness and cultural taboos. However, the situation now is better with medical colleges in the State receiving more cadavers than 10 years ago. The Government Medical College, Ernakulam, has 20 cadavers now - most of them either pledged by the donors or brought by their kin heeding the wish of the donor. In medical education, the proportion for cadaver to student is 1:10 -- a group of 10 medical students should be conducting their studies on one human body. But, that does not happen in many medical colleges, though the situation in government medical colleges is better. In Ernakulam, a group of 20 students studies one body, because of the shortage of cadavers. In other government medical colleges, there are about 30 to 40 human bodies at a time. There was a time when cadavers for anatomical studies were really short, said Dr. M.B. Prasanna, head of anatomy department in the Government Medical College, Ernakulam.|0|
Fire breaks out at garbage plant|Kochi|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Mountains of garbage, including plastic, dumped at the solid waste treatment plant of the Kochi Corporation at Brahmapuram caught fire, creating pandemonium in the area on Tuesday around 3.30 p.m. Fifteen units of fire tenders and firefighters from nine fire stations had to toil for about four hours to bring the fire under control that had spread over large swathes within the plant premises by then. The fire was eventually doused around 7.30 p.m. Thick plumes of black smoke with a penchant smell billowed from the plastic heaps, causing breathlessness even to the firefighters who had a tough time manoeuvring their way through garbage heaps. Rubbish from flood-hit areas dumped in the plant made the situation worse. Earth movers were brought in to remove the burning junk to create space for firefighters to position themselves for spraying water over waste mounds. Fire tenders were replenished with water from the nearby Kadamprayar. “The reason for the fire is not known though the possibility of dumped bottles with chemicals, like body spray, among the garbage heaps catching fire under a hot sun could not be ruled out,” P. Dileepan, Regional Fire Officer, toldThe Hindu.Mayor Soumini Jain said that a probe would be launched to detect the reason for the fire and to know whether someone was behind it. She said a huge ball of fire had formed by the time it was detected giving the impression that multiple heaps of garbage caught fire and merged. “Fire force units and corporation officials will be deployed overnight at the plant since plastic keeps simmering even after the fire has been put out, risking another bout of fire,” she said. District Collector K. Mohammed Y. Safirulla and top revenue officials rushed to the area to supervise firefighting operations.|0|
Pokkali rice is going places|Kochi|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Not many Malayalis may have heard about pokkali, but Kerala’s very own indigenous rice variety is inspiring scientists the world over to develop new rice cultivars in an effort to build resilience against climate change. Several teams of researchers have turned to pokkali to study how the indigenous rice variety, which is traditionally cultivated only in the districts of Ernakulam, Thrissur and Alappuzha, is able to thrive in naturally-occurring saline coastal paddy fields. A team, including scientists from New Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), has found through a series of experiments conducted over six years that the high expression of a specific gene – OsIF – stabilizes the plant’s photosynthetic machinery in high salinity conditions, thereby playing a crucial role in pokkali’s tolerance to salty conditions. ‘Transgenic’ rice The team developed a new rice variety by moving this single gene from pokkali to IR64 (a high-yielding variety cultivated in more than 200 countries). They found that this resulting ‘transgenic’ or modified rice was even more tolerant to salty conditions and high temperatures than pokkali itself. “Pokkali has an excellent gene pool which is very useful for salinity tolerance,” said Professor Ashwani Pareek of JNU, co-author of the study published inScientific Reports, who has been studying the genetic basis of pokkali’s impressive salinity tolerance for the past two decades. In his laboratory, at least a dozen unique genes from pokkali have been identified and characterised for stress tolerance. Kochi’s Rice Research Station (RRS) also created a similar variety in 2015 by moving another portion of pokkali’s DNA (named Saltol QTL, which has also been shown to aid the plant’s salt tolerance) into Jyothi, one of the State’s popular rice breeds. Named Jyotsna and released officially less than a year ago after successful field trials in 2017, the new variety is now being distributed to farmers, said Shylaraj K.S., Director of the RRS. Useful traits On an average, pokkali fields yield only around one-and-a-half tonnes per hectare, she said. “While pokkali’s best yields are up to four tonnes per hectare, Jyotsna easily produces up to six tonnes in good soil conditions,” she said. Several foreign research institutes, including the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines, have also been studying pokkali’s gene pools and has identified a portion of DNA on one of its chromosomes that is crucial for salt tolerance, said Dr. Pareek. With pokkali also being tolerant to submergence in water for a week, it does have numerous useful traits, said Dr. Shylaraj. As a result, farmers reported that pokkali fields in Kadamakkudy and Varapuzha were relatively unaffected by the floods that ravaged paddy fields where other short rice varieties were cultivated, she said. Need for conservation In a recent review of Kerala’s indigenous rice varieties published in the journalCurrent Science, scientists at Chennai’s M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation argue that given the wide range of such adaptations of these indigenous rice varieties as well as their ability to thrive under harsh climatic conditions, conserving them is critical in promoting climate-resilient agriculture. “Unpredictable monsoons and higher temperatures are fallouts of climate change and we need high-yielding varieties that can trump over these,” said Dr. Pareek.  Unpredictable monsoons and higher temperatures are fallouts of climate change and we need high-yielding varieties that can trump over these Dr. Ashwani Pareek|0|
Massive turnout for women’s wall|Kozhikode|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Braving the afternoon sun, thousands of women lined the national highway from Vaidarangadi to Azhiyur in the district on Tuesday to link up with the women’s wall and take a pledge to preserve the spirit of Kerala social renaissance. The wall of women on the 76-km NH stretch in the district from 4 p.m. to 4.30 p.m. saw the participation of over three lakh people. However, a CPI(M) leader claimed the participation of six lakh women. People from Wayanad also joined the programme. As many as 30,000 people from Wayanad led by CPI(M) legislator C.K. Saseendran took part in the five-km stretch on the Wayanad road in the district. Ministers T.P. Ramakrishnan and A.K . Saseendran coordinated the State-wide programme in the district. No untoward incident was reported from anywhere in the district even as police put in place tight security arrangements. Specially arranged vehicles ensured that the participants reached their designated spots on the highway. The State government had earlier carried out massive campaigns including rallies, marathons and flash mobs, contests for women at taluk, municipality and grama panchayat levels for the D-day. About two lakh women under the Kudumbasree Mission were part of the wall formation, besides members of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) workers, representatives of various women’s organisations, voluntary agencies, NGOs, and women from different walks of life. Writers P. Valsala, C.S. Chandrika, Khadeeja Mumtaz, B.M. Suhara, Arya Gopi and K.P. Sudheera and social activist K. Ajitha took part in the programme. All India Democratic Women’ s Association State secretary P. Sathidevi read out the pledge near Muthalakulam Maidan in city. Similar functions were also organised at Koyilandy and Vadakara.|0|
Tension in Kasaragod|Special Correspondent|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|A tense situation prevailed near Kanhangad following an attempt to disrupt the women’s wall on Tuesday. The police used canes and teargas to disperse people who attempted to upset the campaign. The police said the tension arose when a large number of people, allegedly Bharatiya Janata Party workers, assembled on the rail track at Chettukundu under the Bekal police station limits and set fire to dry grass along the track to prevent people crossing it to reach the National Highway just 20 metres east of the track. They pelted stones at the police when they tried to disperse them. The police used canes and burst teargas shells to disperse the troublemakers. According to the police, several police personnel were injured in the stone pelting. Many women who reached the area to join the wall fled. Chettukundu is a BJP-dominant area. The situation in the area was tense even after the end of the campaign. A large posse of police personnel were deployed in the area in view of the tension. In Kasaragod district, Health Minister K.K. Shylaja read out the renaissance pledge for the participants of the campaign.|0|
Congress to move court against DDE|Kozhikode|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Congress activists took out a march to the office of the Deputy Director of Education (DDE) and staged a dharna there on Tuesday in protest against the half-day off declared for schools in the district on the day, which they claimed, was to help mobilise people for the government-backed women’s wall. However, E.K. Suresh Kumar, DDE, was not present at the office when the dharna was staged. Opening the dharna, District Congress Committee president T. Siddique accused the DDE of trying to show off his political loyalty to appease the organisers of the women’s wall. School students in Kozhikode district had already lost around 17 working days in this academic year owing to the Nipah outbreak and the floods and teachers were working overtime to compensate for the loss. The DDE, who was supposed to help teachers and students, had shown lack of responsibility by declaring a day-off on Tuesday and later correcting it to half-day off, he said. Mr. Siddique said the Congress would launch a political agitation against Mr. Suresh Kumar and also approach the court seeking legal action against him. Earlier, the protesters had a minor scuffle with the police personnel present outside the DDE office when they tried to barge into the officials’ cabin. There was some confusion among parents, teachers and students when the DDE initially declared a day-off on Tuesday. Later, the DDE informed through the Information and Public Relations Department that classes would be held only till the afternoon. Bus services cancelled Meanwhile, with many private buses cancelling afternoon services on Tuesday on account of the women’s wall event, hundreds of commuters were left in the lurch. Many buses were booked for participants of the women’s wall. As a few bus operators also chose to suspend services mid-way in the afternoon anticipating a traffic block, many women and children had a tough time reaching home. Though the Education Department had declared half-day off for school students, they could not get buses to go home and had to depend on autorickshaws.|1|Tuesday

CM should confine himself to State affairs: NSS chief|KOTTAYAM|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Denouncement of the government’s moves in Sabarimala, implementation of the S.R. Sinhu Commission recommendations, and inclusion of holiday on Mannathu Padmanabhan’s birth anniversary under the Negotiable Instruments Act were the core resolutions adopted by the Akhila Kerala Nair Prathinidhi Sammelan at Perunna here on Tuesday. The resolution on Sabarimala, presented by Nair Service Society (NSS) general secretary G.Sukumaran Nair, stated that the government and the Travancore Devaswom Board failed to stand by the devotees. It also termed the women’s wall as a government attempt to sabotage the custom at Sabarimala. The resolution accused the government of attempting to hastily implement the Supreme Court verdict allowing women of all ages to Sabarimala. The resolution on the Sinhu commission sought to uphold Mannathu Padmanabhan’s stance on a fundamental change in the reservation system to ensure social justice to all sections of society. It noted that implementation of the panel’s recommendations would ensure that the benefits of government’s affirmative action reached the financially backward sections among the upper castes. The third resolution sought to include the holiday on January 2, the birth anniversary of NSS founder Mannathu Padmanabhan, under the Negotiable Instruments Act to enable more people attend his memorial services at the NSS headquarters. Welcoming the gathering as part of the 142nd Mannam Jayanti celebrations, Mr. Nair minced no words in attacking the Left Democratic Front government and its leaders, including Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. “The Chief Minister should confine himself to affairs of the State leaving the issues of the Nair community to the NSS,” the NSS general secretary said.  Changing stance Reiterating that the issue of women’s entry to Sabarimala and the Kerala reformation movement were no way linked to each other, Mr. Nair accused the LDF government of changing its stance on the Sabarimala issue time and again. Former Attorney General K. Parasaran will inaugurate the Jayanti Sammelan on Wednesday.|0|

Outing turns tragic, four teenagers drown|Thiruvananthapuram|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|New Year’s Day ended on a tragic note for the capital city after four teenagers drowned in the estuarine waters near Edayar, Panathura, here. The deceased have been identified as Ibrahim Badusha, 19, Rameez Khan, 17, Navab Khan, and Bismillah Khan. The coastal police, the Fire and Rescue Services, and the local people carried out the search for the boys. Nineteen-year-old Ali Mukhtar, who survived the ordeal, is recovering at the Government Medical College Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram, authorities said. Most of them were students of the Beema Maheen Higher Secondary School, Beemapally. The Poonthura police believe the incident to have occurred around 5 p.m. Seven-member group The five, all reportedly related to each other, were part of a seven-member group that decided to spend the New Year’s Day at the estuary where the Karamana river drains into the sea. According to the police, the currents were especially strong on Tuesday as the sandbar was breached. Two among the group had chosen to stay on the quieter side of the river. The other five had gone bathing in the sea. The area being remote, there was considerable delay in an alarm being raised. There are no houses nearby, and since it was not a designated tourist beach, no lifeguards were posted nearby. Local fishermen came to know about the accident only after they found Mukhtar washed up on the sands. He was immediately rushed to the hospital while a frantic search was launched for the others.|0|
Use cyberworld knowledge to improve mental health: Expert|PATHANAMTHITTA|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Preserving mental health through application of the vast knowledge available in the cyberspace can produce good health, peace and prosperity in society, M.S. Alexander, consultant psychiatrist and Psychotherapist at Leeds and Fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists in the United Kingdom, has said. He was delivering a lecture on ‘Practice of psychotherapy in the new cyberworld’ at the Pushpagiri Institute of Medical Sciences in Thiruvalla on Tuesday. According to him, dominance based on knowledge is shifting from few individuals to the general public and this will need alternative models of psychotherapy. Success in life today depended on the ability of the individual to make use of the knowledge available in the cyberspace, he said. Dr. Alexander said social media could help the society to think and act on various common problems such as alcoholism, drug addiction, depression, and so on and adopt social policies and laws to prevent or manage these conditions.|0|
A message for India: Brinda Karat|THIRUVANANTHAPURAM|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Congratulating the women of Kerala for making history by forming an unbroken women’s wall from one end of the State to another, Communist Party of India (Marxist) Polit Bureau member Brinda Karat said the wall had sent a strong message not just to the women of Kerala, but to women all over India. Ms. Karat, who formed the last link on the southern end of the wall, was inaugurating a public meeting near the statue of social reformer Ayyankali at the Vellayambalam junction here on Tuesday. “Religion has always been used by the ruling classes to keep women in subordinate positions. In India, caste became the most potent form of discrimination and oppression of women. Throughout history, women have never accepted their seconday status. We have had heroines who have fought battles at the individual and social levels, like Nangeli who cut off her breast in protest against the breast tax. These examples of heroism inspired us in building the wall today. We are here today because of the support provided to these movements by reformers such as Narayana Guru, Ayyankali, and Mannath Padmanabhan,” she said. She said we had to realise that those who attacked Ayyankali and abused Narayana Guru had today reincarnated in the shape of the Sangh Parivar and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), who wanted to impose Manuwadi ideology again in India. This would be resisted and fought. “We appeal to the believer women of Kerala to not become pawns in the hands of the RSS, who are using them for a toxic, divisive, and anti-women political goal. It is for you and your girl child that this wall is being built,” she said. Calling the Congress in Kerala a ‘boat with no anchor and no future’, she said it spoke in the voice of the RSS in the morning and that of the Muslim League in the evening. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and veteran CPI(M) leader V.S. Achuthanandan, who initially had reservations about the women’s wall, were present. Except Kerala Pulayar Maha Sabha (KPMS) general secretary Punnala Sreekumar, only the women spoke at the event. Mr. Sreekumar said Sabarimala was just one of the issues that the women’s wall addressed. It was also a message against mob killings, honour killings, and attacks against freedom of expression.  Re-enactment of history “This was a re-enactment of our own history. The wall showed to the world the will of the majority of the Malayalis. The strength drawn from here has to taken forward in resisting regressive forces. We have appealed to the government to ensure that children learn the history of our reform movements right from the early days,” he said. Annie Raja, general secretary of National Federation of Indian Women (NFIW), said that behind every law for women were the blood and sweat of countless women.  It is for you and your girl child that this wall is being built|0|
SIA study done for flyover|S. Anil Radhakrishnan|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|With the completion of the Social Impact Assessment (SIA) study for the 443-m flyover at the busy Ulloor junction, the public hearing will be carried out on January 17. Those to be displaced on account of the land acquisition for the flyover to come up on the National Highway 66-Medical College Road corridor can attend the public hearing to be held at the auditorium of Edankavu temple, Ulloor, from 3 p.m.  Study by IRD The report of the study, mandated by the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, carried out by the city-based Institution of Rural Development (IRD) is ready. As many as 95 landowners and 117 business establishments will be affected by the two-lane flyover and 0.563 hectares of land will have to be acquired. The report prepared by the IRD based on the survey, alignment prepared for the flyover, revenue, and other documents is now available to the landowners for perusal. After the January-17 public hearing, the IRD will have to include the suggestions, if any, being made by those affected and the people’s representatives in the report before the final report on the filyover s submitted to the District Collector.  The 443-m two-lane Ulloor flyover will begin from near the petrol pump after Kochulloor on NH 66 and end near the city Corporation’s Rest House on Medical College Road. Initially, it was decided to have a 390-m flyover at Ulloor. Later, the length was increased by 26.5 m on both sides by altering the slope to 1/25. With this, the cost of the flyover has gone up from the initial Rs. 52.68 crore to Rs. 79.25 crore. The physical demarcation of the land needed was done by Kerala Rapid Transit Corporation Ltd. (KRTL), the Special Purpose Vehicle for Light Metro.  Conceived by DMRC The flyover at Ulloor, along with the one at Sreekaryam, Pattom, and Thampanoor, was conceived by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) as part of the proposed 21.8-km Light Metro corridor. With the exit of the DMRC, the KRTL has been been tasked by the government with the work on flyovers. Administrative sanction has already been given to the Rs. 272.84-crore work on the flyovers to be constructed using funds to be sourced from Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB).  95 landowners and 117 business establishments will be affected by the two-lane flyover|0|
Two lakh women take part|MALAPPURAM|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The women’s wall covering 55 km in the district from Ayikkarapadi to Perinthalmanna became a historic event on Tuesday with nearly two lakh women joining the symbolic wall against social regression. Government figures said that although 1.8 lakh women were to have been part of the wall, nearly two lakh women turned out to build it. CPI(M) State committee member P.K. Sainaba became the first link of the wall at Ayikkarapadi. A large number of men too turned out to support the women. Public meetings marked the conclusion of the wall raised by the women supporting the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government at 10 centres in the district. Minister for Higher Education K.T. Jaleel attended the wall along with his wife Fatimakutty here. Public meetings were held at Ayikkarapadi, Pulikkal, Kondotty, Morayur, Malappuram, Koottilangadi, Ramapuram, Angadipuram, Perinthalmanna and Pulamanthol. Assembly Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan’s wife Divya and mother Seethalakshmi and former Local Administration Minister Paloli Mohammedkutty’s wife K. Khadeeja and daughter Nafeesa were among the prominent women who joined the wall. Real beneficiaries Addressing the women, Mr. Jaleel said that women were the real beneficiaries of the social awakening. The Minister said only societies that attained equality of men and women had progressed. Any groups opposing the progress of the society would be ignored by the people, he added. Inaugurating the public meeting here, All India Democratic Women’s Association general secretary Mariam Dhawale said that the wall had become a part of Indian history. CPI leader P. Gouri presided. P.V. Anvar, MLA, V. Abdurahman, MLA, District Collector Amit Meena, District Police Chief Prateesh Kumar, Malayalam University vice chancellor Anil Vallathol, CPI (M) leaders A. Vijayaraghavan, E.N. Mohandas, and K.P. Sumathi, and Janata Dal leader P.M. Safarulla spoke.|0|
Impressive turnout for women’s wall in Kollam|KOLLAM|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The district saw an impressive turnout of women from all walks of life as they lined up to form a 58-km stretch of the women’s wall on Tuesday. The inflow to various points of the highway started much earlier and by 4 p.m. there was a large crowd who joined the human chain from Oachira to Kadambattukonam. Politicians, social activists, professionals, government employees, cashew workers, Kudumbashree workers, artists and teachers participated in the event and took the Renaissance pledge. Participants carried banners and placards displaying slogans on the necessity to uphold renaissance values and resist regressive forces. Expressing solidarity Natascha, a tourist from Germany, said she along with her friends decided to join the wall as a gesture to express their solidarity. “We read in the papers that it’s a wall for equality and we think women should stand up for their rights,” she said. A huge crowd also gathered for the public meeting where Minister J. Mercykutty Amma addressed the participants. “Kerala has set an example to the world by building this wall of love. The wall saw a participation of women from all walks of life and it indicates we will collectively resist the attempts of reactionary forces trying to create a riot in the State,” she said. The Minister urged women to march ahead in the struggle to ensure equality and stay alert against those trying to create divisions. “The success of the women’s wall does not mean our responsibility is over,” she added. Kepco chairperson J. Chinju Rani presided over the function. Art exhibition  A Renaissance art exhibition was also held in Kollam city, jointly organised by the State Youth Commission, Kerala State Literacy Mission Authority and district information office. The days of slave trade, Kallumala revolt, Achipudava strike, Indanthuruthil Mana where Gandhiji was made to sit outside, Vaikom Satyagraha, Guruvayur Satyagraha and Temple Entry Proclamation found place in the exhibition.|0|
LDF upbeat about large turnout for women’s wall|THIRUVANANTHAPURAM|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The impressive turnout for the women's wall seems to have made a strong political statement against the Sangh Parivar and other organisations who are up in arms against the Left Democratic Front government on the Sabarimala issue. The LDF leadership sees a definite edge for the ruling front in the response to the movement, which drew support from Backward Class organisations and minority communities, as it braces up for the general elections within the next few months. The managers of the programme seek to highlight the largely secular nature of the assemblage to buttress the political message against the Sangh Parivar and its allies. What was initially conceived as a women’s initiative of Hindu community organisations has been a remarkable participation of the Christian and Muslim communities besides an active solidarity from the menfolk. The front believes that it has to a great extent taken the sting out of the United Democratic Front and the Bharatiya Janata Party bid to cast a communal colour to the campaign. Sabarimala issue Though the proposal for forming the wall was tossed up at a conclave of Hindu community organisations such as the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP) Yogam, legatees of the social reform movement, against the backdrop of the Supreme Court verdict on Sabarimala, the idea evolved in the face of stringent UDF and BJP criticism of the government handling of the Sabarimala issue. The government clarified, in due course, that it would have the active involvement of the Christian and Muslim communities that had made substantial inputs for the social churning in the State. The stringent criticism of the Nair Service Society and others were feared to queer the pitch, but a sustained campaign over a month seems to have deflected the flak it drew from various segments. A resolution passed by the NSS against the government and the Chief Minister on Monday do not seem to have made any impact on the campaign. The wall, as CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan said, would kick-start a national campaign for ensuring 33% women’s reservation in the Assembly and Parliament and a series of programmes to end the alleged discrimination against women in different sectors. A lead the State traditionally enjoys in various sectors including 50% women’s reservation in local bodies needs to be carried forward and the wall would be a start, he had said.|0|
Swamy Visudhananda flays women’s wall|Thiruvananthapuram|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Sivagiri pilgrimage concluded on Tuesday with Swamy Visudhananda, president, Sree Narayana Dhrma Sangham Trust (SNDST), launching a scathing attack on the women’s wall campaign for having disrupted the pilgrimage on the final day. Addressing a meeting of science and technology experts at the Sivagiri Madhom, Varkala, Swamy Visudhananda attributed the poor turnout at the function to the women’s wall that was organised across the State. “Every year, politicians come here to address functions during the pilgrimage and extol the virtues of Sree Narayana Guru. But their actions do not reflect the ideals upheld by Guru. Did they have to organise the women’s wall on this day itself,” he asked on the occasion. Seeds of knowledge The Swamy said that Sri Narayana Guru had initiated the pilgrimage to sow the seeds of knowledge in the minds of people. “He had mooted the idea of imbibing knowledge from experts in various subjects. The people behind the women’s wall should think whether they should have organised the event on this day itself,” he said.|0|
A wall of paintings parallel to women’s wall|THIRUVANANTHAPURAM|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Parallel to the women’s wall opposite the public office was a women’s art wall, made up of paintings by 36 women artists from across the State. The artists began working on the unbroken canvas on Tuesday morning, based on the theme of reform movements. The event was organised by the Kerala Lalithakala Akademi. Kajal Deth, an artist from Cherthala, chose to depict the legendary Nangeli, who cut off her a breast in protest against the breast tax. “Nangeli’s story is something that we have been hearing from childhood, and has been inspiring me since. I also belong to the place she hailed from. Now, there are plans to rename a junction after her. I thought she is apt to represent the idea of the women’s wall. This is a great experience of public art, at a time when I get more feedback through my Instagram page than in the real world,” she says.  Sustained attacks Grace Philip, an artist from Pathanamthitta, used the canvas as a lament on the continued attacks on the values of our reform movements. “We have, in recent months, seen how there has been sustained attacks on our progressive values, which we have held dear and of which we were so proud. But it cannot be destroyed so easily. A fightback is happening,” she says. Rejini S.R. from Kayamkulam was at work on an intriguing image showing a set of fingers on a dark green background. “Tell me what you have understood from the painting,” she asks the viewers. Amused at the variety of interpretations, she later shares the hidden meanings. It is an in-your-face reaction from women who have suffered for long. Lalithakala Akademi chairman Nemom Pushaparaj said the unbroken canvas would later be separated, with the individual paintings being put up for exhibition.|0|
Ten arrested during New Year revelry|THIRUVANANTHAPURAM|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Ten people were arrested by the Chirayinkeezhu police for allegedly attacking two police officers, including a sub-inspector, during the early hours of Tuesday. The incident took place at Azhoor, near Chirayinkeezhu, by around 1 a.m. when a police team had gone to the area to control the group of around 35 people, who were creating nuisance under the influence of alcohol. Local residents complained that they were engaged in New Year’s celebrations using blaring loudspeakers. The gang purportedly attacked the police officials after they attempted to turn off the mike system. Besides manhandling the officers, the gang also allegedly vandalised the police jeep.|0|
Record daily collection of Rs. 7.95 crore in KSRTC|THIRUVANANTHAPURAM|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The ailing Kerala State Road Transport Corporation’s (KSRTC) management is on cloud nine as the revenue from the fleet has been going up ever since the services of 4,071 empanelled conductors were terminated on December 18 as directed by the Kerala High Court. Though the 1,485 reserve conductors recruited through the Kerala Public Service Commission have not been deployed on buses, the KSRTC registered a record collection of Rs. 7.95 crore from the fleet on December 31, 2018 . The demand for seats on KSRTC buses after the Christmas vacation in educational institution was cited one of the reason. Instead of the Rs. 3.5 crore daily used for purchase of high speed diesel for the fleet, the KSRTC could manage the fuel bill for Rs. 2.63 crore on December 31. The fuel bill also includes the fleet used for Sabarimala services. Sources said the State transport undertaking had been able to save Rs. 56.63 lakh daily after the services of the 4,071 empanelled conductors were terminated. Of the Rs. 56.63 lakh being saved daily, Rs. 37.61 lakh is towards the fuel bill, Rs. 5.76 lakh for purchase of tyre and spare parts and Rs. 13.26 lakh for salary of the personnel. The KSRTC was able to save Rs. 38.69 lakh daily towards the operational cost through scientific revamp of the schedules.. The corporation was able to get an additional income of Rs. 12 crore monthly from the fleet even when the schedules were curtailed. The revenue increase from ticket collection was when 661 buses did not ply and there was a decrease of around 2 lakh km. The sources said it was now clear that the scientific running of schedules will fetch revenue and that the number of employees does not matter.|0|
Family held for murder attempt, robbery|Thiruvananthapuram|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The police on Tuesday arrested a couple and their 17-year-old son for attempted murder of a woman by pushing her from a bridge into the Achencoil river. The Karamana police arrested Praveen, 36, of Mannar, wife Manju, 32, and their son, on a complaint filed by the 53-year-old homemaker from Killipalam in Thiruvananthapuram. The trio, arrested on the basis of a complaint filed by the woman who survived the ordeal, have been charged with murder attempt and robbery.  Marriage offer According to the police, Praveen had befriended the woman and, hiding the fact that he was married, offered to marry her. Convincing her that they would live at Mannar, he made her sell a piece of her property. The woman left with Praveen with the Rs. 1.75 lakh she obtained from the sale. While travelling on a train, Praveen introduced his wife and son to the woman as his sister and her son. When attempts to snatch the money failed, Praveen took her to a bridge spanning the Achencoil river at 11 p.m. After grabbing the money, Manju and the boy pushed the woman into the river. Leaving her for dead, the three had fled the spot. However, the woman swam to one of the pillars and began crying for help. Assistance came two hours later from a man who lived nearby. He raised an alarm and the woman was rushed to a hospital at Mavelikara. Subsequently, she filed a complaint with the Karamana police, which led to the arrests on Tuesday morning by a team led by Karamana SI R.S. Sreekanth. The accused have admitted to the crime, the police said. The police recovered from them part of the stolen money, jewellery purchased with the money, and the woman’s a mobile phone. Praveen is wanted in Mannar in connection with a number of casess. Manju is Praveen’s second wife. His first wife had died in mysterious circumstances.|0|
Time to speak up, say women|THIRUVANANTHAPURAM|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Shyama, a homemaker from Vanchiyoor, had rarely ever participated in a mass movement. On Monday afternoon, she, along with a neighbour, stood by the side of the road near the Napier Museum, as the women’s wall began taking shape. Before long, they both had become links of a massive women’s wall, a missing link for which was hard to find. “I felt that it is about time more women came forward and spoke their mind. We have seen women being beaten up and driven away just because they wanted to worship. Women cannot be treated like they are unequal to men,” Shyama said. Not everyone on that link had such clarity of thought, but most of them had a clear idea of the basic messages behind the women’s wall. Members of Communist Party of India (Marxist)’s local committees, each of which were allotted a specific length of the road along the wall, began bringing in the workers by 2.30 p.m. at various locations. Along with them were members of organisations like Kerala Pulayar Maha Sabha (KPMS), Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam, and other community organisations. Amid them were people from all walks of lives, who were not officially part of any of these organisations. Many of them came with their children. In several stretches, men lined up on the opposite side of the road, some of them beaming it live on their phones. “The women’s wall was in the discussion for the past many days. It felt like an interesting movement to be part of. Women have not lined up like this in our State before. This is a clear message of change,” S. Athira, a student, said.  In front of the Technopark, hundreds of employees from various companies joined the wall, despite the New year day being a holiday.|0|
People rejected women’s wall: Cong.|THIRUVANANTHAPURAM|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The public have rejected the women’s wall that was projected with great fanfare by the CPI(M), Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala has said. Mr.Chennithala said in a release here that the CPI(M) misused government machinery and intimidated employees to become part of the campaign. Still it was a failure. Though people were carted in vehicles in urban areas, sufficient numbers could not be mustered in rural areas. The women’s wall formed by misusing power and resources failed to evoke any movement in the State, KPCC president Mullapally Ramachandran has said. He said the minorities were kept off the campaign and it was aimed at disrupting the Sivagiri pilgrimage. An undeclared holiday paralysed the functioning of the Secretariat and other offices. Schools remained closed and university examinations were put off to facilitate the formation of the wall, he said. The campaign was taken up at a time when the post-flood relief and rebuilding activities were limping, he said.|0|
Of renaissance values|Thiruvananthapuram|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Around 3.30 p.m. on New Year’s Day, as the women’s wall began taking shape on the National Highway at Pallipuram, Chandrika Amma, a Communist Party of India (Marxist) worker from Manickal, pointed to the serpentine line of participants extending to her left and right. ‘‘We definitely are not talking politics here,’’ she said. ‘’Not all of us are party workers, of course. But the wall is meant to create awareness about renaissance values. So it will succeed,” she added. The women’s wall witnessed heavy turnout along the NH stretch passing through Kazhakuttam, Kaniyapuram, and Pallipuram to Attingal and beyond. CPI(M) units had transported bus-loads of women workers and sympathisers from all over the district to form an unbroken chain.  Traffic snarls Women had begun lining up along the NH shortly after 3 p.m. under the supervision of party workers. Owing to the added traffic and the ongoing road work, major junctions witnessed traffic snarls despite efforts to keep the roads open. “If so many women, many of them carrying children, are participating, then surely it must be a success? Even physically challenged people are attending the event,” Sheela, a homemaker from Pothencode, who was part of the wall at Pallipuram, said. The wall broke up shortly after 4 p.m., with the women taking a pledge to uphold gender equality and renaissance values. In Thiruvananthapuram district, the wall stretched from Vellayambalam Junction and passed through Museum, PMG, Kesavadasapuram, Kazhakuttam, Kaniyapuram, Pallipuram, Attingal, and Kadambattukonam before entering Kollam. There was also a section of participants who firmly maintained that the women’s wall should not be mixed up with women’s entry to the Sabarimala temple. “The two issues should not be linked. We have come here because the women’s wall is meant to highlight issues such as renaissance values and women’s safety,” said Shobhana, a homemaker from Thachapally.|0|

Women line up for gender equality|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|From Page 1 The wall of women was not without discord and, if anything, starkly underscored the fault lines of Kerala society.  NSS general secretary G. Sukumaran Nair said the wall would transform Kerala into a “devil’s own” country riven by social strife. The NSS had opposed the wall. SNDP general secretary Vellappally Natesan said the wall was a riposte to those who sought to turn Kerala into a “madhouse” of caste-based discrimination. Mr. Nair criticised Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan for intervening in matters of faith while Mr. Natesan defended the government’s stance on fighting revanchist forces. Health Minister K.K. Shylaja and Brinda Karat, general secretary of the All India Democratic Women’s Association, held either end of the human wall in Kasaragod and Thiruvananthapuram respectively. Mr. Vijayan and Administrative Reforms Commission chairperson V.S. Achuthanandan witnessed the wall in the capital. KPMS president Punnala Sreekumar and Mr. Natesan also participated.|0|

Crucial Cong. meet on tie-ups tomorrow|ANANTAPUR|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|AICC president Rahul Gandhi has asked APCC president N. Raghuveera Reddy and AICC general secretary Oommen Chandy be in New Delhi on January 3 to discuss the party’s stand on political alignments in the general elections. Addressing the media after participating in the New Year celebrations at his home town Neelakanthapuram in Madakasira mandal, Mr. Raghuveera Reddy said the decision that would emerge at the meeting would set the tone for the elections. Appeal to Modi “The meeting will decide with whom the Congress will ally with for the elections in April, and the decision of the leadership will be binding on all,” he said. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi should come to Andhra Pradesh only after fulfilling all the promises made by him in Tirupati and Amaravati. Giving Special Category Status (SCS) for 10 years and implementing all the provisions of the A.P. Reorganisation Act are a prerequisite for him to sound credible when he speaks here in the State,” Mr. Reddy added. Talking about the rise in the prices of petrol, diesel, and cooking gas, he said, while the prices were increasing steeply, the reduction, if any, was not significant. The NDA government at the Centre had totally neglected the farmers, he said.

‘A voice against social fragmentation’|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|“A strong voice against the ongoing social fragmentation in Kerala” is how writer P. Valsala described the women’s wall. Speaking at a public meeting held as part of the women’s wall here on Tuesday, she called for a fraternity beyond caste and religious barriers and claimed that the wall was a reminder that Kerala society stood for cultural values. Actor Rima Kallingal, who dropped in to support the wall in Kozhikode, said: “The space women enjoy in society these days is the result of the sweat of a lot of people. Now it is our responsibility to use this space properly and preserve it.” Writer B.M. Suhara said the wall was a declaration that women could no longer be confined to their homes. Writer Khadeeja Mumtaz said it was a warning from women who would not allow communal bifurcation of the State. Artist Kabitha Mukhopadhyaya made her presence felt through a Bangla song which she translated to English for the sake of the audience. Writer Deedhi Damodaran sought public discussions on religious politics as women were the worst victims of such politics. Activists K. Ajitha, V.P. Zuhra, Viji Penkoottu, writers K.P. Sudheera, C.S. Chandrika and Arya Gopi were present. A group of transgender individuals under Punarjani Cultural Society took part in the wall as well. “This is our gentle reminder that like women, we too deserve a space in society,” Punarjani president Sisily George said.|0|

Chittoor police going for digital surveillance system|CHITTOOR|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|In order to bring down the crime rate to zero, the Chittoor district police have embarked on an ambitious digital surveillance project by installing 730 high resolution cameras in Chittoor, Puttur, Palamaner and Madanapalle sub-divisions. Nearly 60% of the work has been completed. Speaking toThe Hindu, Deputy SP (Crime) I. Ramakrishna said that the “cloud-based surveillance” could help police with multiple features, including facial recognition, video analysis and number plate recognition. The equipment had already been fixed at several important mandal headquarters and junctions along the National Highways. He said these high resolution cameras are in addition to the 850-plus cameras which are already functioning with the police department, several public and private firms. The official said that fearing the presence of the cameras, criminals have started taking their operations away from the district headquarters of Chittoor, and other municipalities of Madanapalle, Punganur, Palamaner, Puttur and Nagari to rural areas. “We are strengthening the digital surveillance in rural areas too, though it would take some time to fully cover all areas. In recent months, we apprehended chain-snatching culprits in many rural areas. In a few months, we will be able to cover the remaining 30%,” Mr. Ramakrishna said. The DSP said a series of meeting was held with bankers, petrol pumps, jewelry mart owners, dhaba operators along the national highways, educational institutions and even households at vital junctions to encourage them to set up the cameras on their premises. “The meetings proved fruitful. We have cameras even in some narrow streets at many places now. In the future, this will help us bust crimes in a short span of time. The massive presence of the digital surveillance has also helped instill a sense of fear among criminals,” he said. The gold theft case from a bus near Bangarupalem was cracked thanks to digital surveillance, leading to the arrest of a notorious Maharashtra gang, Mr. Ramakrishna said. The entire digital surveillance system would be linked to the command control at Chittoor, and this in turn would be accessed by the central command at Vijayawada.|0|

Prakash Raj to contest LS election|BENGALURU|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Actor and activist Prakash Raj, on New Year’s Day, announced his decision to enter electoral politics by declaring that he will contest the 2019 Lok Sabha polls as an Independent and said he will announce his constituency subsequently. Taking to Twitter just after midnight, he wrote: “HAPPY NEW YEAR TO EVERYONE... a new beginning... more responsibility... with UR support I will be contesting in the coming parliament elections as an INDEPENDENT CANDIDATE. Details of the constituency soon. Ab ki Baar Janatha ki SARKAR #citizensvoice #justasking in parliament too” It is being speculated that he might choose Telangana rather than Karnataka. While questions are being asked if he will be part of the ‘mahagatbandhan’ and contest from Karnataka, the speculation is that he might not. The actor in the past had supported the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) of K. Chandrashekar Rao, who is busy in putting together, what he calls, a “People’s Front”, which is anti-BJP and anti-Congress. Recently, Mr. Rao had met Janata Dal (Secular) patriarch H.D. Deve Gowda along with Mr. Raj to persuade him to join the “People’s Front.” It is speculated that Mr. Raj might contest from Telangana since he is assured of TRS support.|0|

Kidnapped boy restored to parents|TIRUPATI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|It was a happy ending in the Tirumala chid abduction case, as the sixteen-month-old Veeresh was restored to his parents on Tuesday. Prashanth Jadhav and Sneha burst into tears on receiving their son from Superintendent of Police (Tirupati Urban) K.K.N. Anburajan. The abductor, I. Vishwambar Goud, was sighted by locals when he was moving suspiciously with the child at the famous Renuka Devi temple in Mahur town of Nanded district in Maharashtra. With the images of the boy and the sketch of the accused already getting flashed across the media, the locals promptly alerted the police, who arrested him and rescued the child. Frustrated at not getting married, the 43-year-old maistry from Bheemgal in Nizamabad district of Telangana admitted to have abducted the boy with the intention of adoption, as he could be of help in his old age. Vishwambar allegedly lifted the child from his parents who were sleeping in a ‘mandapam’ in the open during a pilgrimage to Tirumala four days ago. He also disclosed to the police that ahead of his abduction plan, he was intercepted by the TTD vigilance guards at Tirumala on suspicion, but he escaped by providing false identity. After his arrest in Mahur, he was produced in a local court and brought to Tirupati on transit warrant. Role of technology Technology played a vital role in busting the case within 48 hours. The CCTV footage from a series of thirty cameras captured from Tirumala hills and Tirupati railway station gave the major breakthrough, while the images shared by the police went viral on print, electronic and social media, thus helping in tracking him in Nanded. As inputs kept pouring in, the Police Department formed six teams, rushed them to various States like Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka besides alerting the railway police. Tagging for safety After this incident, the police decided to go ahead with child-tagging on regular basis, an option resorted to by them only during the Brahmotsavams and other major congregations. “The tag has two portions, one tied to the child’s wrist and the other retained by the parent. The matching tags will be checked at all entry/exit points to ensure that the child is with its rightful guardian,” Mr. Anburajan told the media. The Superintendent of Police announced rewards for the police team involved in the child’s rescue operation.|0|

Lok Sabha poll: Deve Gowda hints at seeking 10 or 11 seats|NEW DELHI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Congress-Janata Dal (Secular) seat-sharing for the Lok Sabha polls may be finalised as early as January-end, with former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda, who is also the JD(S) chief, hinting that his party wants 10 or 11 seats out of the 28 in Karnataka, or roughly one-third of the Lok Sabha seats. Speaking at a press conference in New Delhi, he said at the time of government formation in Karnataka in the face of a hung Assembly, the Congress had promised unconditional support. “Since then they have got two-third of the portfolios, which is different from when (Chief Minister) H.D. Kumaraswamy was in government with the BJP, which had 79 MLAs (with the Janata Dal-Secular — at 58 seats) but the ministerial berths were almost equal. But since this one-third formula is being adopted, then it should be taken forward,” Mr. Gowda argued. His statement is significant in that sources had been indicating that the Congress was willing to offer only 6 or 7 seats to the JD(S) and Mr. Gowda’s party was asking for more. Attacks Modi He also said that he hoped that the arrangement would be finalised by the end of January. Mr. Gowda also attacked the Narendra Modi government’s stance on agrarian issues and the Prime Minister’s remarks on the farm loan waiver announced by the Kumaraswamy government in a recent booth-level interaction with BJP workers from Karnataka. “If he [Prime Minister] has not realised even after seeing the biggest demonstration in Maharashtra, where his party is in power, then people will take note of his callousness,” Mr. Gowda said. Stating that no government had survived by neglecting farmers, Mr. Gowda said: “If political parties neglect the farming community, farmers will teach them a lesson.” ‘Rs. 350 cr. paid to farmers’   Hitting back at Mr. Modi on his comment on poor implementation of Karnataka’s farm loan waiver, Mr. Gowda said: “He made a sarcastic remark, making fun of the Karnataka government. Not less than 60,000 farmers have benefited so far. About Rs. 350 crore has already been paid to them electronically into their bank accounts.” All eligible farmers would be benefited under the scheme, he said, and added that the JD(S)-Congress coalition government was implementing the loan waiver scheme in a “transparent” manner.   Cong. had promised unconditional support during govt. formation. Since then they have got two-third of the portfolios, which is different from when H. D. Kumaraswamy was in government with the BJP.

New Year: moderate turnout at Tirumala|TIRUMALA|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|New Year day on Tuesday witnessed a moderate turnout of the pilgrim crowd at the temple of Lord Venkateswara. The temple and its inner precincts were tastefully decorated with varied hues of aromatic flowers and colourfully illuminated befitting the occasion. As is the practice observed on special and festive occasions, the main doors of the temple were re-opened minutes after the zero hours heralding New Year. The VIPs who were in a limited number were the first to be allowed for darshan. The spirits of the TTD officials who made elaborate arrangements were dampened with the turnout being below their expectations. The authorities attributed the reasons to the overplaying of the crowd factor and cancellation of all kinds of darshan formats including the online darshan tickets. For the records, the hill temple for the past couple of years has been experiencing a thin attendance in the pilgrim crowd on New Year day. With the TTD also cancelling the footpath darshan tokens, both trekking routes from Alipiri and Srivari mettu also sported a weary look. On the other hand, the low turnout of VIPs proved a blessing for ordinary devotees who were allowed for darshan well before 4 a.m.|0|

Women line up for gender equality|Thiruvananthapuram|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Lakhs of women assembled under the aegis of theLDF on Tuesday to create an almost unbroken human wall that stretched 620 km from Kasaragod in north Kerala to Thiruvananthapuram in the south. Perhaps, the only jarring gap in the wall of women was at Chettukundu in Kasaragod where suspected Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers unleashed violence against those who tried to line up on the road. The police fired tear gas shells to subdue the mob. Police officers, journalists, and passers-by came under attack and vehicles were damaged. Law enforcers have diverted traffic away from the spot, which continued to be a conflict zone late into the night. The LDF has pledged to create a wall along the disrupted stretch on Wednesday. Women from all walks of life participated in the programme, which the LDF had posited as a political counter to Hindu right-wing forces opposed to the entry of women to Sabarimala. Senior women, homemakers, women clad in hijabs, lawyers, transwomen, actors, artists, doctors, teachers, students, authors, civil servants, unskilled workers, government employees, members of social organisations such as the Kerala Pulayar Maha Sabha and the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP) Yogam congregated alongside National Highways. They stood shoulder to shoulder for 15 minutes after 4 p.m. to form a human wall with few apparent cracks in the line. The programme ended with a joint pledge to harness the power of renaissance principles to insulate society against revanchist forces that sought to push Kerala back to the dark ages of casteism and discriminatory religious practices. Dissenting voice The wall of women was not without discord and, if anything, starkly underscored the fault lines of Kerala society. NSS general secretary G. Sukumaran Nair, said that the wall would transform Kerala into a “devil’s own” country riven by social strife. The NSS had opposed the wall. SNDP general secretary Vellappally Natesan said the wall was a riposte to those who sought to turn Kerala into a “madhouse” of caste-based discrimination. Mr. Nair criticised Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan for intervening in matters of faith while Mr. Natesan defended the government’s stance on fighting revanchist forces. Health Minister K.K. Shylaja and Brinda Karat, general secretary of the All India Democratic Women’s Association (AIDWA), held either end of the human wall in Kasaragod and Thiruvananthapuram respectively. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Administrative Reforms Commission chairperson V.S. Achuthanandan witnessed the wall in the capital. KPMS president Punnala Sreekumar and Mr. Natesan also participated.|0|

A ‘happy birthday’ for inmates of orphanage|TIRUPATI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Loud shrieks of ‘Happy New Year’ were followed by the ‘Happy Birthday’ song at the Akshaya Kshetram home, with over 50 children singing the song not for any one person but for each other. The institution, which is a home for children with special needs, is located at Durgasamudram in Tirupati Rural. Many children abandoned outside the Tirumala temple are brought to this home, whose doors are always open. Rise in arrivals Most of the children brought to this home are mentally challenged. Abandoned by their parents in their early years, they do not know their date of birth, which is why the Akshaya Kshetram home celebrates the birthdays of 50 of its 150 inmates on January 1. The home’s founder-couple M. Ramaswamy (92) and M. Varalakshmi (88), tirelessly celebrate the occasion every year. TTD vigilance guards who stumble upon infants abandoned in Tirumala bring them straight to Akshaya Kshetram for rehabilitation. The number of arrivals have begun to rise in recent years, especially children who are mentally challenged. Merry time After cutting the cake together, all the children took part in song and dance, and watched a magic show performed by noted magician and mimicry artiste D. Vijaykumar. Students from Sri Venkateswara University collected money and arranged for biscuits, cakes and other goodies for the ‘birthday babies’. The couple’s NRI daughter Lavanya Rao, who has recently taken over the running of the home’s activities, supervised the arrangements.|0|
When ice factories found sanctuary in Kolleru|Vijayawada|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Two ice-making units had been running in the heart of wildlife sanctuary for nearly ten years and the authorities could do little to stop them. One unit was closed down only recently. Kolleru is the largest fresh water lake in the country. The lake expands up to +10 feet above mean sea level (MSL) contour with a waterspread of 901 square kilometres in the rainy season and shrinks to + 3 contour with a waterspread of 135 sq.km in summer. In 1999, as many as 308 sq.km of the lake falling below +5 contour was declared the Kolleru Wildlife Sanctuary (KWS). According to the Azeez Committee Report submitted to the Centre in April 2011, “not-so-benign activities and encroachments continued unabated in the sanctuary area.” While hundreds of aquaculture tanks kept popping up from time to time, the case of the of the ice-making units came to light only recently. Non-bailable offence Though encroachment of land in wildlife sanctuaries is a non-bailable offence, different government agencies have granted permissions to the owner of the ice-making unit. The Forest Department filed writ petitions seeking the closure of the units owned by Jampana Ramaraju between Dharmapuram and Siddhapuram, close to Kolletikota, in January last. The matter came to the notice of the Forest Department only when a Dharmapuram farmer — Muneendara Rao — filed a writ petition in the High Court, saying that the ice-making units were well within the +5 contour. Owner moves court The High Court issued an order for the closure of one unit. Meanwhile, the owner of moved the court seeking a stay on the ground that the constitutional rights he enjoyed under Article 14 and 21 had been violated. The case is scheduled to come up for hearing in the HC on January 22. Kolleru Lake conservation crusader T.

State’s economy on high growth path: CM|VIJAYAWADA|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The State’s economy has grown from Rs. 4.64 lakh crore in 2013-14 to Rs. 8.04 lakh crore in 2017-18 (advance estimates), registering an average growth of 14.72%, according to Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu. Releasing a White Paper on ‘State finance and economic growth’ at Grievance hall near his residence at Undavalli near here on Tuesday, Mr. Naidu said that per capita income (PCI) registered a growth of 14.87% in 2017-18 compared to 8.4% in 2014-15. The PCI remained higher than the national average during the last four years. The State could achieve a record double-digit economic growth even during times of adversity and ‘non-cooperation’ from the Central government. Also, Andhra Pradesh had achieved faster growth rate than Telangana, where the eco-system had already been in place. In addition, AP inherited huge revenue deficit, he said. The revenue expenditure has increased from Rs. 79,471 crore in 2014-15 to Rs. 1,21,214 crore in 2017-18 mainly due to shifting of capital and offices from Hyderabad to Amaravati, revision of wages of Anganwadi workers and others, capital infusion to SHGs, and loan waiver, etc. On other hand, the capital expenditure increased to Rs. 9,720 crore in 2017-18 from Rs. 7,285 crore in 2013-14 and Rs. 5,938 crore in 2014-15, he said.

The theory that more capital expenditure was a sign of growth needs to be viewed from people’s perspective. Smartphones People were looking for more welfare schemes and programmes. So, there has to be a perfect balance between welfare and wealth creation. “ Else, poverty alleviation was not possible. Happiness, quality of life, highest growth of GSDP, and PCI were the targets of the State government, he said, adding “the government has released 10 white papers in the run-up to the elections.” The government proposed to prepare vision documents for the State and districts for 2019-24 based on the feedback from the public on the white papers.

South India largely ignored in history writing: Rajmohan Gandhi|VIJAYAWADA|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Author and research professor Rajmohan Gandhi said that south India has largely been forgotten in history writing and other writing of our country in the last several decades and south India is distinct from other parts of the country. Mr. Rajmohan Gandhi, grandson of Mahatma Gandhi, released his latest book ‘Modern South India: A History from the 17th Century to Our Times,’ at the inaugural function of the 30th Vijayawada Book Festival held on the dais named after Yaddanapudi Sulochana Rani, on Swaraj Maidan premises named after Navabharat Prakash Rao, in the city on Tuesday. Speaking on the occasion Mr. Gandhi said, “North India will know about south India when they read this book because south India has largely been forgotten in the history writing and other writing of our country in the last 50-60 years. Also, south Indians will learn about their neighbouring States.” “Some people may ask if south India is more than the geographical term. It has a meaning very distinct from the west, east and north Indian parts. There is indeed something cultural, social and even ideological about south India which is more than just a technical term as per my understanding,” he said. Theme of unity Quoting poet Sri Sri’s lines about people, Mr. Gandhi said that south Indian poets and writers have uniquely expressed the precious notion that people are one and they constitute the land. Chief Electoral Officer R.P. Sisodia said though it seems like the book is dying a natural death in the world of electronic devices, those who know the value of books also know that it has no competition. He said that books give greater scope for the imagination of the readers unlike videos or any visual representation that restricts one’s imagination. Mr. Sisodia said that literature is what an author writes out of his mind and anything that is written to serve the need of certain readers is not literature. Deputy Assembly Speaker Mandali Buddha Prasad presided over the function. Telugu writer K. Enoch, Mayor Koneru Sreedhar, Collector B. Lakshmikantham, Mr. Rajmohan Gandhi’s wife Usha, and Hyderabad Book Fair Society president J. Gowrishankar were among those present.|0|

Game, set and match for the police in Agency|VISAKHAPATNAM|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Former American soccer player Julie Foudy had once said: “Sports build good habits, confidence, and discipline. They make players community leaders and teach them how to strive for a goal, handle mistakes, and cherish growth opportunities.” And the district police seem to have taken a cue from this quote. For the first time in the Visakhapatnam Agency, the police organised a flood-lit volleyball tournament on the eve of New Year. And more importantly, the tournament was held at Nurmati in G. Madugula mandal, considered to be a Maoist stronghold and located in the AOB region. “Holding a volleyball tournament in the night in the AOB region is a risky one as there is a considerable presence of Maoists in the area. But we want to infuse confidence in the tribal youth and bring them into the mainstream,” said SP Attada Babujee. Over 3,000 youth along with their family members attended the tournament and 106 teams from 100 villages of various mandals such as Pedabayalu, G. Madugula, Munchingput, Chintapalli and Araku participated in it. Seeing the overwhelming response, the tournament was spread over a period of two days, and finals and semi-final matches were held till 3 a.m. on Tuesday. It was a festive atmosphere as the entire area, which normally plunges into darkness after sunset, was lit up with flood lights. The the police even provided food for all the people. But all excitement was about the matches, said Kilo Surendra from G. Madugula. “It’s a good way to bid goodbye to the previous year and a bright beginning for New Year, as the sport of volleyball is like our religion and the tournament is well fought between the teams,” said Mr. Surendra. The tournament was held under the banner ‘Yuva ho’ as a part of the community policing initiative of the police. Folk dances The police also organised tribal folk dances such as ‘dhimsa’ to entertain the crowd and served some tribal delicacies. To usher in New Year, the SP and his team cut over 10 cakes at the stroke of midnight and distributed them among the team members. Prize distribution The first prize was bagged by Onuru village and the winners took home the trophy and a prize money of Rs. 50,000. The runners and second runners-up were given Rs. 15,000 and Rs. 10,000 respectively along with the trophies.|0|

Constitutional sanctity sought for Backward Classes quota|HYDERABAD|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Backward Classes Welfare Association has demanded that the Central Government take the initiative in restoring the 34% reservations to backward classes in the local body election by making necessary amendments to the Constitution. Association president and former MLA R. Krishnaiah said the government had issued ordinance restricting the reservation to BCs to 23% against the 34% implemented in the previous elections in 2013. This was because of the directive given by the Supreme Court to cap the reservations at 50% in line with the constitutional mandate. He lamented that the High Court and Supreme Court were interfering in the provision of reservations to BCs from time to time and a permanent solution for the issue could be arrived at by making necessary amendments to the Constitution. Mr. Krishnaiah addressed letters to all the political parties, including the Congress and the BJP at the national-level, and said he had decided to raise the issue at the national-level during the current session of the Parliament. The problem, according to him, was the absence of legal sanctity to reservations for the backward classes. The government which provided reservations to SCs, STs and women during the passage of Bills making the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments, however, left the BC reservation issue to the States’ purview. Absence of constitutional sanctity to the BC reservation was giving scope for intervention by the courts from time to time. He felt that the 50% cap prescribed on reservations in education and government recruitment had technical rationale as it was aimed at ensuring that merit did not suffer. There was, however, no justification in extending the same yardstick to politics as politics were being dominated by industrialists, contractors and rich sections.|0|

No GST cut in movie tickets yet|Hyderabad|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|A 10% drop in Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates from January 1 should have translated into a Rs. 15 dip in ticket prices at multiplexes where the ticket rates are priced at Rs. 150. Right? Wrong. Cinegoers who queued up to spend a few hours at the movies found no relief in ticket prices at most cinema halls. “There is no change in rates. If the company changes the rates it will be automatically reflected in the bill,” said the cashier at PVR Multiplex in Panjagutta before the evening show. The GST Council, in its 31st meeting in New Delhi on December 22, had recommended a reduction on GST in ticket prices. “GST rate on cinema tickets above Rs. 100 shall be reduced from 28% to 18% and on cinema tickets up to Rs. 100 from 18% to 12%,” was the recommendation. States, Centre notify The cut in rates was notified by the states and Centre with effect from midnight of December 31. But on the first day of the new year, there was no implementation in change of rates in cinema halls in Hyderabad. ‘Approach GST cell’ “There has to be a reduction in prices once the new rates are notified. If they are not implemented, consumers can take up the issue with the anti-evasion cell of GST’s Hyderabad Commissionerate,” said a commissionerate official, when asked about non-implementation of cut in GST by cinema owners. While moviegoers could do little besides having a small argument with the ticketing staff, others took to social media to raise the issue. “@PVRSupport Why are the ticket rates same at PVR cinemas Hyderabad in spite of revised GST effective from today? (sic),” tweeted Prithiv Siddharth. “The rates have not changed. We have no idea when the rates will change,” said a staffer at Prasads Multiplex, one of the more popular entertainment centres in the city. The cut in GST on movie tickets was notified after a sustained and high-voltage campaign by the mandarins of movie industry. The benefit of the cut in taxes have to be passed on to consumers as there are stringent norms for filing the GST returns.|0|

Relaunch agitation They threatened to relaunch the agitation if any attempt was made to “forcibly” acquire their farm lands for the project. They insisted that the existing stretch of the Khammam-Devarapalli State highway be developed to avoid loss of large tracts of agricultural lands. The Joint Action Committee of aggrieved farmers has called for a dharna here on Wednesday in protest against what it called renewed attempts by the departments concerned to acquire the agricultural lands of hundreds of farmers in nine mandals.|1|Wednesday

Man holds NTPC engineer’s kin hostage for job; arrested|Greater Noida|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|A 32-year-old man was arrested for allegedly barging into an NTPC engineer’s house and keeping his family — wife and daughter — hostage at gunpoint for 20 minutes in the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) township at Jarcha, Greater Noida. The police said the man was agitated because he wanted his job back as a contract lineman in NTPC which he had lost after a fight with the victim, Rajesh Kumar Rai, a year ago. The accused identified as Karmveer, 32, belonging to Chauna village in Jarcha, also lived at the NTPC township in Greater Noida with his wife and children.

I begged him to calm down and asked my colleagues for help while I ran towards home,” said Mr. Rai. Around 20 minutes into the incident, the police reached the spot and rescued the family after receiving a call about the incident. “The man had kept the gun pointed at his [Mr. Rai’s] daughter when I peeped in from the window. I asked the girl to lie down while I jumped on Karmveer and snatched his countrymade pistol,” said Jarcha Station House Officer Prabhat Dixit. He further added that the accused was allotted a service quarter in the NTPC township because his father also worked at NTPC, “Further questioning revealed that the accused harboured a grudge against the engineer after he lost his job which is why he had thought that he would threaten the victim to help him get back his job,” Mr. Dixit added. Sent to jail The accused was booked under Sections 452 (house trespass after preparation for hurt), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation), 307 (attempt to murder), 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement) alone with section 7 of Criminal Law Amendment Act of the Indian Penal Code. “The accused was sent to jail after being produced in the court,” Mr. Dixit added.

Harish Rao tells students to aim high|SIDDIPET|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|MLA and former minister T. Harish Rao called upon students to aim high and not rest till the target is achieved, however difficult it may be. He suggested they get inspiration from alumni of the hostel who succeeded in life. For the past 13 years, Mr. Rao has been holding New Year celebrations with students in the Sidddipet Degree College Hostel and this was the 14th. ‘Parents happy’ “Telangana is the only State in the country which has been offering fine rice for students. The government is also extending a grant of Rs. 40 lakh for students who are studying abroad. You can achieve anything if you work hard to achieve that and your parents must be proud of you. I will be happy as a family member if you got a job,” he said while interacting with students. He also suggested not to get disappointed with small failures and work with dedication. Informing that SC, ST and BC study circle was established in the district headquarters, Mr. Rao advised the students to make its best possible use to crack recruitment tests. Referring to the achievement of Telangana by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao after toiling for 14 years and his achievement of getting one lakh majority in elections, Harish Rao said that this was made possible only after aiming high and working hard to achieve that target. Earlier, he cut a cake and distributed it among the students.

‘Boy was excited about his birthday’|NEW DELHI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Family of the 10-year-old boy who succumbed to bullet injuries suffered during a celebratory firing in New Usmanpur was gearing up for his birthday celebration this month and he was very excited for the same, they said. Standing outside the mortuary of Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, victim Rihan Malik’s uncle Mustafa Ahmad said that the boy was excited for his birthday on January 14. “There used to be a small get together and he would buy new clothes just like kids do. His friends were called for the birthday. This new year has started on such a bad note for us,” he said. Inconsolable and sitting inside a car, Rihan’s father Yasin Malik recalled the last conversation he had with his son on Monday afternoon. “He was asking for a muffler for a few days. Yesterday, we went and bought him a muffler. My son used to dress up like a hero,” he said. A neighbour who did not wish to be identified and was with the family at the mortuary remembered the victim as a helping child who never said no to any work.  ‘Helped everyone’ “In our entire street, whoever asked him [Rihan] for any help, he would happily do and never deny,” he said. Rihan is survived by his parents and three brothers including two elder brothers and one younger.|0|
Part of Phase-III of Barapullah flyover project nears completion, to be opened soon|New Delhi|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Seamless connectivity to south Delhi may remain a distant dream for commuters beginning their journey from Mayur Vihar but partial respite is in order for drivers heading from Noida border till Akshardham temple. The Public Works Department (PWD) is giving finishing touches to an 800-metre-long flyover, which is a crucial component of the Barapullah Phase III project. It will provide a signal-free passage between Mayur Vihar and Akshardham temple by early 2020. The project was supposed to be completed by October 2017. Tentative date A dispute related to the acquisition of land on the Yamuna floodplains, however, continues to stall the extension of the project till Sarai Kale Khan. “We have asked the company executing the construction of the project for a tentative date by when finishing touches on the flyover will be completed. We have been assured that the process will take two to three days at the most,” said a government source. ‘Within 15 days’ “After final touches and completion of related modalities, the project should be ready to be thrown open to the public within 15 days and may be inaugurated later this month,” the source said, adding that the flyover will translate into immediate respite for commuters who currently confront congestion at a point below Mayur Vihar Extension metro station. The flyover will allow commuters to travel signal-free from Noida border to Akshardham within 15 to 20 minutes. By segregating traffic headed towards NH-24 below it, the flyover will lead to relatively less congestion during peak commuting time, said the source. Unfortunately, the government has not yet been able to prevail upon the farmers who own around 10 acres of land on the Yamuna floodplains where three pillars needed for extension of the flyover to Sarai Kale Khan are required to be constructed, the source added. These pillars, which are meant to support around 3.5-km of the 10-km-long flyover being constructed at a cost of Rs. 964 crore between Mayur Vihar and Sarai Kale Khan, happen to fall on an estimated eight-acre swathe of private land, whose owners were demanding Rs. 7 crore per acre from the Delhi government as compensation. The Barapullah corridor includes four separate phases. It is intended as a signal-free corridor dedicated to commuters travelling between east Delhi and Indira Gandhi International Airport with a ripple effect on easing congestion across the city.|0|
Govt approves plan to revamp seven busiest bus terminals|New Delhi|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Delhi government on Tuesday said it has given its approval for modernisation of seven of the busiest bus terminals in the Capital to ensure “world-class transit experience” for commuters. A government release stated that the Transport Department, which has already floated a tender for the modernisation of the Nehru Place Bus Terminal, would also float tenders for the Najafgarh and Azadpur bus terminals within a week, followed by tenders for four more terminals, expected to be released in February. “Bus terminals in Delhi have been neglected for decades and the convenience and comfort of bus commuters often ignored. The present terminals do not incorporate basic public amenities such as waiting areas, water and toilet facilities, and pick-up and drop-off points. Also, the spaces are poorly lit and shelters are few and far between, which deter women, young and aged passengers and differently abled commuters from using the terminals,” Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot said. “Bus commuters should get the same experience that airport and metro train commuters get. Only then will there be pride and universal adoption of public buses in Delhi,” he said. Almost 40% of trips in Delhi were made through public buses, evidencing the fact that bus terminals were crucial nodes of interchange, the statement read. The government stated that the present bus terminals suffered from “deficiencies” such as traffic disorder at entry and exit points, inaccessibility for para-transit services, and informal shops and kiosks along boundary walls adding to congestion. As per its vision to remedy the situation, the government said it wanted to create bus stations where bills can be paid, families can wait during a long commute near locker rooms for luggage, and commuters can visit a Mohalla Clinic for a quick consultation, or have a drink at water ATMs. These terminals, the government said, would also be designed with provisions for notification of bus arrival and departure times, using GPS, and smart navigation and way-finding equipment.|0|

Over 500 booked for drunk driving on New Year’s Eve|New Delhi|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Over 500 people were booked for drunk driving on New Year’s Eve, the police said on Tuesday. The number has decreased from 765 in 2017. The police said 509 people were penalised for drunk driving out of which 362 were drivers of the vehicle and the rest were owners. In 2017, a total of 765 people were booked for the crime out of which 543 were drivers and 222 were owners. The decline in numbers is perhaps because of the various awareness campaigns that were rolled out before the New Year’s Eve, the police said. “Posters showing accidents due to drunk driving were put up. Messages on the radio asked people to go with drivers instead of driving themselves after getting drunk,” said a police officer. 15,000 personnel They also had a no-tolerance policy toward drunk driving and about 15,000 personnel were deployed to ensure law and order. Elaborate traffic arrangements were also made across the Capital to ensure smooth movement.|0|

Jail terms upheld in 2 drunken driving cases|New Delhi|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|A Delhi court has upheld 15 and four days’ simple imprisonment to two persons respectively in separate drunk driving cases, saying that “this offence should be dealt with severely”. In one of the cases, the breathalyser found 606 ml of alcohol per 100 ml of blood in a two-wheeler rider, while the other offender who was riding a scooter was found to have consumed 347 ml of alcohol per 100 ml of blood. Pleas rejected In the case of the accused awarded the 15-day term, his counsel sought setting aside of the imprisonment submitting that he is a patient suffering from liver disease, while the counsel for the other accused pleaded for waiving the four-day jail term, arguing that he was not explained the extent of imprisonment as he was unable to get proper legal assistance. However, Special Judge Jitendra Kumar Mishra rejected their appeals and upheld the jail terms awarded by the Metropolitan Magistrate courts. “The appellants were found driving the vehicles under the influence of liquor and [the] alcohol content was 347.5 ml/100 ml and 606 ml/100 ml respectively, which is much higher than the prescribed limit, that is, 30 ml/100 ml,” the judge said. “This court is conscious to the suffering being suffered by society due to drunken driving. Seeing the impact of drunken driving upon the road users, who are none other than the common people, it is necessary that this offence should be dealt with severely,” the judge stated. “In view of the observations made here in above, this court is of the considered view that the grounds taken by the appellants in the appeals are not sustainable. Rather, there is no infirmity in the orders passed by the trial court in view of the offence committed by accused/appellants. Accordingly, present appeals are dismissed,” the judge further said.

Large crowds choke metro, exit gates at 4 stations forced to shut|NEW DELHI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Exit gates of four major metro stations in the city were closed due to heavy footfall in Central Delhi on Tuesday. The police and metro officials said the gates were closed as a crowd control measure. “As per instructions from the police, exits at four metro stations — Central Secretariat, Udyog Bhawan, Mandi House and Pragati Maidan — were blocked with immediate effect around afternoon due to a swelling crowd. The gates were opened around 7.28 p.m.,” said a Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) official. Pre-decided Deputy Commissioner of Police (New Delhi) Madhur Verma said, “Last year, Delhi was gridlocked for several hours on January 1. The pattern from last year was studied and it was already decided that exit points of these metro stations will be closed for a few hours to control the crowd,” he said referring to a meeting between local police, traffic police and metro police before the New Year’s Eve. The officer said the traffic remained largely manageable through the day in New Delhi. “The local police assisted the traffic officers. Lakhs of people came to India Gate for New Year celebration and the number had reached about one lakh at a time around 3 p.m.,” he said. Unable to enter the metro stations closest to India Gate or National Zoological Park, both of which saw a high footfall, passengers were forced to walk to several other stations. “We had come to India Gate in the afternoon and since 5 p.m. we have been trying to head home. For two hours, we have been unable to find a cab. We have been walking since then and are now headed to ITO metro station, where hopefully we will be able to board the train,” Suraj, a government employee headed towards GTB Nagar. For Seema Rawat, the day-out with her friends and five children turned out to be a trying one after the group failed to find any public transport for over two hours. “We have been looking for transport to go to Kashmere Gate since 4.30 p.m. Initially we walked to the Pragati Maidan station but there is a huge crowd outside the station. Then we went to the ITO metro station. Even the buses are not stopping,” said Ms. Rawat. Twitter updates The Traffic Police was also updating the information on Twitter asking people to avoid certain routes near Connaught Place due to heavy pedestrian movement. They also tweeted about the closing of entry at National Zoological Park at 4 p.m. to control the crowd.|0|
Woman can seek maintenance at any time after separation: HC|New Delhi|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Delhi High Court has in a recent judgment said that there is no bar in law against women claiming maintenance for themselves or for their children even if they have not claimed it in the initial years after separation. Justice Mukta Gupta said that “non-providing of maintenance was a continuing cause of action”, and there were no time period limitations for claiming it under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence (PWDV) Act. “Non-providing of maintenance is a continuous cause of action and even if for three years the respondent no. 2 [wife] did not claim the maintenance for herself or for the child, the same would not debar her from seeking maintenance under Section 12 of the PWDV Act,” the judge said. The High Court also dismissed the plea of the husband to quash an FIR filed against him by the wife for subjecting her to cruelty. The husband had argued that the FIR was registered to wreak vengeance and that it was beyond the period of limitation as the parties separated from each other in the year 2014. Period of limitation He relied on Section 468 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which says that there is a bar on courts taking cognizance of a crime after lapse of the period of limitation. If the offence is punishable with imprisonment for one to three years, the period of limitation is three years. But the wife argued that they resided together till August 2014 and in 2015 she filed a complaint before the Crime Against Women (CAW) cell where a settlement was arrived at between them in the pre-litigation mediation in April, 2016. However, the said settlement was not fully acted upon and the parties drifted away from the settlement. Later the wife filed an application for revival of the earlier complaint which was not revived as it had been closed, hence she filed a fresh complaint in July 2017. The court noted that since the earlier complaint was not revived, the wife was constrained to file the second complaint. “It cannot be said that the FIR in question is beyond the period of limitation and thus liable to be quashed on that count,” it said.|0|

The 150-metre ordeal between railway and metro stations|New Delhi|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|With the Lajpat Nagar-Mayur Vihar Pocket 1 corridor of the Pink Line becoming operational, the commute between south and east Delhi has become easy and quick for many. However, there are still a few hurdles that commuters have to face while travelling on the line. While the newly opened 9.7-km corridor has provided commuters a metro station at Hazrat Nizamuddin, the walk to and from the Hazrat Nizamuddin railway station involves navigating through heavy traffic and scores of hawkers lined up along the road. The Hazrat Nizamuddin metro station has been touted as a “major transit hub” owing to its proximity to the Sarai Kale Khan ISBT and the Hazrat Nizamuddin railway station. A day after its opening, several passengers were seen taking the metro to reach the railway station. However, the approximately 150-metre walk between the two stations proved to be a hurdle for many, especially for those with heavy luggage and children. With pavements completely out of bounds due to the presence of innumerable vending carts, the road leading to the railway station had vendors competing with vehicles for space. “While the opening of the metro station here is a boon for us, we did not realise that there was no space to walk to the metro station. It was quite difficult for us, especially because we have small children and lots of luggage,” said Sunanda Kumar, waiting at the railway station with a family of five. When asked, the street vendors said that due to drains and unhygienic conditions next to the pavements, they had no other option but sell on the road itself. “There was initially a parking lot where we used to sit, but now it no longer exists... we were asked to shift to the pavements, but we cannot move there as it is very dirty and we will not get any customers. Who would want to cross the dirt and muck to buy food,” asked Sujan Yadav, from Bihar, who has been in the area for over 25 years. Missing link Another hurdle for commuters has been the incomplete section between Trilokpuri and Mayur Vihar Pocket 1. Due to the ongoing land dispute on the 1.4-km stretch, Majlis Park and Shiv Vihar are not yet connected completely. While commuters can travel from the Majlis Park end to Mayur Vihar Pocket 1, passengers on the Shiv Vihar side can only travel up to Trilokpuri while travelling on the Pink Line.|0|
BJYM leader, 100 others booked for ‘rioting’ in Greater Noida|Greater Noida|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Badalpur police on Tuesday booked district president of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) Annu Pandit and 100 other unidentified men for alleged rioting at the UPPCL block office at Badalpur in Greater Noida on December 31. The police said Mr. Annu Pandit along with two others — Atul Pandit and Raj Nagar — allegedly barged into the office of Sanjay Kumar Sharma, Sub-Divisional Officer, UPPCL, to settle a power theft complaint while he was attending a meeting. The accused allegedly snatched their mobile phones and kept them as hostages for the next three hours, said the police. “The men entered my office and started threatening us with dire consequences if we didn’t heed to their demands.They held us hostage for around three hours till one of the staffers alerted the police,” said Mr. Sharma. The accused had allegedly barged into the office to settle an electricity theft complaint filed by the UPPCL against a resident of Accheja village in Dadri. “We had filed an electricity theft complaint against a man called Mahender, the owner of the house from where the theft was reported in April 2017. Over the matter Pandit threatened that he and his men will tear our clothes and humiliate us,” Mr. Sharma added. Dadri Station House Officer Nagender Chaubey said they have registered a case against Annu Pandit, Atul Pandit, Raj Nagar and 100 other unidentified men on the basis of a complaint by the officials. “An FIR was registered under Sections 147, 342, 363, 427, 504 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code for rioting, wrongful confinement, kidnapping, mischief, intention to insult and criminal intimidation,” said Mr. Chaubey. Brushing aside the allegations, the BJYM president said the officials had sent inflated electricity bills to the people and when they approached the officials their grievances were not addressed. “I went to the office to amicably settle the issue in the presence of the police. The allegations are false,” he said.  The men entered my office and started threatening us with dire consequences if we didn’t heed to their demands.They held us hostage for around three hours till one of the staffers alerted the police  Sanjay Kumar Sharma  Sub-Divisional Officer, UPPCL|0|

Govt notifies rules to enable PwD access to education, jobs|New Delhi|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Rules formulated under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, have been notified by the Delhi government, giving persons with disabilities (PwD) better access to education, healthcare and employment. The Delhi Rights of Persons with Disabilities Rules, 2018, were notified by the Social Welfare Department on December 27, a statement from Social Welfare Minister Rajendra Pal Gautam said on Tuesday. ‘New Year gift’ Terming it a “New Year gift” for PwD, the Minister said the reason for the delay in notifying the rules was that Delhi was not categorised as a “State” in the rules so the government had to get clearance from the Lieutenant-Governor to approach the Union Ministry of Home Affairs. “Section 101 of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, confers power upon the State government to make such rules under the said act. However, the term, ‘State government’ has not been defined in the RPwD Act, 2016,” the statement read. Special powers The Delhi government had to seek a special delegation of powers to formulate the rules, the statement added. “However, since the notification is done, now the differently-abled can avail the benefits and concessions in education, health services, loan facilities, jobs and any such governmental schemes,” the statement read. The new rules lay down procedures for workplaces to handle complaints of discrimination on the basis of disability, reservation of jobs, research on disability and ensuring equal opportunity.|0|
Five arrested for rape|GURUGRAM|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Five persons have been arrested for allegedly raping a widow in Manesar here this past week. The 45-year-old woman, a resident of Delhi, had come to Gurugram on December 29 afternoon to settle financial issues with a private firm in Manesar, where her husband worked as a contractor, when the incident took place.

Govt delaying metro Phase-IV, says Tiwari|New Delhi|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government is “betraying the people” of the Capital by hindering the Delhi Metro’s Phase-IV through addition of “new conditions” related to its financing, the city unit of the BJP said on Tuesday. Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari said that new conditions related to the project, which had been conveyed by the AAP government to the Centre, were being imposed by the Arvind Kejriwal-led government, resulting in further delay for the long-pending project. ‘Two new conditions’ “The Delhi government has added two conditions connected with the sharing of operational loss and liability to pay loan from outside... it is now demanding that the operational loss be borne equally by the Centre and the Delhi government,” Mr. Tiwari said. “Besides, the Delhi government has added one more condition... that if the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) is unable to repay the loan, the Delhi government will not pay any outside loan,” he said. The North East Delhi MP alleged that Mr. Kejriwal was “deliberately” delaying the project so that the Centre could be accused for it and he “may be able to get cheap popularity in the media”. Through such tactics, Mr. Tiwari said, Mr. Kejriwal is “working against the interest of the people of Delhi”. “By providing connectivity to the remote rural areas of Delhi... the people will get great relief, but the AAP has not forgotten its defeat in the municipal elections and is taking revenge on the people of Delhi,” he claimed.|0|

However, they only came to know about the incident after he did not return for 10 minutes and they went to check on him.

‘Address locals’ concerns on Nanar oil refinery’|Mumbai|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|India’s biggest oil refinery project entailing an investment of Rs. 3 lakh crore, proposed to come up in Ratnagiri, should not be pushed through without addressing concerns of locals and conducting a social impact assessment, a parliamentary panel has said. The Committee on Government Assurances in the Rajya Sabha, whose latest report was tabled in Parliament on Monday, had taken up the issue regarding the setting up of the refinery during its study visit to Mumbai. Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Dharmendra Pradhan had earlier informed the Upper House that Engineers India Limited was carrying out a detailed feasibility study. The committee said that locals’ concerns cannot be brushed aside. Though it observed that developmental projects are necessary, the Committee directed representatives of the Ratnagiri Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited (RRPCL) to carry out a social impact assessment and intensify mass outreach programmes to address locals’ concerns. Three Indian oil firms signed a Memorandum of Understanding on April 11, 2018 with Saudi Aramco, the State-owned oil company of Saudi Arabia, to develop the refinery. While the Union Cabinet cleared Aramco’s investment, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis after initially backing the project, took a step back in the winter session of the Assembly, stating there will be no land acquisition for the project, owing to ongoing agitation from locals and opposition from BJP’s ally Shiv Sena. Three months ago, Sena leader and Industries Minister Subhash Desai announced in Ratnagiri that a government notification for acquiring land stood cancelled. This was negated by Mr. Fadnavis. Locals question logic Residents have asked how a public outreach program was held after the project has been notified and land for it earmarked for industrial use. “Shouldn’t such programs be held before bringing the project in our area? The RRPCL is presently going on an over-drive for publicity through junkets, sponsorship, and advertisements. We have clarified that first drop this project from Nanar and then we will listen to ad campaigns,” said Satyajit Chavan, convener, Konkan Refinery Prakalp Virodhi Sangharsh Sanghatana. Mr. Chavan said that the CM’s announcement to stop land acquisition was a diversionary tactic. “This process is on halt from the last one year. The real issue is that farm lands are being declared as industrial under the notification by the State’s Industry department. We want this notification to be quashed. Dialogue is possible only after that,” he said. The function of the assurance committee is to scrutinise the promises given by the Minister on the floor of the house during Question Hour as also during discussion on Bills, Resolutions, Motions, Calling Attention notices. It reports to the house on the extent to which those have been implemented and time frame. Pune Airport The Committee has also observed that the development of a new civilian airport at Pune has already been delayed and hoped for no further hurdles. It has recommended that the Union Civil Aviation Ministry should expedite necessary clearances. Last month, Mr. Fadnavis approved the appointment of a consultant for the development plan of the proposed greenfield airport. In a meeting with Maharashtra Airport Development Corporation, a decision was also taken to set up a project management office for it.  Shouldn’t [public outreach] programs be held before bringing the project in our area?Satyajit ChavanConvener, Konkan Refinery Prakalp Virodhi Sangharsh Sanghatana|0|
Uproar on cancelling reservation of 6 plots|Mumbai|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|What is the Shiv Sena’s stand on open spaces in Mumbai? On one hand, it retracted its proposal to delete an open space reservation after uproar in the BMC last month while on the other, it has done the same thing again. It has rejected proposals to acquire six plots for various amenities worth around Rs. 200 crore in Monday’s BMC Improvement Committee meeting as they are encumbered. Opposition parties have written to the Municipal Commissioner once again to reverse the decision. Shiv Sena in BMC last month called for deletion of the reservation of a 2,000 sq. metre plot in Kurla west in the development plan for a recreational ground. Sena corporator Anant Nar moved a proposal in a general assembly meeting that the reservation not be pursued as the land was completely encroached upon. The Opposition created an uproar and in the next few days the Sena reversed the decision. The Improvement Committee rejected six proposals on the acquisition of plots in Kandivali and Goregaon ranging between 2,000 and 11,000 sq. metre. Reserved for schools, playgrounds and DP roads, five are owned by M/s Bombay Real Estate Development Company Pvt. Ltd. Together, they cost around Rs. 200 crore. Leader of Opposition in BMC Ravi Raja said, “The Shiv Sena is selling off Mumbai one by one. Why was the meeting kept on December 31 and proposal circulated in the last minute? This means they had carefully planned this. Together, the market value of these plots is in thousands of crores. The Sena wants to deprive Mumbaikars of these amenities. If the plots are encumbered, the administration will look at ways of developing them. This is an exact repeat of the Kurla plot.”  Reservation retained BJP corporator Prakash Gangadhare also opposed the move on the floor of the committee. “These reservations have been retained in the new DP as well. That means the administration knows about the encroachments and still wants to pursue acquisition. Then why is the Shiv Sena opposing development?” he asked. The proposals were rejected by the majority as Mr. Gangadhare alleged that there was no voting. Sena corporator Shraddha Jadhav, who had moved for rejection, said, “In past years, of all the plots acquired by BMC, has a single one been developed? These plots are completely encroached upon. Why should we waste public money over them? We will spend, provided they are developed.” Ms. Jadhav said in case of encumbered plots, owners should rehabilitate encroachers or the administration should come out with a policy for such plots. However, proposals for plots that are not encroached upon have been passed in the meeting. 216 acquired plots Defending the move, Improvement Committee chairman Dilip Lande said, “The matter was discussed for at least half-an-hour. About 216 such plots have been acquired so far but none developed. We are not opposed to acquisition, this is for the people after all. But the BMC should force the developer to rehabilitate slum dwellers and give the rest of the plot to us, as per law. Administration should present a revised proposal before the committee.” When asked why the Sena is changing its stance, Mr. Lande said that the party wants all Mumbaikars get every amenity and that this is merely a move to bring a revised proposal back.|0|

The BMC had found unauthorised rooftop seating at Bar Stock Exchange on Saturday, which had then been removed. But the civic body found repeat violations on Monday night. For the past month, the civic body has intensified inspections of residential and commercial premises for fire safety violations. The drive followed instructions from the municipal commissioner for a joint inspection by BMC and fire brigade ahead of the first anniversary of Kamala Mills tragedy and New Year’s Eve. In four days up to Monday evening, the teams had inspected 377 establishments across 24 wards, and found violations in 31, including encroachment or obstacles to the fire exit and excessive storage of LPG cylinders.

Manager of Union Bank held for fraud|Mumbai|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Sewree police have arrested a chief manager with the Union Bank of India for allegedly defrauding the bank of more than Rs. 30 lakh over three years. According to the police, Nabarun Muzumdar (49) was posted as chief manager with the credit card department of the bank’s Reay Road branch since 2015, and is alleged to have perpetrated the fraud since then. Files changed “According to the complaint by senior bank officials in December, Mr. Muzumdar, in his capacity as the chief manager of the credit card department, had access to details of all payments made by customers against their credit card dues. Every time a customer made a payment, a file would be generated, which was editable. Mr. Muzumdar would manipulate the bank records to reflect that some of his own credit card dues had also been settled from the customer’s account. This would decrease his dues in the bank records, while the bank would not get a single rupee in payment against his dues,” Assistant Commissioner of Police Santosh Walke, Wadala division. said. Mr. Walke said that from 2015 to 2018, Mr. Muzumdar defrauded the bank of Rs. 34 lakh, and the fraud only came to light in December last year during an internal audit by the bank. An FIR was subsequently filed against Mr. Muzumdar on December 20, while he allegedly went on the run. Inquiries in Kolkata “Our team conducted inquiries in Mr. Muzumdar’s hometown, Kolkata, for several days before learning that he was staying in a lodge in Goregaon. He was arrested from there five days ago,” Mr. Walke said. He has been charged with cheating, criminal breach of trust by public servant, banker or merchant and forgery of valuable security under the Indian Penal Code and sections of the Information Technology Act. A court has remanded him in police custody till January 3, police officers said.|0|
Now, mental health support is just a text away|Mumbai|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|For people grappling with mental health problems, help will soon be only a text message away. The Vandrevala Foundation, a non-profit which started the city’s first 24x7 mental health helpline, will soon open a text messaging service, which will offer counselling through SMS and WhatsApp messages. The software and logistics for the ‘text helpline’ are in the final stages and the service is likely to begin in February. Dr. Arun John, executive vice-president of the foundation, said, “When it comes to discussing mental health issues, it takes a lot of courage to talk about it. There are many people who freeze when counsellors pick up their call. At times, they are not calling from a conducive setting. A parent or a relative may have stepped into their room or there may be some other reason why they cannot talk freely on the phone. This is why we thought of having a crisis intervention text helpline, where the person in need can seek help in comfort. By doing an analysis of our calls, we have learned that most of the callers are in the 18 to 35 age group, who are very savvy with text messaging.” The Vandrevala Foundation’s mental health helpline was operating from the city till 2015. The base was then shifted to Gujarat and expanded to two toll-free numbers: 18602662345 and 18002333330. Sixteen counsellors attend to the calls round-the-clock and the helplines, on an average, receive 80 calls. During the exam season, the helplines receives nearly 300 calls a day. Dr. John said, “Our teams have been working on activating the messaging service using the same helpline numbers. All logistics are being worked out and more than 90% of the work is done.” Many mental health professionals keep in touch with their patients through text messages. Counselling through online chats is also catching up. Psychiatrist Dr. Harish Shetty, who uses WhatsApp to regularly keep in touch with his patients, said, “Text messaging feels non-threatening to people. One can text from anywhere and there are no limitations. There is also less probability of someone overhearing the conversation. Counselling through texts reduces the fear factor drastically. Helplines in our country are largely underutilised. People have to embrace this avenue for seeking help. Hopefully, text counselling will catch up faster.” Expansion plans Dr. John said they plan to provide counselling services in south Indian languages as they receive many calls from the region. He said, “Language becomes a problem at times. If we expand, we can employ counsellors who can speak the local languages.” Dr. John said the telephone bills of the helpline are massive and they have been reaching out to companies who can help through their Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives. He said, “If we get help to at least cover the salaries of the counsellors, we can expand the service across the country.”|0|
Governor to VC: probe delay in replying to RTI activist’s queries|Mumbai|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Governor Ch. Vidyasagar Rao has asked the Vice Chancellor (VC) of the Mumbai University (MU) to look into the delay in replying to the queries posed by a Right to Information (RTI) activist. Last week, RTI activist Aakash Vedak had written to the Governor, who is also MU’s Chancellor, seeking a response from the varsity to the information he had sought under provisions of the RTI Act. The Governor’s secretary has directed the VC to “directly communicate” to the activist the action taken by the university on the matter, which dates back to October 2017. Mr. Vedak, a law student, had sought information on the income earned and expenditure incurred by the university through re-evaluation and photocopying of answer sheets. The university provided information on the income after Mr. Vedak filed an appeal with the State Information Commission (SIC) in December 2017. However, the university did not provide any information on the expenditure. Then Mr. Vedak filed a second appeal and the SIC in its verdict in April 2018 ordered the MU public information officer to give information about the expenditure by April 28. When the university failed to comply with the order, the activist complained to the SIC again in May. Then the SIC fined the university Rs. 25,000 and set December 10 as the deadline to provide the information. When the university failed to meet the deadline again, Mr. Vedak knocked on the Governor’s door on December 18. Mr. Vedak said, “The matter has just been transferred. I was expecting the Governor to respond firmly, but I am glad that he has taken cognisance of the matter. I am hoping that at least now the university shows the courtesy to provide the information.” In late December, the university approached the SIC and appealed it to review the matter. The SIC has scheduled a hearing into the review appeal on January 18. Mr. Vinod Malale, public relations officer of MU, said, “We had filed a review appeal with the SIC in December. They have given us an opportunity in January. The authorities concerned will give the appropriate response and details to the State Information Commissioner on the set date.”  We will give the appropriate response to the SIC on the set date Vinod Malale Public relations officer of MU|0|
Parliamentary panel raps State govt. for salt pan land stalemate|Mumbai|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Rajya Sabha’s Committee on Government Assurances has expressed concerns over the delay in Maharashtra’s efforts to unlock Mumbai’s large salt pan land tracts for projects such as affordable housing. The committee has urged the Union Commerce and Industry Ministry, that is entrusted with the salt pan lands, to take up the matter for expeditious resolution with Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis. However, the CM toldThe Hinduthat the decision on salt pan lands is pending with the Centre, not the State. “As far we are concerned, the salt pan land decision is pending with the Central government and not with the State,” Mr. Fadnavis said. The CM had, in 2014, said that 600 acres of the salt pan land would be freed up for building affordable homes. ‘Strange delay’ The committee had examined the issue regarding transfer of salt pan lands of Mumbai during a study visit to the city, as an assurance had been given on the matter by the Union Commerce Minister as far back as March 2014, when the UPA government was in power. The Centre had informed Parliament at the time that it had asked the State administration to submit a substantive proposal for transferring the salt pan lands in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region to the State government for affordable housing projects. The representatives of the State government had informed the committee during its visit that the State’s response “had been delayed since mapping of wetlands was being undertaken” and the proposal would be sent to the Central Ministry after preparing the new Master Plan for Mumbai. Expressing concern over the delay in fulfilment of the assurance, the panel has said it was “strange as to why the State government is not expediting necessary steps and sending its reply regarding market plan, etc. to take the matter forward, despite the fact that the proposal could unlock much needed spare land for housing and other developmental activities in Mumbai where the land is scarce”. The report of the committee, which keeps track of assurances given by ministers on the floor of the Upper House while replying to queries from parliamentarians, was presented on Monday. New formula? State government officials said the Maharashtra government has reworked the formula for sharing of the nearly 1,000 acres of salt pan land with the central government. A utilisation plan and sharing formula have been forwarded to the Centre in order to secure its nod for for allowing development of the land for affordable housing in the space-starved city. Much of the land in question is, in fact, encroached upon. A 2016 survey of the Mumbai Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (MMRDA) found most of the salt pans in Mumbai are encroached upon by slums and illegal structures. Barely 25 acres of the total land is available for development, the survey had found. The officials of the State Urban Development Department said the encroachment of salt pan land is an issue they are not handling. “That issue (salt pans) is the prerogative of the Revenue Department,” Nitin Kareer, principal secretary in the department said. Another issue related to the ownership of the land has been resolved, said senior State government officials. Revenue Minister Chandrakant Patil has already adjudicated on the matter of ownership of the salt pan parcels, which are jointly owned by the State and Central governments as per the ruling of the Konkan Divisional Commissioner. The ownership report was earlier disputed by the Deputy Salt Commissioner, who had petitioned the Revenue Minister on the same. “The final adjudication on the ownership was declared by the honourable Revenue Minister a month ago,” Rajendra Kshirsagar, deputy secretary in the State Revenue Department, said.|0|

Overspeeding cases soar to 7.8 lakh in 2018|Mumbai|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Thanks to high-tech speed cameras installed in the city in 2017, the number of overspeeding cases registered by the Mumbai Traffic Police accelerated from around 25,000 in 2017 to a whopping 7.8 lakh in 2018, traffic officials said. On New Year’s Eve on Monday, the traffic police registered 455 cases of drunk driving and 1,114 offences of overspeeding and rash driving combined. The Hinduhad reported in April last year that the traffic police had registered a record 80,000 cases in just the first three months. Officials credit this rise in numbers to the installation of speed cameras, which capture licence plate numbers of speeding vehicles and generate e-challans to the errant drivers. The cameras, equipped with Automated Number Plate Recognition technology, went operational on New Year’s Eve in 2017. Joint Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Amitesh Kumar said, “As opposed to the 25,000-odd cases that we registered in the previous year, we have in 2018 registered 7.8 lakh cases. While earlier we were relying on our personnel and speed guns, the speed cameras have provided a shot in the arm to our efforts to crack down on traffic rules violations and decrease fatalities. We observed a 25% decrease in road fatalities last year as compared to 2017, and a 35% decline as compared to 2016.” Tackling danger zones Mr. Kumar said the decrease in fatalities could not be attributed to the speed cameras alone, and that increased awareness among motorists and black spot identification — an approach where the police identified and focused on accident-prone spots — had also contributed to bringing down the figure. “We identified 52 black spots and worked towards eliminating the risk of accidents. While at some spots we installed speed cameras, in others we made structural changes or deployed additional personnel. We also observed that there was a surge in overspeeding cases in the initial months of 2018, and as people learned about the cameras and prompt action against violations, the number witnessed a slight decline,” Mr. Kumar said. The traffic police also attributed the decline in the number of drunk driving cases to sustained action by the police and increased awareness among motorists. While there were 615 cases of drunk driving registered in 2017, the police registered 455 cases on Monday. Officers said the State government’s recent order announcing a six-month suspension of licences of those caught driving under the influence also played a part in the decreased numbers. “We have sent proposals seeking suspension of the licences of all 455 offenders to the Regional Transport Offices concerned,” Mr. Kumar said. Action in Navi Mumbai Meanwhile, the Navi Mumbai Traffic Police booked 353 people for drunk driving on New Year’s Eve. “Our officers were stationed at all major points with breath analysers. The maximum cases were registered in Turbhe division,” Deputy Commissioner of Police, Traffic, Sunil Lokhande said. Around 48 people were caught drunk driving in Turbhe, 47 in Vashi, 38 in Kalmboli, 29 each in Koparkhairne and Mahape, 23 each in Rabale and Panvel, 21 in New Panvel, 19 each in Kharghar and Taloja, 16 in APMC, 15 in CBD Belapur, eight in Gavanfata, seven each in Uran and Nhava Sheva and four in Seawood. The Navi Mumbai Police, too, acted against various offenders on Monday night. Zone I officials arrested four people, two for consuming alcohol in a public place and two for using obscene words in public. “We have booked 189 people under the Motor Vehicles Act and Maharashtra Police Act for various offences,” Deputy Commissioner of Police, Zone I, Sudhakar Pathare said. Of these, 176 were booked for driving under the influence, while six were booked for misbehaviour, obstructing roads and annoyance in a public place. Zone II officials. meanwhile, booked 137 people for drunk driving, 18 for breaking traffic rules, 26 for creating nuisance in public place and six for consuming alcohol in a public place. In an incident of road rage, CBD Belapur resident Atif Saleem Shaikh (26) was attacked by unidentified men around 3 a.m. on Tuesday. Mr. Shaikh is undergoing treatment at MGM Hospital and a case against four people has been registered with the NRI coastal police. — With inputs from Raina Assainar|0|
Lab tests at cheap rates: BMC finalises contractors|Mumbai|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has found contractors for its Aapli Chikitsa programme aimed at providing patients at civic-run hospitals with basic and advanced pathology tests at subsidised rates. Metropolis and Thyrocare have been finalised as the contractors and the BMC will spend Rs. 79 crore on a four-year contract. The proposal, which will be tabled before the standing committee on Wednesday, is likely to face resistance as the programme was initially meant to provide the tests for free, with the BMC bearing the cost. The programme is aimed at reducing the load on municipal hospitals and providing quality services at affordable rates. A health department officer said, “Not all municipal hospitals conduct advanced tests. Patients have to then pay exorbitant fees at private labs. Now, we are giving them the same tests at cheaper rates.” The programme will cover 101 tests for dengue, malaria, diabetes, thyroid, leptospirosis for just Rs. 100. Advanced tests will cost Rs. 200. The lab attendants will take samples from municipal hospitals and send reports in the stipulated time. The programme will cover 25 hospitals, 175 clinics and 28 maternity centres.|0|
Israel’s Opposition splits ahead of election in April|Jerusalem|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Israel’s centre-left opposition dramatically split on Tuesday ahead of an April 9 election, with leader Avi Gabbay announcing that he would no longer partner with veteran politician Tzipi Livni as she sat stone-faced next to him. The announcement means the end of their Zionist Union alliance, which finished with the second most seats in the last general election in 2015 but which has since tumbled in opinion polls. The Zionist Union included Mr. Gabbay’s Labour party and Ms. Livni’s Hatnuah. It won 24 out of 120 seats in 2015, behind Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud, which won 30. Since Mr. Gabbay took over as head of Labour in 2017, his partnership with Ms. Livni had been uneasy and it was unclear if the alliance would continue for the election. ‘Doubts cleared’ In a statement shortly after Mr. Gabbay’s announcement, Ms. Livni said it was “good that the doubts had been cleared”, vowing to focus on winning the upcoming poll. Mr. Gabbay’s decision is the latest realignment ahead of the election and more are expected. Polls show that Mr. Netanyahu is likely to remain prime minister after the elections despite corruption allegations against him.|0|
‘My spirit to help others will never perish’|Mumbai|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Nineteen-year-old Siddharameshwar Hanumant Humanabade remembers the evening of December 17 like it was yesterday. The cries of patients screaming for help from the windows of the ESIC hospital in Andheri continue to ring in his ears even two weeks after the fire, which claimed 11 lives. However, what eases the discomfort is the realisation that he was able to save 10 lives when many had lost hope of making it out alive. Mr. Humanabade, an agent with food delivery app Swiggy, was on Tuesday felicitated by the Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Labour and Employement, Santosh Kumar Gangwar, at a ceremony in New Delhi. He was awarded a cheque of Rs. 1 lakh by the Centre for braving the fire and rescuing 10 patients trapped inside the hospital. Mr. Humanabade requested the government for money to fund his education and a government job to support his family. He said, “I told the minister about my family’s condition and my desire to study further. I asked him if he could fund my education and provide a government job. Though he could not assure anything, he has said that he will try. His assistant has given me his card and has asked me to call in case I need help.” While some patients were rescued by the fire brigade, some jumped out of the building in fear. Eleven people, including a newborn, died in the fire and several others were injured. Mr. Humanabade, who inhaled toxic smoke while rescuing patients, was rushed to Seven Hills Hospital. He was discharged three days later. Speaking toThe Hindushortly after returning to the city on Tuesday, Mr. Humanabade expressed contentment and satisfaction at his bravery, and vowed to never stop helping others. He said, “I know that I could not have saved more that 10 patients. But if I had stood outside like others clicking pictures and shooting videos on my cell phone, I could have never slept in peace.” Mr. Humanabade, who cleared his State Secondary Education exam two years ago, could not pursue his studies owing to poverty. He joined Swiggy 15 days before the incident. He said, “I had to deliver food in the vicinity. As I was passing by the hospital, I saw thick, black smoke. When I went closer, I could see flames raging. Without a second thought, I parked my bike on the roadside and rushed inside.” Seeing people cry out for help, Mr. Humanabade, a native of Karnataka, climbed the ladder placed by the fire brigade. While he was making his way up, two patients jumped from the window. “I became numb when I saw them jump from the building. It happened just before I could reach them. I hurriedly climbed to the fourth-floor ward. One by one, I helped people out. I then opened the door of the ward and used my mobile phone’s flashlight to see if there was anybody there. I then started having difficulty in breathing and decided to step out.” Mr. Humanabade said he did not fear even once during the rescue mission. “All I was focused on were the cries of those patients and their faces. At the back of my mind, I knew they had families. They meant something to somebody,” he said. Emphasising on the need to assist people in hours of distress, Mr. Humanabade said, “There is always a way to help, but we need more selfless helpers. Life is not a joke.” Mr. Humanabade wants to use the money to educate his brother and support his family. He said that his spirit to help others will never perish. “I have been helping people in distress since childhood. I like it when others are happy and when I am able to be of help to someone.” Praising him for his bravery, the ESIC Hospital authorities announced on Tuesday that they will taking care of Mr. Humanabade’s medical expenses. Dr. BB Gupta, medical superintendent of ESIC Hospital, said, “I have been told that the delivery boy acted very bravely that day and helped in evacuating patients when it was not really his job. We recognise his effort. His hospital bills will also be taken care of.” (With inputs from Tanvi Deshpande)  If I had stood outside like others clicking pictures and shooting videos on my cell phone, I could have never slept in peace Siddharameshwar Humanabade Swiggy employee|0|

Below poverty line Sant Rohidas corporation was formed to implement schemes for the uplift of Charmakars (dhor, chambhar, holar, mochi etc.) who are below poverty line. Mahatma Phule corporation provides financial assistance for the economic development of the backward and other backward classes while Lokshahir Anna Bhau Sathe corporation was set up to raise the standard of living of the Matang community. The Maharashtra State Handicapped corporation aims to undertake economic development activities, including self employment, for the benefit of people with disability. “Charmakars and Matangs are key constituents of the Scheduled Caste (SC) population in Maharashtra. While Mahars dominate the discourse around the SCs, these two silent sub-castes have been important for the BJP and the Shiv Sena. These corporations can be used extensively to reach out to this population,” a senior BJP leader from the Cabinet said.|0|

Woman, lover held for husband’s murder|Mumbai|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Kasarwadavli police on Monday arrested a 27-year-old woman and her paramour for the murder of her husband in Thane last month. The police said that the accused brutally murdered the victim while his seven-year-old daughter was sleeping in the next room. The police said, the husband, Gopal Naik (30), was a sweeper with the Thane Municipal Corporation and stayed with his wife Priya (27) and their daughter in the TMC sweepers’ quarters in Gaimukh area. The police said Gopal was brought to the Thane Civil Hospital at 4.15 a.m. on December 29, where he was declared dead before admission. The people who brought him – later identified as Priya and her paramour Mahesh Karale (25) – left immediately after filling in Gopal’s details in the paperwork and telling the hospital staff that he met with an accident. After the post-mortem indicated blunt force trauma to the head, the hospital authorities informed the police about the matter. A team was then sent to the hospital to conduct inquiries. Based on the details in his paperwork, the police visited his house and found the daughter alone. “We saw blood stains on the floor and attempts to clean it up. We were then on the lookout for Priya. The daughter told us she saw her mother talking to Mr. Karale on video chat several times,” senior police inspector Dattatray Dhole said. Facebook friends Mr. Dhole said the investigating team tried to track the locations of Ms. Naik and Mr. Karale’s mobiles, but both their phones were switched off. On Monday morning the phones were turned on and their locations were traced to Neral near Matheran. The team then rushed to the location and arrested the accused on Monday night. Mr. Dhole said, “The couple had been married for 10 years. Ms Naik and Mr. Karale met each other on Facebook a year ago and had been in a relationship for the last six months. Inquiries with some of the couple’s relatives indicate that Gopal had found out about the affair and that it had led to frequent fights between them.” The police said Ms. Naik had mixed sleeping pills in Mr. Naik’s food. When he fell asleep, she called Mr. Karale in the early hours of December 29. The duo tried to strangle him in his sleep, but he woke up. In the ensuing scuffle, Gopal bit Mr. Karale on his wrist. The duo then allegedly hit him on the head with an iron rod. They then took him to the hospital after making sure he was dead, the officers said. The duo has been charged with murder under the Indian Penal Code and have been remanded in police custody till January 7.|0|
Man sets daughter ablaze; held|Palghar|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|A teenage girl from Palghar is battling for her life in Mumbai’s JJ Hospital after she was allegedly set on fire by her 40-year-old father at their house, the police said on Tuesday. The 16-year-old victim suffered 70% burn injuries, a police official said. Mohamad Mansuri, was apparently angry with his daughter for being continuously hooked to her mobile phone. After an argument with her, he poured kerosene on her and set her ablaze. Other members of the family were away at the time. The girl was rushed to hospital by her neighbours, he said. Mr. Mansuri has been arrested and booked for murder under Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code.|0|
Parrikar’s visit to secretariat surprises many|Panaji|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|On the first day of the new year, Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar made a surprise visit to the State secretariat at Porvorim on Tuesday, where he was welcomed by ministers, party MLAs, and BJP workers. Mr. Parrikar (63) with a nasogastrict tube running from the nasal passage into the stomach was accompanied by a team of medical professionals and staff from the Chief Minister’s Office. This is his first visit to the secretariat since his return from All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi on October 14, last year. This is also his second public appearance in the last few months. Last month, the CM visited the under-construction third bridge on the Mandovi river. Sadanand Shet Tanavade, general secretary of BJP, Goa, who was present, said the visit will boost the enthusiasm of the BJP cadre and the people of Goa. “This is a good development. Seeing our CM is encouraging for our cadre,” Mr. Tanavade told press persons. He later said Mr. Parrikar held a meeting with his Cabinet colleagues and officials to review work. Mr. Parrikar was diagnosed with advanced pancreatic cancer in February last year. He is under treatment at his private residence after treatment in hospitals in Mumbai, U.S. and Delhi. The Opposition has been demanding that he resign or hand over the charge of office to some Cabinet minister till he recovers, insisting that his operating from his private residence has led to the collapse of the administration. Meanwhile, Dr. Shekhar Salkar, chief of oncology department, Manipal-Goa Hospital, lauded the CM. “In Mr. Parrikar, we see a strong man with tremendous willpower to win against the deadly disease. In the fight against cancer, there can be only one winner; it’s either the patient or cancer. He has set a good example for all cancer patients that they have to be positive in their approach,” Dr. Salkar, who is an office-bearer of the Goa Cancer Society, said.|0|
Baby pulled alive in Russia from ruins of apartment block|Moscow|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Russian rescuers on Tuesday pulled a baby boy alive from the ruins of an apartment block that collapsed in a gas explosion more than a day earlier, killing at least seven people and leaving dozens missing. “The rescuers heard crying. The baby was saved by being in a cradle and warmly wrapped up,” Chelyabinsk regional Governor Boris Dubrovsky wrote on his Telegram channel. The Emergencies Ministry said the child is a 10-month-old boy. Mother also survives The mother of the boy, named as Vanya, also survived the blast, RIA Novosti news agency reported, citing the emergency services. The child is in an extremely grave condition with serious frostbite of his limbs, a head injury and multiple leg fractures and he will be evacuated for treatment in Moscow, a Health Ministry statement said. Part of the 10-storey apartment building collapsed following a gas explosion on Monday morning in the industrial city of Magnitogorsk, nearly 1,700 km east of Moscow in the Ural mountains. The baby was found after rescuers were forced to temporarily halt the search for dozens of missing people in the rubble for fear that the rest of the block could come down. The child survived temperatures that fell overnight to around -27°C, TASS reported. The incident has claimed at least seven lives and only six survivors have been found. The Soviet-era appartment block was home to around 1,100 people. The blast completely destroyed 35 flats while 10 more were damaged.|0|
This is too big a victory, say Awami League supporters|Dhaka|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Eta ektu barabari hoye gesse[this is a bit too much] — this is how Awami League supporters reacted a day after the party swept 97% of seats in the national Parliament in Sunday’s general election. Perhaps the Opposition should “have been given” 50-60 seats to make the election look credible, said some of them, declining to be named. The Awami League and its allies won 288 of the 299 seats contested, securing a third consecutive term in power. Jatiya Oikya Front, the Opposition coalition led by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), got nine seats. The Awami League chief, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, blamed the Opposition for its debacle. She said the election was free and fair and that the Opposition failed to put up a strong fight against the ruling party. She also said the people rejected them for their violent politics. One-sided victory “At least 20-30 seats, if not 60-70, would have been better for democracy, this is too one-sided. God knows what lies ahead,” said Smruti S. Pattanaik, a research fellow at the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, a New Delhi-based autonomous think tank funded by the Government of India. An Opposition-less Parliament may not be conducive for democracy, said Ms. Pattanaik, a Bangladesh expert. “Look at the Pakistan results. Even if it is managed by the Army, there is an Opposition in Parliament and Prime Minister Imran Khan will have to address the checks and the balances in the system,” she said. There is concern within the Awami League camp regarding the nature of the results. From ordinary activists to high-profile professors who publicly support their favourite party, people privately acknowledged that they are “embarrassed” to talk to their friends within the BNP. A senior journalist, who is an Awami League supporter, said the victory “could be the beginning of a complete one-party rule in Bangladesh”, which may not be “very exciting”. Professor Imtiaz Ahmed of the International Relations department in Dhaka University said that the Awami League’s activists “may have panicked” after the early polling. “The massive turnout in the first three or four hours probably have panicked them. Bangladesh has about 60-65% block votes, divided between two political alliances. The rest 30-35% matters as it may go in any way... now the large turnout may have panicked the Awami Leaguers and candidates went for an overkill,” said Mr. Ahmed. He feels the party “this time” was committed to a fair election. “But even without the overkill, they would have won it in any way ” said Mr. Ahmed. ’Worked hard’ Saidul Islam, a staff of the elite Dhaka Club in the capital city, feels the same. “After all, the Awami League government worked hard this time,” said Mr. Islam, a BNP supporter. His mother, Manowara Begum, paralysed waist down, told him so, he claimed. “She said that the Awami League got electricity in their area in Lokkhipur district and invested in roads, which has pleased her,” said Mr. Islam. He echoed Mr. Ahmed’s claim that the Awami League would have won the contest any way. On Monday, in the presence of 11 international journalists and a host of foreign observers, Prime Minister Hasina explained the same — why the party would have won in any case.|0|
Cong. claims victory in panchayat polls|Chandigarh|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Tuesday hailed the victory of Congress-backed candidates in the recently concluded panchayat polls in the State as a triumph of democracy and a clear vindication of his government’s policies. He also congratulated the people of Punjab for ensuring a largely peaceful poll, in which 80.38% of the total 12,787,395 eligible voters exercised their franchise.  Security forces hailed Of the 13,276 booths in which polling was held, re-poll has been ordered in 14, Mr. Singh said in a statement here, lauding the security forces for maintaining law and order during the elections “despite attempts by the Opposition to trigger trouble”. “Undeterred by the false propaganda unleashed by the Opposition parties, including the Shiromani Akali Dal, against the Congress government, the voters came out in large numbers without fear to cast their votes in favour of my party’s candidates,” he said. “This shows that the disillusionment of the electorate with the SAD and other parties, including the BJP and AAP, is complete,” the Chief Minister said, adding the people of Punjab were no longer willing to be misled by “canards” being spread by these parties. “The victory of Congress-backed candidates is a triumph of democracy and a vindication of my government’s policies,” he said.|0|
Sanaa, Jan 1, 2019 (AFP) -|Sana’a|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|  Yemen's Houthi rebels on Tuesday rejected UN accusations of selling aid meant for civilians, slamming the World Food Programme (WFP) for sending “rotten food”. The WFP on Monday accused the Houthis of “criminal behaviour” and of selling food aid in markets in Sana’a.AFP|0|
Now, bid for Air India business class seats with Upgrade Lite|Mumbai|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|To bring in cash and also fill up seats, Air India has introduced Upgrade Lite, a service through which passengers can bid for First and Business Class seats. Successful bidders will be notified at the check-in counters while those not successful will get a refund. Air India has partnered with Optiontown, a travel option website, to jointly allow an upgrade to First or Business class. Under Upgrade Lite, the airline is claiming to offer seats for up to 75 % less. Giving an example of how it will work, an airline official said, if one has booked through Air India to fly any domestic or international destination from Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Bengaluru and Chennai, he or she can sign up for a chance to upgrade to Business or First Class using Upgrade Lite. The passsenger will be informed between four to one hour (depending on type of upgrade) of departure. If an upgrade does not come through, the amount will be refunded within five days of the flight’s departure. Reserve price “The bidding range will have a pre-defined reserve price. The bidding time for a specific flight will be open till 0-4 hours for both domestic and international flights. Bidders need to have a valid ticket,” the official said. Bidding on airline upgrades is basically like a blind auction for unsold seats on a flight. Over 50 major airlines offer such a platform to let passengers bid on unused space in their business and first class cabins rather than fly with empty seats up front. Among the airlines that offer such an option are Air Canada, Air New Zealand, Cathay Pacific, Hawaiian Airlines, Lufthansa, Qantas, Singapore Airlines, Swiss, Virgin Atlantic and Virgin Australia. Air India officials said that bids are accepted per person and per flight, and not on a total itinerary. “So you will have to bid on each individual flight separately if you have more than one connection, and you must bid on each individual passenger’s reservation. This is important since upgrades are non-transferable,” Reji Philip, a Fort-based travel agent said.|0|
U.S., Israel officially quit UNESCO|Paris|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The U.S. and Israel officially quit the UN’s educational, scientific and cultural agency (UNESCO) at the stroke of midnight, the culmination of a process triggered more than a year ago amid concerns that the organisation fosters anti-Israel bias. The withdrawal is mainly procedural, yet serves a new blow to UNESCO, co-founded by the U.S. after the Second World War to foster peace. The Donald Trump administration filed its notice to withdraw in October 2017 and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu followed suit. The withdrawals will not greatly impact UNESCO financially, since it has been dealing with a funding slash ever since 2011 when both Israel and the United States stopped paying dues after Palestine was voted in as a member state of the organisation.|0|
Yogi govt. to set up shelters for stray cattle|Lucknow|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Uttar Pradesh Cabinet on Tuesday empowered the urban and rural civic bodies to run temporary shelters to take care of stray cattle. A policy decision to this effect was taken in a Cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, a government spokesperson said. He said with the machines having taken over the traditional methods of agriculture, the cattle owners often abandon their livestock, leading to problems like damage to crops, traffic disruptions and road accidents. The new policy will enable departments concerned to work in coordination with each other and achieve better results, he said. The State’s Animal Husbandry Department too will help the civic bodies in their endeavour, he said, adding the government will strive to make these “gauvansh ashray asthal” self-sustaining. Earlier last week, the Chief Minister had directed officials to make immediate arrangements for proper care of stray cows.|0|
Parliamentary committee irked by States’ insensitivity to Western Ghats|Mumbai|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Over 56,000 square kilometres of ecologically sensitive areas (ESA) in the Western Ghats could not be earmarked as ‘no-go’ zones due to State governments’ ‘insensitivity’, a parliamentary committee has said. The panel has urged the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change to constitute a committee to address the issues and grievances of local people. The recent monsoon floods in Kerala and parts of Karnataka should serve as alarm bells for the administrations in the States of Goa, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, which have failed to mark ESA in the Western Ghats, the Committee on Government Assurances in the Rajya Sabha has said. The panel, which keeps track of assurances given by ministers on the floor of the Upper House, presented its latest report on Monday. The panel had examined issues regarding the categorisation of the Western Ghats as ESA as per the recommendations of two committees led by Madhav Gadgil and K. Kasturirangan. The report said, “The committee has observed that despite three draft notifications issued over four years for earmarking ESA, the six States could not be brought on board for action. Resultantly, over 56,000 square km of ESA could not be earmarked as ‘no-go’ zones for polluting activities and deforestation, and large-scale deforestation, mining, and construction are continuing unabated, hurting the ecology of the Western Ghats.” “Insensitivity towards ecology of the Western Ghats is making the six States vulnerable to floods and landslides,” the report said. “The committee is of the view that implementation of the recommendations of the Kasturirangan report is only possible with active support of local population. It also requires consultation with the State government at micro level to achieve the objectives of saving the Western Ghats,” the report said. The panel examined 62 assurances during its deliberations with various State governments and other organisations, and had visited Pune, Mumbai, Chennai and Bengaluru, before preparing its report.|0|
Ahmednagar effect: NCP will join hands with BJP if Sena withdraws, says Kadam|Mumbai|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Shiv Sena leader and Environment Minister Ramdas Kadam on Tuesday said he had talks with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress to win the mayoral election in the Ahmednagar Municipal Corporation, but was ditched at the last moment by the NCP. Mr. Kadam said since the NCP supported the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Ahmednagar, even before the Assembly polls, the Sena has a legitimate fear that the NCP will take its place in case they decide to withdraw from the government. The alliance between the BJP and the NCP at Ahmednagar seems to be the centre stage of political discourse. “This municipal corporation election has once again proven that the NCP stands with the BJP. The NCP has given its support to the BJP before the Assembly elections in Maharashtra, and therefore we fear that in case we withdraw from the government, the NCP will fill in for us,” Mr. Kadam said. The NCP said the Sena should better concentrate on running the government with its ally, the BJP, instead of criticising the NCP. “We are capable of setting our house in order. But the Sena should better focus on making its marriage with the BJP a success,” NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said. The minister claimed that in a bid to keep the BJP out of power, he had spoken to NCP leader Ajit Pawar and Congress leader Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil about joining hands for the Ahmednagar mayoral election. “We were trying to put the entire opposition together. But, they chose to go with the BJP,” he said. Mr. Kadam’s clarification comes a day after Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis claimed that the BJP wanted to ally with the Sena and was waiting for the request. “We waited till the last minute but the Sena did not make any request to us. And we did not ask for the NCP’s support; they gave it on their own. Therefore questions should be asked to the NCP and not us,” he had said. NCP president Sharad Pawar on the other hand has said that action against all 18 party corporators will be taken as despite clear instructions to not tie up with the BJP, they violated the order.|0|
Signs of a turnaround|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The fog of bad loans shrouding the banking sector appears to be lifting after a long period of sustained stress. The Reserve Bank of India’s Financial Stability Report reveals the first half-yearly decline in the ratio of gross non-performing assets (GNPA) to advances since September 2015. The ratio across all scheduled commercial banks has eased to 10.8% as of end-September 2018, from 11.5% in March, with both public sector and private sector lenders posting drops in the key indicator of bad loans. A stress test for credit risk at banks that models varying levels of macro-economic performance shows that for the baseline assumption, the GNPA ratio would narrow to 10.3% by March 2019. This prompted RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das to prognosticate that the sector “appears to be on course to recovery”. Still, state-owned banks continue to have higher levels of bad loans than their private sector peers and are projected to show slower improvements over the second half of the fiscal. The GNPA ratio for public sector banks (PSBs) is posited to only inch lower to 14.6% by March, from 14.8% in September. One reason is that PSBs have a disproportionately higher share of bad loans from among large borrowers, who accounted for almost 55% of loans advanced by all banks as of September. The GNPA ratio for this category at PSBs was 21.6%, compared with just 7% at private banks. Interestingly, the RBI’s Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework, which attracted criticism including from a government appointee on the central bank’s board, has significantly helped lower contagion risk to the banking system. A contagion analysis that assumes there would be no sovereign guarantee provided for the 11 PSBs placed under the PCA curbs, in the event of a simultaneous failure, projects that solvency losses due to such failure have more than halved over the four quarters ended September: to Rs. 34,200 crore (3.1% of total Tier-1 capital) from Rs. 73,500 crore (6.8% of total Tier-1 capital). Data on banking frauds are also a cause for concern. Close to 95% of the frauds reported in the six months ended September were credit-related, with PSBs again bearing the brunt ofmala fideintent on the part of borrowers. The RBI’s report has justifiably spotlighted the urgent need to tighten the oversight framework for financial conglomerates in the wake of the IL&FS meltdown, which continues to ripple across the financial system, including at mutual funds and non-banking financial companies. As Mr. Das said in his foreword, “...the recent developments in NBFCs have underscored the need for greater prudence in risk-taking.” Regulators and policymakers need to work together to insulate the economy from the risks of similar fiascos.|0|
Egypt could end term limits for Sisi|Cairo|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Supporters of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi are calling for constitutional changes that would allow him to stay in power once his second term ends in 2022. Backers of the former military chief want Parliament to discuss repealing an article limiting Presidents to two consecutive four-year terms. In an editorial published on Sunday, the pro-government state-run daily newspaperAl-Akhbarvoiced hope that 2019 would see “the start of a belated political reform” to secure Mr. Sisi’s future in power. The column by the newspaper’s director Yasser Rizk said this would “preserve all the people’s gains in terms of security, stability and economic recovery” since Mr. Sisi came to power five years ago. He said the change could be approved by late summer 2019.|0|
Debt burden went up by Rs. 1.7 lakh crore during Raje regime: Gehlot|Jaipur|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Tuesday accused the previous Vasundhara Raje government of increasing the debt burden on the State and asked how it increased by over Rs. 1.7 lakh crore in just five years. The debt burden on the State was Rs. 1.29 lakh crore when the BJP came to power in 2013, but it increased to Rs. 3 lakh crore in by 2018, he said. “Our former [Congress] government had left a debt of Rs. 1.29 lakh crore [in 2013]. It was a debt of the last 30-40 years, but it increased to Rs. 3 lakh crore in the last five years. The debt increased by close to Rs. 1.75 lakh crore. How did this happen,” asked Mr. Gehlot. The Chief Minister was responding to a question on the financial challenges before his government after it announced farm loan waiver, which will add a burden of Rs. 18,000 crore on the State exchequer. Mr. Gehlot also demanded that the NDA government at the Centre waive farm loans across the country like the Congress had done after coming to power recently in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.  Farmers’ rally He also said a big rally of farmers will be organised in the State soon to put pressure on the Narendra Modi government to waive loans. He alleged that the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre had waived bad loans worth Rs. 3.5 lakh crore of select industrialists when loans of farmers should have been the priority. “The former UPA government [at the Centre] had waived farmers’ loans worth Rs. 72,000 crore and the Congress [governments] in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh has also announced to waive loans,” Mr. Gehlot told reporters here.|0|
A Democratic hope?|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Elizabeth Warren, Democratic Senator of Massachusetts, has announced her likely candidacy for the 2020 U.S. presidential race. In her statement she put racial and gender-based inequality front and centre in her campaign agenda, as much as income inequality faced by the middle class. For these ills of the American economy, she blamed the excesses of under-regulated Wall Street corporations and billionaires with the money muscle to bend political rules. Although Ms. Warren, who won a second six-year Senate term in November, had declined to enter the 2016 general election and challenge Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary, she made a name for herself as a top-tier Democrat by taking on President Donald Trump, describing him as a “thin-skinned racist bully”. However, she attracted criticism for an unnecessary controversy over taking a DNA test to establish her Native American heritage, after Mr. Trump used racist epithets to provoke and smear her ethnic antecedents. Notwithstanding that blip, the former Harvard law professor, who hails from a blue-collar background in Oklahoma, has repeatedly underscored her credentials as a champion of multiracial populism. Over the past year she has sharpened her attack on Mr. Trump’s politics, arguing that he deflects attention from the impact of his divisive policies on ordinary American families and instead blames “other working people, people who are black, or brown, people born somewhere else.” Despite the considerable achievements of Ms. Warren, who had not held public office before 2013, the obstacles ahead for her proposed presidential run are formidable. First, the general expectation is that the field for the Democratic nomination will widen considerably over through 2019, given that more than three dozen Democratic candidates-in-the-making are said to be considering joining the race, several of them for the first time. Some, such as Kamala Harris of California or Cory Booker of New Jersey, could hold stronger appeal with millennial voters and people of colour. Second, it is hard to predict how Ms. Warren will fare against self-professed Democratic socialist candidate Bernie Sanders, or Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, both economic populists who could hypothetically cut into her share of voters of a similar ideological persuasion. Finally, the risk of pursuing a populist theme from the centre-left of the political spectrum is that she would be an easy target for Mr. Trump and conservatives, who are likely to deride her as an out-of-touch liberal academic and a threat to free enterprise. Nevertheless, as a candidate for the nation’s highest office, Ms. Warren’s ideological moorings are set. It is not inconceivable that, given how bitterly polarised the electorate is today, Ms. Warren’s bold liberalism could offer hope to millions of voters dismayed at what Mr. Trump has done to their nation.|0|
Israel rejects UN Council censure motion|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Israel last night [January 1] virtually rejected the Security Council’s unanimous resolution censuring it for last Saturday’s [December 28] attack on Beirut airport. It described the resolution as a reflection of the ‘moral, political and juridical bankruptcy of the world body’. The Israeli delegate’s response was also seen as an indication that Israel would defy the recommendation that reparations be paid to Lebanon for the damage done to planes and installations at Beirut airport. The Security Council earlier condemned Israel for its pre-mediated action in violation of its obligation under the Charter and the cease-fire resolution and considered that such acts of violence endangered the maintenance of peace. Issuing a ‘solemn warning’ to Israel that if such acts were repeated the Council would have to consider further steps to give effect to its decisions, the Council also considered that Lebanon was entitled to appropriate redress for the destruction suffered, the responsibility for which has been acknowledged by Israel.|0|
Strange bedfellows in West Asia|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Increasing intimacy between Saudi Arabia, the so-called bastion of Islamic orthodoxy, and Israel, the Jewish state carved out by the colonial powers in Arab Palestine, appears astonishing at first sight. The growing relationship, even if surreptitious, between the two states can be explained in large part with reference to the old adage, “my enemy’s enemy is my friend”. Complex reasons The enemy is Iran, which both countries perceive as the primary threat to their strategic interests in West Asia. Saudi Arabia is engaged in a fierce competition with Iran for influence in the Persian Gulf and wider West Asia. Riyadh seems to be losing this competition as demonstrated by recent events in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq as well as tiny Qatar’s defiant attitude. The reasons for Israel’s overtures towards Saudi Arabia are more complex. A common front against Iran is, of course, a major factor determining Israeli policy. Iran is a potential challenger to Israel’s nuclear monopoly in West Asia and uses its influence in the Levant to impede Israeli dominance of the region. But equally important, the Israeli government believes that improved relations with Riyadh will serve other major goals. First, Saudi Arabia’s lead in establishing relations with Israel, even if covert, is likely to induce other Arab states, especially the oil rich monarchies of the Gulf, to open their economies to Israeli investment and technical expertise, thus bringing Israel substantial economic benefits. Israel’s success in achieving this objective is critically dependent upon developing a significant, even if unacknowledged, relationship with Saudi Arabia. Second, the Israeli government estimates that improved relations with the Saudi regime, the “guardian” of Islam’s two holiest sites, will help resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to Tel Aviv’s satisfaction. This means Israel continuing to control the entire territory between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea without giving the Palestinians any civil or political rights. Israel feels that with Saudi help, the status quo could be made acceptable to other Arab and Muslim countries as well since several of them, such as Egypt and Pakistan, are heavily dependent upon Saudi largesse. Furthermore, Israel and Saudi Arabia have a common interest in preventing the democratisation of Arab countries. Authoritarian governments in the Arab world allow Israel to parade itself as the only democracy in West Asia. Saudi Arabia is mortally afraid of a democratic wave in the Arab world since it would further highlight the despotic nature of its regime. This apprehension drove its opposition to the democracy movements, especially in Egypt and Bahrain, during the short-lived Arab Spring. U.S. nod The Saudi-Israeli rapprochement has been actively supported by the Trump administration. The United States is extremely interested in the formation of a joint front between Saudi Arabia and Israel against Iran, America’s principal adversary in West Asia. Jared Kushner, the U.S. President’s son-in-law and the administration’s point man on West Asia, has developed a special relationship with Saudi Crown Prince Muhammad Bin Salman (MBS) in order to achieve this and other ends. He had used his leverage with MBS to prod the latter to accept Israel’s point of view on the Palestine issue before the Jamal Khashoggi murder stalled the expansion of the Saudi-Israeli relationship. The rapprochement between Riyadh and Tel Aviv was moving apace until October 2, 2018, when Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident journalist, was murdered at the behest of the Saudi regime in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. Senior officials of the two governments, including Mossad head Yossi Cohen, had clandestinely met several times. On the Saudi side, former senior aide to the Crown Prince, Saud al-Qahtani, and former deputy intelligence chief, Major General Ahmed al-Assiri, had played important roles in the secret negotiations with Israel. Khashoggi murder However, the Khashoggi murder has thrown a spanner in the works for several reasons. First, the two principal Saudi interlocutors have been dismissed from their crucial positions in order to demonstrate to the international community that the Saudi regime is genuinely interested in bringing Khashoggi’s murderers to justice. Second, MBS, who many believe ordered the killing, has been the focus of intense criticism, including by leading Senators and Congressmen in the U.S., following the brutal murder and dismemberment of Khashoggi’s body. He is also held responsible for the Yemeni misadventure, which has left thousands of civilians dead and millions on the verge of starvation. He cannot, therefore, afford to take greater political risks at this moment by continuing the parleys with Israel. This does not mean that the Saudi-Israeli relationship will return to the level of hostility that had once existed between the two states. Rapprochement has been an ongoing process for close to two decades. It was dramatically expedited with the appointment of MBS as Crown Prince and the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia. One can, therefore, conclude that their common hostility towards Iran and their close security relationship with the U.S. will eventually prompt Saudi Arabia and Israel to resume their covert relationship and eventually make it public. However, their contacts are likely to remain frozen for some time until the Khashoggi murder recedes from public memory. Yet the Saudi-Israeli rapprochement could be accelerated if MBS, who has been the driving force behind the Saudi policy of engagement with Israel, ascends to the Saudi throne in the near future.

Probe initiated after Manchester attack|Manchester|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|A British police probe into a triple stabbing at a Manchester railway station on New Year’s Eve which injured three people, is now being treated as “a terrorist investigation” the city’s top officer said on Tuesday. Counterterrorism officials have arrested a man who remains in police custody, and are searching an address where he recently lived in the northwestern English city, Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said. The suspect reportedly shouted “Allah” during what Mr. Hopkins called a “horrific attack” on three people, including a police officer, at Manchester Victoria station on Monday evening. ‘Serious injuries’ A man and a woman, both in their 50s, are still being treated in hospital after sustaining “serious” injuries, while the officer was also stabbed in the shoulder, he added. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, which happened around 8.50 p.m. (2050 GMT) when many revellers in the city would have been enjoying New Year’s Eve celebrations.|0|
The bilateral transformation|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The spectacular victory of the Grand Alliance led by the Awami League (AL), headed by incumbent Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in Bangladesh’s 11th general election, has delighted her supporters. This election is also a milestone for the coming of age of a new generation which is avowedly aspirational and is tired of the old political discourse that had deeply divided politics in Bangladesh. They have voted for economic progress and a secular polity. The margin of victory has shocked and dismayed the Opposition parties that had coalesced into the National Unity Front (NUF), a coalition at whose core is the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the AL’s bitter political rival. Former AL stalwart and famous jurist Kamal Hossain provided the leadership glue for the Opposition coalition. Nominally led by its Chairperson, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, currently in jail for corruption, the BNP’s guiding force is U.K.-based acting-Chairman Tarique Rahman, her controversial son who fled from the country in 2008 and lives in exile. He is convicted of money laundering and conspiracy to murder. Brute majority The AL has obtained a brute majority of 288 seats in a unicameral Parliament which has 300 directly-elected seats and 50 seats reserved for women. The latter are elected by the electoral college of directly-elected MPs, with proportional representation to parties elected to the Parliament. Mr. Hossain’s monumental failure to deliver has left him and other Opposition leaders hurling allegations that the elections were “farcical” and asking that new elections be held under a non-partisan caretaker administration. The NUF managed to win just seven seats. The Election Commission, while taking note of some electoral malpractices and promising investigation, has declared the results valid and rejected the demand for new elections. The margin of victory has lent some traction to persistent allegations of electoral malpractices, hounding of the Opposition, large-scale arrests of Opposition workers and intimidation of voters. Election-related violence on polling day claimed 17 lives. Several Opposition candidates withdrew from the fray, citing violent obstruction by AL workers, kidnapping of their election agents and voters being obstructed from casting their votes. Yet international observers have concluded that the elections were largely peaceful, fair and credible. Though dogged by two consecutive controversial elections and increasing perceptions of authoritarian behaviour, Ms. Hasina is set for another five-year term in office. She has an enviable record of delivering record economic growth. Bangladesh’s GDP grew at a rate of 7.6% in the last quarter, making it one of the fastest growing economies in the world. A bipartisan consensus During the last decade of Ms. Hasina’s tenure as Prime Minister, high-level Bangladesh-India engagement has intensified. There is an irrevocable and irreversible bipartisan political consensus in India for upgrading relations across a comprehensive interface of ties. India’s ‘neighbourhood policy’ has focussed on Bangladesh, which has emerged as a key interlocutor in India’s ‘Act East Policy’ and sub-regional groupings like BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) and the BBIN (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal) Initiative. In Bangladesh too, a growing domestic political consensus, overriding fractious politics, has emerged in favour of close ties with India. Denial of support to Indian insurgent groups, with insurgent leaders handed over to India, has progressively built trust and confidence between the two countries. Bangladesh is India’s largest trading partner in South Asia with an annual turnover of around $9 billion plus an estimated informal trade of around $8-9 billion, across the 4,100-km-long porous border. Cooperation in connectivity, energy, security and intelligence matters has intensified. The Padma multipurpose bridge and the Akhaura-Agartala rail link will dramatically change connectivity within Bangladesh and with India. Waterways are also being revived to reduce the cost of trade. Improvement in bilateral ties has led to newer areas of cooperation such as cyberspace. Bangladesh has provided cyber connectivity between the international gateway at Cox’s Bazar to Agartala for faster Internet connectivity in India’s northeastern States. India has also become a partner in Bangladesh’s nuclear power programme, with the beginning of construction at the Rooppur nuclear power plant. India is poised to export around 1100 MW of power to meet the energy deficit in Bangladesh. Power projects totalling more than 3600 MW are under implementation by Indian companies. The adverse balance of trade has been a bilateral issue. The asymmetry in the economies of India and Bangladesh is the major factor. To enable more Bangladeshi exports to flow into India, duty free entry was granted in 2011 under the South Asian Free Trade Area. This has led to an increase in exports from Bangladesh from around $350 million to the current level of around $900 million. Bangladeshi exports have plateaued because of demand constraints in India and also because of limited items in the Bangladeshi export basket. An SEZ in Bangladesh for Indian manufacturing companies has been mooted and notified. When operational it will encourage Indian companies to manufacture there and export to India. Indian investment in Bangladesh has reached $3 billion. In 2017, 13 agreements worth around $10 billion were signed in the power and energy sectors. To offset the economic asymmetry, India has granted Bangladesh generous lines of credit (LOCs) and grants, with commitments reaching $8 billion. While LOCs mainly cover infrastructure and connectivity projects, grants flow into social sector development. Capacity building under the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation programme is an important strand in bilateral ties and people-to-people interaction. Bangladeshis are among the largest groups of tourists into India. The visa regime has been liberalised and over a million visas are issued to Bangladeshi citizens annually. With the rise of religious radicalism and terrorism, defence and security issues will require greater cooperation. Bangladesh has taken strong and effective steps against those who have been inspired by the Islamic State and involved in terrorist strikes. Islamist organisations have been breeding grounds for religious radicals and extremist views. These forces will pose a considerable challenge for governance in Bangladesh in the future. With the massive loss, the NUF is likely to boycott the Parliament and take to street agitation, sullying Bangladesh’s reputation as a democracy. Challenges ahead There will be setbacks in India-Bangladesh ties, like the current Rohingya issue, which has imposed a huge economic and security burden on Bangladesh. Bilaterally, the issue of the illegal migration has already acquired a high profile in India with the publication of the draft National Register of Citizens in Assam. This will require deft handling of bilateral ties. Sharing of river waters will remain a challenge, but not an insurmountable one. China’s security and economic footprint has grown in South Asia and managing this will remain a challenge for both countries. While Bangladesh is overwhelmingly dependent on military hardware from China, India has provided a $500 million LOC for procurement of defence-related goods from India. This momentum must be maintained and intensified. India has welcomed the election results and Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the first leader to telephone and congratulate Ms. Hasina. Bangladesh-India relations have reached a stage of maturity and with further upgrading and integration of infrastructure, bilateral ties can be expected to grow stronger in the future.

Taliban confirms meeting Iran officials|Kabul|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Taliban discussed Afghanistan’s “post-occupation situation” with Iran in their latest meeting, the group said on Tuesday, as Tehran makes a more concerted and open push for peace ahead of a possible U.S. drawdown. The remarks come after Iran confirmed on Monday that the Taliban had visited Tehran for a second round of talks in just a few days. The Taliban delegation discussed with Iran “the post-occupation situation, restoration of peace and security in Afghanistan and the region”, the militants said in a statement posted on social media and emailed to journalists. Likely U.S. pullout It signals a growing confidence among the Taliban for U.S. troops to pull out of Afghanistan, after U.S. officials last month told various media outlets that President Donald Trump had decided to slash the number of boots on the ground. There have been reports in the past of talks between Iran and the Taliban, but they have typically been denied by Tehran. Tehran’s peace push will be viewed with concern by hawks in Washington, who fear that Mr. Trump’s planned withdrawal of troops from Syria and Afghanistan will cede regional influence to Iran. The Taliban also met with the U.S., Pakistan and Saudi Arabia in the UAE earlier in December. But, the militants refused to meet a delegation from Afghanistan. The group said on Saturday that its representatives would not meet “with those of the Kabul administration” at the next meeting expected to be held in Saudi Arabia later this month. Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi will travel to Afghanistan in the next two weeks, the Foreign Ministry said. Meanwhile, Taliban fighters killed more than 20 Afghan security forces in simultaneous raids on a provincial capital and district in northern Afghanistan, an official said on Tuesday, as the city braced for further violence. Hundreds of militants were outside Sar-e-Pul city, which provincial Governor’s spokesman Zabihullah Amani said was at risk of falling to the Taliban if reinforcements were not sent.|0|
Boost to plain packaging|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|This year, Thailand and Saudi Arabia will join a growing club of nations introducing plain packaging of tobacco products. They are the first in the Asian and Arab regions, respectively, to adopt the tough measure in order to curb tobacco consumption — from September in Thailand, and May 1 in Saudi Arabia’s case In December 2012, Australia became the first country to introduce plain packaging following the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) guidelines. It has also been implemented in France and the United Kingdom (both 2016), Norway and Ireland (both 2017) and New Zealand and Hungary (both 2018). It will be implemented in Uruguay (2019) and Slovenia (2020). The move is under process or being considered in 14 more countries. Plain packaging standardises the appearance of tobacco products. Other than brand and product names displayed in a standard colour and font style, it prohibits the use of logos, colours, brand images or promotional information. Besides increasing the effectiveness of health warnings, the idea is to reduce the attractiveness of tobacco products, with no scope for using packaging to advertise and promote consumption. Understandably, the tobacco industry was opposed to Australia’s plain packaging initiative. But the ruling by the World Trade Organisation (WTO), in June 2018, favouring plain packaging, has struck a blow against the tobacco industry. The WTO panel, while rejecting the notion that Australia had unjustifiably infringed tobacco trademarks and violated intellectual property rights, said the plain packaging law led to “improving public health by reducing use of and exposure to tobacco products”. With the legal hurdle to tobacco control being cleared, one is optimistic that countries, including India, which were undecided, can take steps to introduce similar legislation. In India, tobacco is the cause of about one million deaths annually. In April 2016, India increased the size of graphic pictorial warnings, by 85%, on the packaging of tobacco products (both front and back). The percentage of users in India who thought of quitting because of such warning labels increased sharply to 62% (cigarette), 54% (bidi) and 46% (smokeless tobacco users), according to the Global Adult Tobacco Survey 2016-2017, when compared with the survey results of 2009-2010. Likewise, tobacco use among those aged 15-24 years showed a six-percentage point reduction (18.4% in 2009-10 to 12.4% in 2016-17). The number of tobacco users dropped by eight million. Along with higher taxes and large pictorial warnings, plain packaging can serve as a tool to deter new users and prompt existing users to quit. Here is the proof: plain packaging along with other measures led to 0.55 percentage point reduction in smoking prevalence in Australia, translating into at least 1,18,000 fewer smokers.

U.S., China vow to boost ‘cooperation’|Beijing|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Presidents of China and the U.S. have exchanged messages vowing to boost cooperation despite a bruising trade war, on the 40th anniversary of the countries’ diplomatic relations, state media reported. In the messages sent on Tuesday, President Xi Jinping underlined the importance of working with the U.S. “to advance China-U.S. relations featuring coordination, cooperation and stability”, Xinhua reported. According to Xinhua, President Donald Trump praised the last four decades of diplomacy between China and the U.S., hailing his “solid friendship” with Mr. Xi. Washington and Beijing imposed tit-for-tat tariffs on more than $300 billion worth of goods in total two-way trade last year. However, since the two leaders agreed on a truce on the sidelines of the G20 summit meeting in Buenos Aires, there have been small signs of progress. The two nations established diplomatic relations on January 1, 1979, with the U.S. pledging to have only non-official ties with Taiwan.|0|

GST collections down for second month in a row|NEW DELHI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The government’s collections from the Goods and Services Tax (GST) declined for the second month in a row to Rs. 94,726 crore in December, official data released on Tuesday showed. Collections declined from the Rs. 97,637 crore in November, which was itself lower than the Rs. 1,00,710 crore collected in October. “The total gross GST revenue collected in the month of December 2018 is Rs. 94,726 crore of which CGST is Rs. 16,442 crore, SGST is Rs. 22,459 crore, IGST is Rs. 47,936 crore… and cess is Rs. 7,888 crore,” the government said in a statement. “The total number of GSTR 3B Returns filed for the month of November up to December 31, 2018 is 72.44 lakh.” ‘A bit discouraging’ “The slight dip in GST revenue collections as compared to the last two months is a bit discouraging,” Abhishek Jain, tax partner at EY, said. “This may deter the government from rationalising the rate of goods left in the 28% category like cement, auto parts, etc, in the short term,” Mr. Jain added. The GST Council had in its 31st meeting in December cut rates on 17 items and six types of services, leaving just one common use item — cement — in the 28% tax bracket. The new rates took effect from January 1, 2019. “While the December collections are lesser than October (where it exceeded Rs. 1 lakh crore) and November, overall average collection for 2018-19 has shown marked improvement over 2017-18,” Pratik Jain, partner and leader, indirect tax, PwC India, said. “This, coupled with decent growth in income tax collections, gives a clear indication that the tax base is expanding.” Mr. Jain said the next couple of months may also see similar collections, which means that the central government might want to come up with a “more realistic” estimate of GST collections for next year.|0|
Park Fair Fire. Loss of Life and Property.|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Madras Park Fair, opened much against popular wishes and in the teeth of united opposition of the City Fathers and a section of the Press, came to an unhappy termination last night (January 1). Fireworks were widely advertised all through the City. People assembled in large numbers at 8 P.M. His Excellency the Governor was also present to witness the tamasha. At about 11 O’clock when the display of fireworks was about to close, one of the pots burst, scattering thick sparks all round. The fire engine shed was the first to catch. The petrol kept there for the use of the engine also caught fire. As the fire engine could not be easily brought out, the task of extinguishing the fire was rendered difficult. A few buckets of water could not suffice. Fire engines were telephoned for. But before their arrival the fire spread from stall to stall to the south. Nine booths including the engine-shed were ablaze, the metal-ware stall, the Amrutanjan Depot, the Temperance booth, the confectioner’s shop, the Trash Bazaar, the lottery booth and the fruit and flower bazaars.|0|
Auto sales remain muted in December|NEW DELHI / Mumbai|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Maruti Suzuki sold more than 1.19 lakh passenger vehicles (PVs) in the domestic market in December 2018, an increase of 1% from the over 1.18 lakh units sold in the year-ago month. The company said while the sales of mini segment cars (Alto and Wagon R) declined by 14% to 27,661 units, those of compact segment cars (Swift, Celerio, Ignis, Baleno and Dzire) fell 3.8% to 51,334 units. However, the sales of mid size Ciaz grew 89.7% to 4,734 units. Additionally, sales of utility vehicles rose almost 5% to 20,225 units. Sales of vans, Omni and Eeco, rose 39% to 15,850 units. Maruti Suzuki also said its exports declined 36.4% to 6,859 units. Honda Cars India posted a 4% growth in sales last month to 13,139 units in the domestic market. The company exported a total of 315 units during the month. Rajesh Goel, senior vice-president and director, sales and marketing, Honda Cars India Ltd. said, “The market continued to remain challenging in December.” Year-end offers However, with lucrative year-end offers on many of our models and strong performance of new models Amaze and CR-V, the company recorded 4% sales growth in December 2018.” Rival Hyundai Motor India posted 4.8% increase in domestic sales to 42,093 units in December 2018. The company’s national sales head Vikas Jain said the company achieved its best-ever domestic sales of 5,50,002 units in 2018 on the back of all new Santro, Grand i10, Elite i20, Verna and Creta. Stating that December was a challenging month for the industry with muted consumer sentiment, Tata Motors said its PV sales in the domestic market recorded a growth of 0.6%, to 14,260 units despite these challenges. Sluggish period Mayank Pareek, president, PV business unit, Tata Motors Ltd., said, “In December 2018, we have strived to maintain our growth trajectory during what was a rather sluggish period for the entire auto industry.” On the other hand, Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) said sales of PVs in the domestic market declined 3% to 15,091 units. Rajan Wadhera, president, automotive sector, M&M Ltd., said, “…in the domestic market, challenges relating to tight liquidity and low buying sentiment continue the de-growth for December.” M&M’s farm equipment sector reported a 6% decline in tractor sales to 17,404 units compared with 18,488 units sold in the same month of the previous year due to a sudden drop in exports and below-than-expected rabi crop sowing during the month. In the two-wheeler segment, Royal Enfield posted a decline of 14% in domestic sales to 56,026 units.|0|
Small growers may get tea estates’ support|Kolkata|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Recognising the rising importance of small tea growers (STG) in the supply chain, tea estates in North India are testing a project called ‘Trinitea,’ which aims at providing support to the STG at the farm and market level. A MoU was signed between the Indian Tea Association (ITA) the apex body of North Indian tea producers and Solidaridad for jointly implementing this project, which aims at providing support to STGs in the form of customised farm management as well as access to real time information on climate, soil and markets, a senior ITA official said. Solidaridad is a network which works to promote sustainable production of 13 commodities across nine regions globally. Supplementing output The project is already being rolled out in select ITA-member tea gardens who supplement their output through the STG crop. This comes close on the heels of the three MoUs signed between ITA and STG Associations in West Bengal and Assam. A long-term partnership between the formal traditional sector and the informal STG sector is necessary, Azam Monem, ITA’s outgoing chairman, had said, adding “this (the MoUs) would create better value and acceptability in the global and domestic market for teas produced across the value-chain encompassing both the sectors” he said. The STG sector’s share in total Indian tea crop has been rising steadily and now constitutes 47% of the total production. Many large producers are sourcing green leaf from STG and in the absence of testing facilities, outsourced green leaf from multiple agents fail to comply with the permitted standards of pesticides and good farm practices. “Although it is early to comment on the Trinitea initiative, we are welcoming this move,” Bijoy Chakraborty, president, Confederation of Indian Small Tea Growers Association, toldThe Hindu. The project would help monitor green leaf quality, establish traceability mechanisms and set up vendor development for supply of farm inputs.|0|
‘Six firms went live at Sri City’|CHENNAI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|As many as six companies went on stream and seven others commenced civil works in Sri City in 2018, according to a top official. “We call it eventful, as it witnessed an array of important events and developments such as ground-breaking ceremonies, plant inaugurations, visits of foreign diplomats, dignitaries, tours of business delegations, meetings and seminars,” said Ravindra Sannareddy, founder-managing director, Sri City. Expanding capacity During 2018, more than 20 new customers entered into memoranda of understanding with the Andhra Pradesh government to invest about Rs. 3,826 crore. Of these, seven firms commenced civil works, six went on stream and a few others ramped up production capacity, he said. Sri City, which is a ‘smart, integrated business city’, is located about 70 km from Chennai. It has been attracting significant fresh investments. Hero MotoCorp has committed to invest Rs. 1,600 crore while Alstom is planning to double the number of production lines. In the last 10 years, Sri City has attracted investments worth more than Rs. 28,000 crore. Currently, it houses over 180 companies from 27 countries such as Pepsi, Kellogg’s, Isuzu, Mondelez, Alstom, Kobelco and Foxconn, among others. Besides, it houses a Technical Skill Development Institute, Krea University and postal financial services. Separately, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry has nominated Mr. Sannareddy as a member of the committee constituted for reviewing the Special Economic Zone policy in the country.|0|
‘Banks unfairly charged for soiled notes’|Mumbai|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Committee on Government Assurances has questioned the rationale behind banks being asked to bear the cost of soiled and counterfeit notes, particularly during the demonetisation exercise of 2016. In its report tabled in the Rajya Sabha on Monday, the committee said it did not understand the rationale behind the policy wherein the banks had been asked to bear the losses arising out from mutilated and counterfeit notes, when they had no role in mutilating or circulating counterfeit notes, particularly just after demonetisation when they had the onerous task of handling huge cash flow. Doubling in number The number of soiled notes more than doubled in 2017-18 compared to the previous financial year. According to RBI data, 27,678 million pieces of soiled notes were disposed of by banks in 2017-18 compared to 12,503 million pieces in 2016-17. Over 99% of the notes that were rendered invalid by demonetisation had returned from circulation. However, the number of counterfeit notes detected in 2017-18 was lower at 5,22,738 pieces as against 7,62,072 in the previous year. The committee also felt that it was improper to penalise the banks especially at a time when they had stretched their limits to support the government during demonetisation process and has recommended that the Department of Economic Affairs should consider relaxing note refund rules in this regard. A Navaneethakrishnan, Chairman, Committee on Government Assurances, presented the 72nd Report of the Committee to the Rajya Sabha. The panel discussed the issue with some public sector banks and representatives of the RBI, NABARD and Department of Economic Affairs and Ministry of Finance on its study visits to Kolkata, Chennai and Bengaluru. The committee deals with the culling of assurances, examination of implementation of assurances, and dropping of assurances given by Ministers while replying to questions raised by Members during the proceedings of the Rajya Sabha.|0|
‘Tyre industry may invest Rs. 20,000 cr.’|MUMBAI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Tyre companies in India are likely to invest Rs. 20,000 crore in the next five years in capacity addition to meet the growing demand, according to credit rating agency ICRA. “The tyre industry in India has witnessed large capacity additions in the last decade with a cumulative spend of Rs. 27,800 crore; of which 70% was spent in the last six years. “With tyre demand remaining favourable, supply addition in the industry is expected to remain high going forward,” ICRA said in a report. It said based on the announcements, tyre industry was likely to see a capacity addition of Rs. 20,000 crore over the next five years. Stating that the outlook for the Indian tyre industry would remain stable, ICRA said tyre demand would grow by 7-9% over the next five years supported by favourable outlook for the domestic automotive industry. “In FY2019, the domestic tyre industry benefited from strong growth in both original equipment (OE) and replacement segments. Robust sales While there have been some headwinds such as the floods in Kerala, tightened financing, insurance-related regulatory changes impacting two-wheeler demand, rising fuel and interest costs, the year-to-date sales growth across most segments have been robust leading to healthy OE tyre demand growth,” ICRA said. It said the replacement tyre demand, too, had recovered sharply in the last one year supported by post-effect of Goods and Service tax (GST), pick-up in infrastructure activities and a healthy, consumption-driven demand. “Specifically, there was a strong demand rebound in truck and bus segment (where replacement share is high at 70%),” it said. ICRA said tyre exports from India have been steadily increasing in the last one year with recovery in demand from overseas markets and rising competitiveness of Indian makers, both in terms of quality and pricing. Imports dwindle On the other hand, tyre imports had dwindled in the last one year following the re-imposition of anti-dumping duty (ADD) on import of new Chinese truck and bus radial (TBR) tyres for a period of five years effective from September 18, 2017 and increase in customs duty by 500 bps to 15%, effective April 1, 2018. “This has supported the domestic TBR (truck and bus radial) players as the large capacities added in recent years are now being effectively utilised,” the rating agency said.|0|
Reserve Bank relaxes debt recast norms for MSMEs|Mumbai|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Following a demand from the government for a debt recast package for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has relaxed the provisioning norms for lenders for restructuring loans of up to Rs. 25 crore. According to the guidelines released on Tuesday, the RBI has allowed one-time restructuring of existing loans to MSMEs that are in default but ‘standard’ as on January 1, 2019. Banks have to make only 5% provisioning for restructuring the loans as compared to 15-20% earlier. The government has been asking for such a package for a long time for the MSME sector which was severely hit due to demonetisation exercise and implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). Enabling environment “Considering the importance of MSMEs in the Indian economy, it is considered necessary at this juncture to take certain measures for creating an enabling environment for the sector,” RBI said. The issue of restructuring of MSME accounts was discussed by the RBI board on November 19, 2018 . The issue also figured during RBI’s recent interactions with the lenders. “The above issue has been examined in RBI and a view has been taken to facilitate meaningful restructuring of MSME accounts that have become stressed,” RBI said. The restructuring has to be implemented by March 31, 2020, the RBI said. “A provision of 5%, in addition to the provisions already held, shall be made in respect of accounts restructured under this scheme,” the RBI said, adding that each bank or non-bank should formulate a policy for this scheme with the board’s approval.|0|

4 PSB stocks surge after govt. infuses Rs. 10,882 cr.|New Delhi|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Bank stocks were in demand on Tuesday after the government infused Rs. 10,882 crore in four public sector lenders. Shares of UCO Bank soared 12.1% to close at Rs. 22.70 apiece on the BSE. Bank of Maharashtra gained 3.83%, as did Central Bank of India (1.36%) and Syndicate Bank (1.27 %). The government on Monday infused Rs. 10,882 crore in four public sector banks, including UCO Bank and Syndicate Bank, as part of the Rs. 28,615-crore capital infusion to be done in about half a dozen public sector lenders. UCO Bank received Rs. 3,074 crore in equity by way of preferential allotment on Monday, the bank said in a regulatory filing. Besides, Bank of Maharashtra got Rs. 4,498 crore, Syndicate Bank (Rs. 1,632 crore) and Central Bank of India (Rs. 1,678 crore). Buying was also seen in other bank stocks, with Bank of Baroda surging 3.74%. So did United Bank of India (3.61%), Bank Of India(2.21%), Punjab National Bank (2.11%) and State Bank of India (1.25%). Analysts attributed the rise in banking stocks to Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das’s statement that the sector is on “course to recovery” as the afflicting non-performing assets recede.|0|
Aviation fuel prices slashed by 14.7%|NEW DELHI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Aviation turbine fuel (ATF) prices have been cut for the second month in a row by a record 14.7% for the month of January 2019, according to a notification issued by Indian Oil Corporation and other State-owned oil marketing companies. Jet fuel will now cost Rs. 58,060.97 per kilolitre in Delhi, the benchmark market for the country, effective January 1. This represents a Rs. 9,990 per kilolitre price cut from the Rs. 68,050.97 per kilolitre in December 2018. Jet fuel prices had been revised on a monthly basis since March 2018. This is the second consecutive reduction in rates and the biggest single cut ever, the data showed. In December, prices were cut by Rs. 8,327.83 per kilolitre, or 10.9%. With the two successive cuts, jet fuel rates are now lower than petrol and diesel prices on a per litre basis. While ATF now costs Rs. 58.06 per litre, petrol costs Rs. 68.65 per litre and diesel Rs. 62.66 per litre in Delhi. The two consecutive price reductions have brought ATF rates to their lowest levels in a year and will provide much-needed relief to cash-strapped airlines. (With PTI inputs)|0|
Cheteshwar Pujara — the man for all reasons and seasons|Sydney|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|He has steel in his bones. Does not get flustered by situations or the opposition. And scores with substance over style. Cheteshwar Pujara’s composure and solidity have been massive factors in India retaining the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Virat Kohli and his men now eye a historic series triumph in the fourth Test at the SCG. The skipper will be seeking another influential performance from Pujara. His two hundreds in the series so far — 123 in Adelaide and 106 at the MCG — have been match-winning efforts. Pujara has blunted and subdued a very good Aussie attack. Change in mindset The patient Pujara has even managed to alter Kohli’s mindset in the ongoing series. How things change! In the 2014-15 series, Kohli, who had taken over captaincy after M.S. Dhoni announced a shock retirement from Tests in Melbourne, did not include Pujara in the final Test at the SCG. The reasoning was that Pujara, unable to force the pace at No. 3, was slowing down the Indian innings. Kohli was keen on momentum, on keeping the scoreboard ticking along briskly. After the Melbourne Test last Sunday, Kohli said, “Now we have the bowling attack that we can rely on to get us 20 wickets and his [Pujara’s] role becomes even more crucial.” Kohli added, “If he can bat time and hold one end, and all the other batsmen can bat positively around him, we get 350, touching 400, in conditions in Australia, which puts us in a great position to get a result.” To his credit, Pujara has worked on his batting. Last time around down under, he was troubled by the extra bounce since he was crouching too much in his stance. When the ball climbed, he was unable to get on top of the ball and keep it down. Now, Pujara is more upright and relaxed in his stance, in a much better position to play the lifting deliveries. He is also able to essay the back-footed strokes through point or covers, so crucial on the Australian pitches. Intelligent batting This has been a series where Pujara has batted intelligently, showing judgement around off, defending the good deliveries, rotating the strike and waiting for the bowler to err in length. When the ball was over-pitched, he has driven the sphere firmly off the front foot between cover, mid-off or down the ground. Anything on his legs, he can whip. And Pujara has picked runs off the pull shot. Pujara employs his feet against spinners, but has also used pad-play tactfully against the world class off-spinner Nathan Lyon in this series. The 30-year-old Pujara has 328 runs at 54.66 from the three Tests of the series so far. And in 67 Tests overall, he has 5233 runs at 49.73. Earlier in the year, Pujara’s unbeaten 132 in Southampton was an innings of character in testing conditions. He rallied with the tail, even pulled out some big shots towards the end. Kohli said Pujara had become more “flexible” in his approach. That’s true again. Indians ponder over XI Meanwhile, the Indians had an off-day at Sydney on Tuesday. The team-management has to make a big call ahead of a Test that could become a part of India’s cricketing folklore. The surface at the SCG has traditionally assisted the spinners from day four and the Indians could well strengthen their attack with the inclusion of a second spinner in R. Ashwin in the eleven. Ashwin is making good recovery from an abdominal muscle strain and has been bowling a lot in the nets. If fit, Ashwin could come in for Rohit Sharma who has flown back to India for personal reasons. Ashwin, along with physio Patrick Farhat and strength and conditioning coach Shankar Basu, came to the SCG on Tuesday and bowled. This was not an official fitness test but Ashwin was the lone Indian cricketer at the ground. The fact that both spinners, Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja, who bowled capably in Melbourne, can bat will ensure that the batting is not weakened. Gunning for glory at the SCG, India will need all its bowling resources.|0|

‘We need a long-term strategy to address agricultural distress’|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Days after finalising the seat-sharing arrangement in Bihar for the 2019 general election with allies Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Janata Dal (United), Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution and Lok Janshakti Party president Ram Vilas Paswan takes stock of the electoral prospects of the National Democratic Alliance and of the proposed Opposition front to take on the NDA, and talks about his impending retirement. Excerpts: You reached an understanding for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls with the BJP and the JD(U) after a tussle, forcing your party to deliver an ultimatum. What was the sticking point? Each party wants to fight on more seats but that does not mean that we had any differences with the BJP or the JD(U). The word “ultimatum” was used by the media to refer to our talks, but we have always maintained that it is an internal matter of the alliance. It has been effectively settled and well ahead of the elections. We will fight the 2019 elections under the leadership of Narendra Modi. I had said it in 2013 and let me repeat it again, there is no vacancy at the top. There’s an assumption that the number of seats the BJP has conceded in Bihar is because of its waning popularity. That is not true. We never believe or indulge in bargaining. All we asked for was seven seats [of the 40 Lok Sabha seats in Bihar], the same number we contested in 2014. What created confusion were media reports of a four-plus-one formula [four Lok Sabha seats and one Rajya Sabha seat for the LJP]. These reports were not contradicted by the BJP. This was creating unrest among our cadres, which is why my son Chirag said the issue needed to be settled at the earliest. Many say that Bihar and Uttar Pradesh hold the key to the 2019 polls. So doesn’t the Bahujan Samaj Party-Samajwadi Party in U.P. and the Congress-Rashtriya Janata Dal alliance in Bihar worry you? The BSP-SP alliance will have no impact on the NDA’s electoral prospects. I can give you in writing that Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav together will get only five seats. My declaration is based on my analysis of the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, when I lost the Hajipur constituency for only the second time in my career. [The LJP had snapped ties with the Congress just before the elections to join hands with Lalu Prasad’s RJD.] What was the reason for this loss? The Muslim vote. The Congress is always the first choice for a Muslim voter. They vote for anyone else only if Congress is not in the race. now as reports indicate the Congress is unlikely to be part of the Mahagathbandhan, then the decisive vote of the Muslim minority will be divided. The SP-BSP alliance is banking on three vote blocs — Muslims, Yadav and Dalits. Muslim votes will be divided between them and the Congress, Yadavs alone can’t get them through. There are two strands among Dalits too. One is Jatavs who blindly follow Mayawati and the other is Paswan, Pasis and so on, who are with us. Also, both parties will fight on 40 seats each, so what about other 40 wannabe candidates from their respective parties? Were they here for a charity show? They will have to deal with rebellion too. To top it, the Congress will fight all the 80 seats [in U.P.]. Even if the Congress cuts 1 lakh to 50,000 votes in each constituency, then how will the BSP-SP alliance stand? In Bihar, there is no threat to the NDA. The Opposition alliance keeps spreading rumours that they are talking to Ram Vilas Paswan. I have never spoken to Lalu Yadav. Three diseased people together can’t make a healthy individual. There are already murmurs within Manjhi’s party (Jitan Ram Manjhi’s Hindustani Awam Morcha); Upendra Kushwaha (Rashtriya Lok Samata Party) is waiting with bated breath for power; Sharad Yadav exited the JD(U) with much fanfare, now we don’t hear much from him, do we? We will win more than 35 seats in Bihar. The Congress seems to be cashing in on the Modi government’s failure to address growing agricultural distress by offering loan waivers. Will this have an electoral impact? If a person is in pain, a painkiller can give him temporary relief, but the germs do not die. For the short term, loan waivers work well. But we need a long-term strategy. In Madhya Pradesh, for example, there is no doubt that Shivraj Singh Chouhan came up with pro-poor policies. He started the practice of bonus per quintal of produce. There was a view that businessmen benefitted more from this policy because they were bringing in produce from other States to sell in Madhya Pradesh. I was against the move and eventually the Central government decided to stop the bonus. It is obvious that the farmer was disappointed. Who do you blame for this disappointment? It is not a question of blaming anyone. Decisions are made by experts, IAS officers, intellectuals, they have their way of doing the arithmetic. A politician who comes from a village or a farmer’s home will have a different outlook. When we calculate the minimum support price (MSP), we consider the input costs alone and never take into account the cost of the land. The Prime Minister, BJP president Amit Shah, and the Agriculture Minister have to deliberate on the crisis. The politicians think through their heart and the bureaucracy works through its head. It is a systemic failure, and we should think how to change this system. Do you think tall promises like 2 crore jobs each year made by Mr. Modi and Mr. Shah will be their undoing? Why blame Prime Minister Modi or Amit Shah, this Pandora’s box was opened in 1991. Who was the Finance Minister then? Manmohan Singh. Before liberalisation, there was a mixed economy. There were enough jobs in the government sector. You opened the floodgates, and now that the waters have entered, how will you stop that? For 24 years, you did not bother which way the country was going. Now in 2014, when the Modi government took over, you are asking, where are the jobs? There were more government jobs earlier and thus more security, now everything is privatised. But Manmohan Singh did not promise 2 crore jobs. No, every government makes promises. Didn’t Indira Gandhi say “garibi hatao”? Did Congress implement it? If anyone is to be blamed, it is the Congress government which is to be blamed the most. From being seen as anti-farmer, the Modi government is also battling the perception of being anti-Dalit. This is a wrong claim. The biggest example is the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, which was passed during the Rajiv Gandhi government and that too after relentless protests by many of us in Parliament. Thirty years later someone went to the Supreme Court and got the law diluted. Even then no political leader really took a lead to protest against it, neither me nor Mayawati. A purely organic and voluntary wave of protests started on its own spurred by social media. And one must remember that for the first time 10 to 12 Dalit protestors were killed in such a protest, more than the casualties during the Mandal agitations. So obviously, there was pressure on all political parties to act. We also took a tough stand, Chirag served an ultimatum to the BJP. The Modi government acting swiftly, amended the Act to maintain the status quo. Now the people who called the Modi government anti-Dalit started accusing him of being anti-forward. In Madhya Pradesh, they [BJP] paid for it. It is easy to assign labels, but my question is, which government has done anything for Dalits and backwards? As an astute observer of Indian politics, which election in the past will you compare the 2019 election to, 1977 or 1996?  Whatever may be the results in 2019, one must remember that people have learnt lessons from the past. The question is, what kind of government do you want? Do you want a three-month government? The Deve Gowda and I.K. Gujral governments were in power for less than a year each; V.P. Singh was Prime Minister for 11 months; and Chandra Shekhar was in power for seven months. Wherever there is a direct fight between the BJP and the Congress, the Congress manages to win. The recent Assembly elections in three States are examples, there may have been factors such as anti-incumbency which worked against the BJP. Though vote share between the two was almost same, still the Congress managed to pull through. The prime difference is that in 1977 all the parties had come together to fight under one umbrella and the symbol of the Janata Party. That situation does not exist today. Now each party wants to fight on its own. Look at Mayawati. She had demanded a high number of seats in Madhya Pradesh from the Congress and then went on to fight on her own. Then she joined hands with the Congress even without being asked. The Telangana Chief Minister and Telangana Rashtra Samithi chief, K. Chandrashekar Rao has been talking of a non-BJP, non-Congress Federal Front. Would you ever consider joining that? I will be where I have been. If you ask me to play an astrologer, then I would say that the NDA will form the government. Once the elections are over, who will consider Rao as a leader? Will Mamata Banerjee or Chandrababu Naidu work under him? You can form any front right now, but once the question of leadership arises, then everyone will run away. Janata Party, that was born from the very womb of the Emergency, could not sustain itself in the face of personal ambitions and egos. Do you think any other front will survive? Will you contest the 2019 Lok Sabha polls? No, I will not fight the 2019 polls. I have been contesting from Hajipur since 1977 and I have done a lot for the constituency. I had always thought that once I complete 50 years in politics I will take a step back. Now I have a son who is also in politics. If I continue to stand around him, overshadowing him like a banyan tree, how will he grow? I have seen other leaders who can’t help but compete with their sons too. I am not like that. Look at Lalu Yadav, he is remote-controlling his party from behind bars. I do not believe in that. There has been a demand from the constituency that my wife should contest from the seat but she too has refused the offer. We will have to take a call on who will replace me in Hajipur.  You can form any front right now, but once the question of leadership arises, everyone will run away|0|

Adventurous Bhati bolsters Delhi|KOLKATA|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Delhi found an unlikely hero in No. 9 batsman Subodh Bhati, whose maiden half-century, a breezy 53-ball 62, facilitated his team to set Bengal a stiff target in the Ranji Trophy Group B match at the Eden Gardens here on Tuesday. Resuming on 41 for two, Delhi benefited from Bhati and Himmat Singh’s useful knocks to post 301 in its second innings and set the host a target of 322 for a victory. Bengal was 18 for no loss at close on the penultimate day. When Delhi lost its ninth wicket at 221, thanks to another big-hearted five-wicket haul by Bengal trump card Ashoke Dinda, the match looked evenly-poised in the final session. However, Bhati (62 off 53, 5x4, 6x6) and Kulwant Khejroliya (21 off 18, 3x4, 1x6) swung their arms fearlessly to whip the Bengal bowlers at will and switch the momentum in Delhi's favour in 10 overs. Earlier, overnight batsmen Kunal Chandela and Nitish Rana added 24 runs before being separated. Himmat Singh (51 off 92, 7x4) and Jonty Sidhu (42 off 90, 5x4, 1x6) batted sensibly to gather 85 runs for the fifth wicket. Himmat cut and drove, while Sidhu played with a straight bat to gather most of their runs. Poor shot Himmat fell to a poor shot outside the off-stump. Sidhu stepped out and was stumped before tea. Mukesh had Shivank Vashisth caught in the slips with the new ball to end the latter’s 32-run stand with Shivam Sharma (27). Dinda, who hit the right line and length to pick up the wickets of Hiten Dalal and Anuj Rawat overnight and Rana in the morning, shouldered the maximum workload. He had Shivam lbw and Akash Sudan caught behind to complete his 26th five-for and return match figures of nine for 150. Bhati, known for his batting exploits in club cricket and his 57-ball 200 in Goan league, upset the host’s plans by plundering runs at will off bouncers. Bhati not only entertained the holiday crowd by hammering six sixes between long-on and long-off but also protected Khejroliya to stretch Delhi’s lead before being run out. The scores:  Delhi — 1st innings: 240. Bengal — 1st innings: 220. Delhi — 2nd innings: Kunal Chandela c Tiwary b Pramanik 25, Hiten Dalal lbw b Dinda 11, Anuj Rawat c Tiwary b Dinda 10, Nitish Rana lbw b Dinda 17, Himmat Singh c Pan b Mukesh 51, Jonty Sidhu st Pan b Pramanik 42, Shivam Sharma lbw b Dinda 27, Shivank Vashisth c Majumder b Mukesh 9, Subodh Bhati run out 62, Akash Sudan c Pan b Dinda 8, Kulwant Khejroliya (not out) 21; Extras (b-1, lb-12, nb-2, w-3): 18; Total (in 96.4 overs): 301.

Karnataka takes a healthy overall lead|Bengaluru|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Chhattisgarh did well to stall a Karnataka offensive on the third day of their Ranji Trophy encounter, but the host managed to make significant inroads. Harpreet Singh’s valiant century helped Chhattisgarh avoid the follow-on, before Pankaj Rao’s incisive spell put Karnataka in a spot of bother. A brisk unbroken 63-run fifth-wicket partnership between Manish Pandey (57 batting, 60b, 7x1, 1x6) and Shreyas Gopal (21 batting, 43b, 1x4), however, gave Karnataka a healthy overall lead of 248 runs. Skipper Harpreet, on 53 overnight, held firm to record his ninth first-class hundred. Harpreet, who was part of the Indian team for the 2010 ICC Under-19 World Cup, batted for six hours for his 239-ball 120. The compact southpaw was taken out by a moment of brilliance from K. Gowtham, who flew to his left and snatched a blinder at square-leg. Karnataka pacer Ronit More finished with five for 48 — his third five-for of the tournament. More settled into a fluent rhythm and generated good pace on a pitch which offered little help. More is now tied with J. Suchith as Karnataka’s highest wicket-taker of the Ranji season (23). Fellow fast bowler A. Mithun (four for 64) had a good day at the office as well. Chhattisgarh was dismissed for 283, and conceded a 135-run lead. Blistering spell Karnataka was rocked by a blistering opening spell from Pankaj, who rattled the stumps of D. Nischal, Liyan Khan and K.V. Siddharth in quick succession. Working with the breeze, Pankaj got the ball to move in from a full length. All three batsmen were bowled through bat and pad, attempting drives. When opener Devdutt Padikkal was sent back by spinner Ajay Mandal, Karnataka was left at a precarious 50 for four. Pandey and Shreyas ensured that Chhattisgarh made no further inroads. The 29-year-old Pankaj, who has taken 10 wickets for the match, said: “It is a dream to get 10 wickets against a strong team like Karnataka. I was very keen to do well in this match, because it will catch the attention of the national selectors.” Pankaj made his List A debut way back in 2009, for Madhya Pradesh. He then found it tough to keep his place in the Madhya Pradesh team, and moved to Chhattisgarh when the State got first-class status in 2016. The long wait to rejoin the domestic cricket circles only increased the hunger in Pankaj to make his mark. “I’ve been among the top wicket-takers, across formats, in the last three years. I’m always fired up when I take the field,” Pankaj said. The scores:  Karnataka — 1st Innings: 418. Chhattisgarh —1st Innings: Avnish Singh b Mithun 16, Anuj Tiwary lbw b Mithun 4, Manoj Singh c Sharath b Mithun 4, Amandeep Khare c Sharath b Mithun 45, Harpreet Singh c Gowtham b More 120, Ashutosh Singh lbw b More 18, Vishal Singh c Vinay b Shreyas 20, Ajay Mandal b More 41, Shivendra Singh (not out) 8, Pankaj Rao b More 0, Onkar Verma c Pandey b More 0, Extras (lb-6, w-1): 7; Total (in 89 overs): 283.

Vidarbha steamrollers Mumbai|NAGPUR|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Mumbai’s miserable season turned from bad to worse as it handed Vidarbha a historic innings and 145-run win over the 41-time champion. The thrashing ensured a quarterfinal spot for the title holder while Mumbai will not feature in the knockouts for the first time in 11 years. The Jamtha pitch had started offering slow turn but it wasn’t demonic at all. Considering that Mumbai started the day at 169 for six in its first essay, it was clear that it would face the ignominy of being asked to follow-on. After the tail added 83, the need of the hour was for Mumbai’s batsmen to apply themselves, make Vidarbha’s spin troika earn wickets and stretch the match into the last day. Instead, Mumbai’s second dig lasted only 208 balls, with its batsmen guilty of some of the worst possible shot selection. Five specialist batsmen — Vikrant Auti, Shreyas Iyer, Shubham Ranjane, Shivam Dube and Aditya Tare — were dismissed trying to play big shots. Auti started the downfall by top-edging a sweep off left-arm spinner Aditya Sarvate to deep square-leg in the third over. In the same over, Jay Bista shouldered arms only to see the ball crashing into the off-stump and leave Mumbai 10 for two. Captain Siddhesh Lad was probably unfortunate to be adjudged leg-before with the ball appearing to slide down the leg. Shreyas holed out in the deep after hitting two sixes to be Sarvate’s fourth victim. Ranjane followed soon after offering catching practice off the bowling of offie Akshay Wakhare. At 65 for five, it was clear that the match would not head into the last day. But Mumbai appeared to be in a hurry as Dube stepped out to be stumped and then Tare — who had survived for over an hour — attempted an audacious heave off Sarvate to only top-edge it to Wasim Jaffer at first slip. The bearded left-arm spinner fittingly finished the match with Tushar Deshpande nicking one to the keeper minutes before Tea. The only batsman to apply himself was Dhrumil Matkar, who was included for his left-arm spin! The southpaw followed up his five-for with a patient unbeaten 62 in the first innings. He was promoted to No. 3 in the second and played percentage innings to emerge as the highest scorer before one from Akshay Karnewar rose on him and took his glove to Jaffer. The scores: Vidarbha — 1st innings: 511.

Bhui, Bharat help Andhra to a huge lead|VIZIANAGARAM|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Ricky Bhui cracked his fourth century (129, 248b, 14 x 4, 2 x 6) of the season and the wicketkeeper-batsman K.S Bharat his first (178 not out, 277b, 22 x 4, 2 x 6) to help Andhra take a commanding 231-run lead against Hyderabad on the third day of the four-day Ranji Trophy Group-B match at Dr. PVG Raju ACA Sports Complex here on Tuesday.  In reply, Hyderabad, left with the only option of saving the game now, was off to a decent start scoring 33 for no loss at close of play. Interestingly, it was the free-stroking, wicket-keeper-batsman Bharat who was the focus of attention with his wide range of strokes — both against pace and spin. The way he pulled debutant pacer Ajay Dev Goud for a six and a four in one over very early in the morning and then leaned into exquisite cover-drives off both left-arm spinner Mehdi Hasan and offie Saaketh Sai Ram was a treat to watch. Not surprisingly, it was he who first reached the century in style pulling pacer Ravi Teja to the fence. Trademark punches Ricky Bhui, too, left his impression with trademark punches on either side of the wicket. His was a more measured and compact approach to the task as the two strung together a 234-run stand for the fourth wicket which effectively shut Hyderabad out of the game. Bhui eventually got out swishing one on the off-stump off pacer Ravi Teja. Mehdi picked a couple of wickets when the batsmen went for the slog to score some quick runs. Overall, it was a disappointing bowling display with Ajay Dev Goud and Saaketh being the least impressive on a pitch which had eased considerably. The scores:  Hyderabad — 1st innings: 271  Andhra — 1st innings: C.R. Gnaneshwar c Ravi Teja b Ajay Dev 65, D.B.

Sindhu outlasts Saina in marathon|PUNE|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Saina Nehwal got the loudest cheers on her first appearance in Season 4 of the Premier Badminton League while P.V. Sindhu earned the maximum points and hammered out a 11-15, 15-9, 15-5 win in women’s singles in the most entertaining contest of the night. The latter was the inspiration in a resounding 5-0 victory for Hyderabad Hunters against North Eastern Warriors. Hunters’ men’s singles specialists Lee Hyun Il and Mark Caljouw produced powerhouse performances to snuff out the Warriors’ resistance. Lee won a Trump Match against Tanongsak Saensomboonsuk; so did Mark against Tian Houwei, putting the tie beyond Warriors’ reach. Sindhu and Saina are considered the trumpcards of Indian badminton from different generations. Though not engaged in a Trump Match, it did not matter to the fans at the Balewadi stadium whose rousing welcome set the stage for an interesting battle between form and experience and current World No. 3 against No. 9. Sharp on court and switching seamlessly between defence and offence, Saina broke into a clenched fist celebration after winning the opening game. Playing true to her reputation, Sindhu regained the stranglehold in the second game, focusing on tiring out Saina. India’s No. 1 shuttler banked on half-smashes and clever use of angles to pile on the pressure and clinch the second game. Though Saina had regained momentum, she had to play catch up in the face of ruthless smashes from across the net as Sindhu cruised home. Hunters led 3-1 at this stage. Lee prevails South Korea’s Lee faced off against Thai Tanongsak in a match between two left-handers, finding their own angles to sent the bird gliding across the net. Both attempted to deceive the other using wristy, deceptive shots. The tie went to the decider, serving up a thrill for the fans watching the Korean turning on the aggression when it mattered most. The results:  Hyderabad Hunters bt North Eastern Warriors 5-0 (Kim Sa Rang & Eom Hye Won lost to Kim Ha Na & Lao Min Chun 8-15, 14-15; Lee Hyun Il-(T) bt Tanongsak Saensomboonsuk 10-15, 15-13, 15-9; P V Sindhu bt Saina Nehwal 11-15, 15-9, 15-5; Mark Caljouw bt Tian Houwei-(T) 15-11, 15-14; Bodin Isara & Kim Sa Rang bt Liau Min Chun & Yoo Yeon Song 15-10, 12-15, 15-14).|0|
Seven ITF events for juniors|NEW DELHI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Indian tennis players will have seven ITF junior tournaments at home, starting with the grade-3 event in Chandigarh from January 7.

‘I am hoping to play better than last year’|PUNE|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|At the 2018 Australian Open, when the then 21-year-old Hyeon Chung reached the last four, he became the youngest Grand Slam semifinalist since Marin Cilic in 2010, also at Melbourne. That Chung had beaten both Alexander Zverev and Novak Djokovic en route made the world sit up and take notice. Quietly confident The South Korean couldn’t build on the result, especially in the second half of the season, ravaged as he was by a string of injuries. But as he steps into 2019 at the Tata Open Maharashtra, he was quietly confident. “I had a really good start in Melbourne and I have so many good memories,” he said on Tuesday. “But it has been up and down after that. There were blisters on my feet. I have got special insoles made for my shoes now and it has worked. I had a good pre-season and hoping to play better than last year.” Chung, along with US Open women’s singles champion Naomi Osaka, is part of a rising generation of Asian players who have followed in the footsteps of Li Na and Kei Nishikori. His rise can only add to the popularity of the game in the region Chung felt. “Tennis is not a big sport in South Korea. But after I reached the semis it became more popular,” he said. “So I think it is coming up. There are lot of young Asian players from Korea as well as China. They can be very good.” Ripple effect Chung’s promise and future successes can have a ripple effect on the men’s tour too which has been desperately looking for a breakthrough champion. The likes of Zverev, Russian Karen Kachanov and Greece’s Stefanos Tsitsipas have in the past year fuelled hopes of an imminent change of guard. The 2017 Next Generation ATP Finals winner wanted to be part of that revolution. “I hope I can be [part of the next generation]. They [Djokovic, Roger Federer etc.] are all great players. I am just trying to learn more from them and keep fighting.”|0|
NBFC sector is more fragile than it was a year ago: Kotak|Mumbai|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Kotak Mahindra Bank MD Uday Kotak on Tuesday said even though non-bank lenders have received a breather since the crisis late last year, the sector is more “fragile” than it was a year ago. “We need to carefully watch the space going forward,” he added. Mr. Kotak has been tasked to lead the efforts of saving the debt-ridden infra lender IL&FS. “Hopefully, the NBFC sector which saw significant pressure in October-November last year is beginning to breathe a little better now. “However, I do believe that the sector is more fragile than what it was one year ago,” Mr. Kotak said in an annual message to employees at Kotak Mahindra Bank. He attributed the stress in the NBFC space to liquidity concerns emanating out of the rise in interest rates as the high growth in financial savings post-demonetisation began to go back as currency in circulation. IL&FS, which has a debt of over Rs. 94,000 crore, was the “first major default” and led to questions over whether the nation would have a “Lehman-like mini crisis,” he said. He exuded confidence that the financial sector will weather the current storm with corrective actions such as consolidations in bank balance sheets and steps taken at ensuring stability.|0|
Punjab wins inside three days|MOHALI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Three days ago, they were down and nearly out. But, Punjab’s cricketers suddenly found themselves in with a chance. A 10-wicket win, achieved inside three days, over Kerala at the PCA Stadium has helped Punjab climb the ladder in the Ranji Trophy’s Elite Group A and B. It now has 20 points, the same as Kerala, for which Mohammed Azharuddeen scored a brilliant, maiden hundred — albeit in vain. With just the last round of matches remaining, it should be interesting to follow how the battles for a place in the knock-stage shape up next week. The teams that finish among top five — both the groups combined — go through. Punjab played very good cricket, and won a very important toss too, but Kerala’s batsmen need to take some of the blame for the kind of shots they attempted. For Kerala to set a fairly challenging target for Punjab, it needed to survive the morning session, after resuming at 127 for three. For, here wickets do not just fall in that session, they fall in a heap. They did on Tuesday morning, too. Kerala lost five of them before lunch — though that was two less than it gave away on day one. The third day had begun brightly for the visiting side though, with Azharuddeen greeting Siddharth Kaul with two sweetly-struck fours on either side of the wicket. But in the very next, Manpreet Gony clean bowled captain Sachin Baby with a ball that swung sharply in. The first innings’ top-scorer Vishnu Vinod, however, gave some support to Azharuddeen and added 55 for the fifth wicket before he fell lbw to leg-spinner Mayank Markande, who would finish with four for 56. The dismissal, not entirely unexpectedly, opened up the floodgates, as Kerala contrived to lose its last six wickets for 33 runs. Azharudeen, though, seemed unperturbed. The attractive batsman made 112 (168b, 12x4, 2x6) before giving a catch to Anmolpreet Singh at second slip off Baltej Singh. Punjab needed only 128 to win, but suffered a jolt when Jiwanjyot Singh saw his off-stump knocked off by a Sandeep Warrier inswinger – the third ball of the innings – though it proved a no-ball. He and his partner, the hugely promising teenager Shubman Gill (69 not out, 73b, 127min, 11x4), then had a stroll in the park, taking their home an hour before the scheduled close. “The application showed by our batsmen made the difference,” said Punjab’s delighted coach Rajdeed Kalsi. His counterpart Dav Whatmore didn’t disagree. “The first-innings collapses has cost us dearly this season,” he said. The scores: Kerala — 1st innings: 121. Punjab — 2nd innings: 217. Kerala — 2nd innings: P. Rahul c Baltej b Markande 28, Arun Karthik b Gony 0, Mohammed Azharuddeen c Anmolpreet b Baltej 112, Sanju Samson c Jiwanjot b Kaul 3, Sachin Baby b Gony 16, Vishnu Vinod lbw b Markande 36, Jalaj Saxena b Baltej 3, Sijomon Joseph, Basil Thampi c sub (Choudhary) b Markande 0, M.D. Nidheesh b Markande 11, Sandeep Warrier (not out) 0; Extras (lb-6, nb-1) 7; Total (in 73.1 overs): 223.

The transition from romance to pragmatism is complete|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The change has been gathering pace, and now it is clear: India are prepared to win looking “ugly”, by grinding it out. It is the triumph of pragmatism over romance, placing winning above the dictates of looking pretty. Attractive, wristy (often risky) batsmanship and flighted, tantalising spin — the clichés about Indian cricket — have made way for practical run-making and sustained fast bowling. It is a cultural revolution, no less. It was an attitude anathema to Indians through generations of “going down fighting attractively”, of showing flair and flash that contributed little to the result. But the oohs and aahs as a batsman played a beautiful cover drive usually spared him the condemnations when he threw it away in his 20s or 30s. Those were the days when a fighting draw was all that mattered. The Indian team transited from perennial Test match losers to one capable of drawing matches to one expected to win as the No. 1 side in the world. But through it all, one theme dominated: it was important to look good. Flair and flash, flamboyance, even a bit of ostentation was rewarded with greater public acclaim. Class and charm mattered Sunil Gavaskar and Rahul Dravid might have been the bedrock of the batting in their respective eras, but even these masters of defensive batsmanship were stylish, they had what the public called “class”. Class was important. So was charm. A batsman like Dilip Vengsarkar, No. 1 player in the world, gutsy, hard-hitting and with a wonderful record against the great Windies fast bowlers, was never taken to heart by the Indians. He seemed too focused on his job, too intent on the essential task of scoring runs. Years ago, I wrote that if Vengsarkar had been born in England and David Gower in India, they might have been properly recognised for their batsmanship. Vengsarkar was a “professional”, a besetting sin in Indian eyes, while Gower’s class and vulnerability made him unbearably charming. An Indian example was the great Gundappa Viswanath — poetry came with intimations of death. It was the same with bowling. The visual attraction and legends built around the great spinners — Bhagwat Chandrasekhar, Bishan Bedi, Erapalli Prasanna and S. Venkatraghavan — were millstones around the necks of generations that followed. Every succeeding left arm spinner was compared to Bedi and lost out in the comparison. For years Indians never forgave Anil Kumble for lacking the poetic vulnerability of Chandrasekhar, for not being an extravagant turner of the ball. World class did not automatically mean India class! The Melbourne Test — the wonder is not how India won in Adelaide and Melbourne but how they lost in Perth — seems to have completed the transition. A generation more intent on the “what” and less focused on the “how” describes both the players and the majority of their audience back home. Reflection of society Cricket and society reflect each other. Flamboyance as a by-product is acceptable, but as the main event will not be forgiven easily if it doesn’t lead to victory. K.L. Rahul’s struggle is both technical and historical. Here’s an attractive batsman who is out of step with team philosophy. Whether Cheteswara Pujara is a product of the new culture or the one who is driving it, he is certainly its finest exemplar. He made centuries in both the Tests India won, supremely unconcerned about such mundane matters as strike rates and putting bowlers in their place with dismissive, even arrogant batsmanship. His role is clear — that it has taken Indian cricket so long to realise is probably due to the inevitable confusion that transition gives rise to. The matter was not psychologically settled till Pujara emerged as the hero of both the connoisseur as well as the one-dimensional fan who abhors complexity. Pujara has been the unexpected star of the new India — but unexpected only in the eyes of those who haven’t been following the trend away from romanticism. When Virat Kohli first led in Australia four years ago, romance was still king. He led with flair, making two centuries in a Test and throwing everything into a chase that nearly won India the match. “So near and yet so far” — the staple of headlines on the sports pages not so long ago. Kohli became a hero to the generation espousing romance, but a villain to the pragmatists. The captain had learnt his lesson. In Ravi Shastri he has a manager whose cricket is at the other end of the scale from romantic. India should have won more than one Test in South Africa and England. They lacked the clarity of mind they have displayed in Australia. There must have been moments during the washed out pre-lunch session on the final day when all the arguments for not enforcing the follow on might have mocked Kohli. But in the end, it needed only two wickets, and India could not be denied. India need only a draw in Sydney now. Kohli has said he will go for a win. But the shutters will come down quickly this time. It is the new culture.|0|
Harvinder calls for more seamer-friendly tracks|MOHALI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The IPL may have put India’s assembly line of quick bowlers in the limelight, but the 1990s had also produced several fine pacers. Harvinder Singh was one of them. He didn’t quite live up to the promise he had shown; he played only three Tests and 16 ODIs. But, you may still remember him for some fine spells he bowled at Toronto in 1997 in the ODI series against Pakistan, though fellow-seamer Debasis Mohanty’s exploits are recalled more often. Great start Making his debut, Harvinder had taken three for 44. His victims were Shahid Afridi, Salim Malik and Azhar Mahmood. No wonder, his eyes light up when he speaks about that game. “It was a surreal feeling just making the India team that included legends like Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid,” he toldThe Hinduhere on Monday. “Then to open the bowling in my first Test, at Chennai against Australia in 1998, with Javagal Srinath was an even prouder moment. He was my hero.” Harvinder, who is now the Punjab bowling coach, said he regretted that he could not play more for India. “If I had a bowling coach, like everyone has today, maybe I would have achieved a lot more,” he said. “These are great times to be a fast bowler in India.” Great platform He said the IPL was one of the reasons the country was producing more quicks than ever before. “It is a great platform,” he said. “And you also get to work with some of the world’s best players and coaches.” Harvinder, however, feels India needs to have more tracks that encourage seam bowling. “Even Mohali is not what it used to be; it has lost a lot of its pace, though it still is better than most grounds,” he said. “When I played against Kerala here in 1996-97, the wicket was much greener.” He had taken 11 for 107 to power Punjab to a seven-wicket victory in that match.|0|
Australia not getting priorities right|SYDNEY|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The Australians do not seem to be getting their priorities right. In other words, is enough importance being given to Test-match preparation? Or, are commercial interests hurting Australia’s cricket at its very core? Just consider this: Peter Handscomb was dropped from the team for the third Test at the MCG since the team-management felt all-rounder Mitchell Marsh’s seam bowling could take some load off the pacemen. Handscomb, though, has been retained in the squad for the fourth Test in Sydney. And how does he prepare for the Test? By blasting 70 off 35 deliveries for Melbourne Stars against Sydney Sixers in the Big Bash League (BBL)! Not quite the ideal way to focus on a Test, particularly when you are still part of the squad. Actually, Handscomb is not to be blamed. It is the system that has been put in place by Cricket Australia. These are days when Australia’s domestic First Class competition Sheffield Shield clashes with the BBL. And this is not helping the side’s Test preparation. Batting in Tests is a lot about getting your mind tuned in to the demands of the longer format. When batsmen lose concentration and get out to forgettable strokes after settling down, as the Aussies did at the MCG, it shows a lack of mental discipline. Indeed, some of the stroke selection by leading Australian batsmen in the ongoing series has been disappointing. Application, that ability to focus for long periods, has been absent for most part. In the past, Australian batsmen would hold their ground, play out spells and win sessions. At the MCG in the second innings, it took Pat Cummins to show the more accomplished batsmen what pride in the baggy green cap meant. It’s easy to blame the batting capitulations on the absence of Steve Smith and David Warner. But then, the Australians are not playing India in the sub-continent. They are meeting Kohli’s men in familiar conditions, at home. The influence of limited-over cricket has increasingly affected Australia’s batting depth in Tests and Cricket Australia is not helping the side’s cause by allowing the Big Bash (T20) to interrupt the Sheffield Shield, Australia’s domestic four-day tournament. The BCCI does not mix the IPL or Syed Mushtaq Ali (T20) competition with the Ranji Trophy. Truth to tell, if the Aussies are indeed missing Smith and Warner even at home, then the side’s batting resources are very thin indeed.|0|

Pant babysits Paine’s kids!|SYDNEY|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Rishabh Pant might be the “baby” of the Indian cricket team but on New Year’s Day, the wicket-keeper showed that he is good with babies, something that got an instant thumbs up from none other than Australian skipper Tim Paine’s wife. On Tuesday, Paine’s wife Bonnie put up a picture on her Instagram account which had the 21-year-old Pant holding her son during an event at the Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s residence. Bonnie, who herself posed in the picture, captioned it ‘Best Babysitter’ with a smiling Pant by her side. The reference came after Paine and Pant had a go at each other during the Melbourne Test and the stump microphone recorded their enjoyable sledging. While the Indian ’keeper was batting, Paine referred to his omission from the ODI side. “Big MS (Dhoni) is back in the one-day squad too, we might get him (Pant) down to the (Hobart) Hurricanes we need a batter. Fancy that, Pantsy? Extend your little Aussie holiday. Beautiful town Hobart too, I’ll get you a nice apartment on the waterfront. (I’ll) have him over for dinner. Can you babysit? I’ll take the wife to the movies one night and you’ll look after the kids,” the Australian captain was heard saying on the stump mic. On the very next day, Pant was heard speaking to Mayank Agarwal when Paine came to the crease. “We got a special guest today. Have you ever heard of a temporary captain, ever, Mayank?” Pant said. However, the picture of Pant with Paine’s family is an indicator that the series has so far been played in good spirits.|0|
Ramkumar fights to down Granollers|PUNE|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Ramkumar Ramanathan ushered in the new year with a rousing performance to defeat Spain’s Marcel Granollers 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 to enter the second round of the Tata Open Maharashtra at the Balewadi Stadium here on Tuesday. It was perhaps the right tonic the sparse but enthusiastic crowd needed after Saketh Myneni, who had come through the qualifying, pulled out of the day’s first match because of a foot injury. Ramkumar ensured fans would go home happy. “It was a really tough match,” said Ramkumar after the win. “It was the first of the season and Marcel is an experienced player. But I gave everything I had and I am really happy.” The match was off to a capricious start with three breaks of serve in the first three games. It finally settled when Granollers held for 3-1. Ramkumar, who of late, has increasingly favoured a net-rushing game, served as well as he could, but couldn’t back it up with some smart volleying to make it a winning tactic. Granollers took the set 6-4. Change in fortunes The Indian went in for a break, as if to clear his thoughts, and came out for the second set sporting a new T-shirt. With that changed his fortunes too. He did well to stay with Granollers till 4-4, but appeared to self-destruct by serving two double faults to let his opponent reach 30-30 before serving his way out of trouble. Granollers, who is predominantly a baseliner, sought to give Ramkumar new problems to solve by often using the serve-and-volley game himself. But it sounded the death knell not once but twice. Serving at 4-5, 15-15, he approached the net only to see Ramkumar execute a great cross-court pass. Ramkumar attacked a weak second serve to bring about set point before levelling the match with a fine forehand winner. In the decider, with Granollers serving at 1-2, he tried to hurry Ramkumar twice more but failed; first he had no answer to fierce low return, with the attempted shoe-lace volley crashing into the net. He again charged forward on break point, but was passed. By then, Ramkumar seemed to have gotten under Granollers’ skin. After holding to 5-2, the two exchanged glances on the way back to their respective chairs before the Spaniard approached Ramkumar for a word, only to be stopped by the chair umpire. It however did nothing to break the 24-year-old’s concentration as he romped home. In doubles, the top seeds Rohan Bopanna and Divij Sharan were off to a great start, taking down Radu Albot and Malek Jaziri 6-1, 6-2. The results (first round): Singles: Ramkumar Ramanathan bt Marcel Granollers (Esp) 4-6, 6-4, 6-4; Simone Bolelli (Ita) bt Denis Istomin (Uzb) 6-4, 6-4; Ilya Ivashka (Blr) bt Hubert Hurkacz (Pol) 6-7(9), 6-2, 6-3; Ivo Karlovic (Cro) bt Felix Auger-Aliassime 6-4, 7-5; Jiri Vesely (Cze) bt Antoine Hoang (Fra) 4-6, 6-4, 6-4; Benoit Paire (Fra) bt Thiago Monteiro (Bra) 7-6 (5), 6-3. Doubles: Rohan Bopanna & Divij Sharan bt Radu Albot (Mda) & Malek Jaziri (Tun) 6-1, 6-2; Leander Paes & Miguel Angel Rayes-Varela bt David Marrerro (Esp) & Hans Pdlipnil-Castillo (Chi) 6-3, 6-4.|0|
Riya calls the shots|Ballari|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Dominating performance by Delhi’s Riya Tokas in the 54kg category marked the second day of the third women’s National boxing championships here on Tuesday. Riya landed a flurry of punches in the first round against her opponent V. Vinodhini from Tamil Nadu. She continued her attacking approach in the next two rounds to register a unanimous 5-0 victory. Sohini from Chandigarh was in sublime form getting the better of Sai Sree Reddy from Telangana in the 69 kg category. She went on the offensive right from the start and landed some mighty blows, only for the referee to stop the bout in the first round. The closest bout of the day was fought between Babita Bisht of Uttarakhand and Suman Khoda of Rajasthan in the 69kg category. Both the boxers kept the audience engaged as they traded some strong punches right from the start. It was an even contest till the dying seconds and only in the last one minute of the third round the bout turned in Babita’s favour.  Other results (first round): 69kg: Sohini (Cdg) bt Sai Sree Reddy (TS); Babita Bisht (Utk) bt Suman Khoda (Raj).  60kg: Karnataka Bhavya (Kar) Som Maya Subba (Skm). Bantamweight: Riya Chouhan (Pun) Poulomi Sarkar (Ben). 64kg: Sandhya (HP) bt Sonal Rasal; Gagandeep Kaur (Pun) bt Simran Mendon (Mah) 5-0.|0|
We thought Mumbai would put up a fight: Faiz Fazal|NAGPUR|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|So mediocre has Mumbai looked right through the ongoing Ranji Trophy season that a majority of its opponents have wondered how this doesn’t really look like a typical Mumbai team. After Mumbai’s dismal loss on Tuesday, one couldn’t help but ask Vidarbha captain Faiz Fazal if it actually looked liked a Mumbai team. Praise for spinners “Exactly [it doesn’t]. We thought they would put up a fight but being bowled out under 35 overs, we didn’t really expect that. Credit obviously should be given to the way our spinners bowled,” Fazal said. Siddhesh Lad, who has led Mumbai for the last four games, admitted that the side lacked character and played reckless shots. “We lacked character in this game. It was a must-win game for us but we didn’t do what was required to win. “I agree our shot-selection was extremely poor in this game.” While Fazal underlined Wasim Jaffer’s fluent 178 on the opening day as a “game-changer”, Lad credited Vidarbha’s spinners for their discipline. “They bowled with discipline, which is extremely important on such wickets. They hardly gave any loose balls so we had to take our chances,” he said. Lad was disappointed with the overall season — winless so far with two demoralising losses. Learning curve “Disappointing but it’s been a learning curve. We have got a lot to improve on and now all of us will sit down and discuss the areas to improve,” said Lad. “It’s extremely important for us to learn the lessons and improve from here on because if we don’t make it even to the knockouts, Mumbai’s cricketers will find it difficult to be in the national reckoning. It’s a big loss for Mumbai cricket and as a captain, for me, it’s extremely disappointing to not make it to knockouts.”|0|
Saina and Sindhu set to light up Ahmedabad|Ahmedabad|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The cream of Indian badminton, women and men, and some extraordinary achievers from Asia and Europe will be seen in action in the city for five days as the Vodafone Premier Badminton League (PBL) makes its debut in the State of Gujarat. Seven matches featuring all the nine teams will be played at ‘The Arena by SE TransStadia’ from Wednesday. The likes of freshly minted World Tour Finals women’s singles champion. P.V. Sindhu, an incredible achiever Saina Nehwal, gold medal winner at the Olympics, European Championships and World Championships in Spain’s Carolina Marin will represent three different teams in the league. With the teams competing hard in order to firm up semifinal births, the format of the league could throw some interesting results. The league here is also about promoting badminton in these parts. Gujarat is proud of talented tennis player Ankita Raina and a young table tennis star like Manav Thakkar, but it has hardly seen any promise in badminton. According to Mayur Parikh, secretary of the Gujarat Badminton Association (GBA), the badminton buffs would be keen to see players like Sindhu, Saina, Carolina, K. Srikanth among others in action. Good turn out likely “There are about 3000 players at different academies in the State. I hope to see a good turn out on the day Ahmedabad Smash Masters play (Friday and Sunday). About 1000 boys and girls play serious badminton. “We receive as many entries across all age groups for the State Championships. Some don’t come for the State Championship, either because they don’t have the means or have other priorities like education. “I am trying my best; I am at the badminton courts of the Sports Club of Gujarat now,’’ said Parikh. Some seven years ago, Sindhu, as a junior, won an all-India junior tournament at Atul in Valsad, and Saina too played at Surat long back. Cut to the present, the locals are in for some real treat.|0|
Ramkumar fights to down Granollers|PUNE|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|2019 began memorably for Ramkumar Ramanathan, as he turned in a rousing performance to defeat Spain’s Marcel Granollers 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 to enter the second round of the Tata Open Maharashtra at the Balewadi Stadium here on Tuesday. It was perhaps the right tonic the sparse but enthusiastic crowd needed after Saketh Myneni pulled out of the day’s first match against Benoit Paire with a foot injury. Ramkumar ensured fans would go home happy. The beginning of the match was capricious, with three breaks of serve in the first three games. It finally settled when Granollers held for 3-1. Ramkumar, who of late has increasingly favoured a net-rushing game, served as well as he could, but couldn’t back it up with some smart volleying to make it a winning tactic. Granollers had the set 6-4. Change of fortunes The Indian took a break, perhaps to clear his thoughts, and came out for the second set sporting a new T-shirt. With that changed his fortunes too. “I took the break to slow things down,” he said later. “I was broken very early and things were going too fast. So I sort of wanted to slow it down, regroup and tell myself to put in a lot of first serves.” The results were immediate. He won 15 of 18 first serve points and some of them with hitherto weaker aspects of his game, like the backhand cross-court. Granollers, who is predominantly a baseliner, sought to present Ramkumar with newer problems to solve by often charging towards the net himself. But his opponent was up for it. “I learnt that I should have the right mix,” Ramkumar said. “Even from the back of the court I was comfortable. I stayed with him and went for the shots whenever I had the chance and it worked.” With Granollers serving at 4-5, 15-15, Ramkumar executed a great cross-court pass and went on to level at one set apiece. In the decider, the Spaniard, serving at 1-2, tried to hurry Ramkumar again, but failed. Down 15-30, what was required was a first-rate shoe-lace volley and an inch-perfect approach shot, both of which proved beyond him. By then, Ramkumar seemed to have gotten under Granollers’ skin. The hold to 5-2 was followed by a small skirmish between the two which eventually required the chair umpire’s intervention. It, however, did nothing to break the 24-year-old’s concentration as he romped home. In doubles, the top seeds Rohan Bopanna and Divij Sharan were off to the best-possible start, taking down Radu Albot and Malek Jaziri 6-1, 6-2. The results (first round): Singles: Ramkumar Ramanathan bt Marcel Granollers (Esp) 4-6, 6-4, 6-3; Simone Bolelli (Ita) bt Denis Istomin (Uzb) 6-4, 6-4; Ilya Ivashka (Blr) bt Hubert Hurkacz (Pol) 6-7(9), 6-2, 6-3; Ivo Karlovic (Cro) bt Felix Auger-Aliassime 6-4, 7-5; Jiri Vesely (Cze) bt Antoine Hoang (Fra) 4-6, 6-4, 6-4; Benoit Paire (Fra) bt Thiago Monteiro (Bra) 7-6 (5), 6-3; Laslo Djere (Srb) bt Arjun Kadhe 7-5, 7-6(6). Doubles: Rohan Bopanna & Divij Sharan bt Radu Albot (Mda) & Malek Jaziri (Tun) 6-1, 6-2; Leander Paes & Miguel Angel Rayes-Varela (Mex) bt David Marrerro (Esp) & Hans Podlipnik-Castillo (Chi) 6-3, 6-4.|0|
Vardy scores Leicester winner|Liverpool|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Jamie Vardy scored the Premier League’s first goal of 2019 to earn Leicester a 1-0 win at Everton in a low-quality match to begin the new year on Tuesday. In the second match of the day, Arsenal put behind its hammering at the hands of Liverpool with a authoritavie 4-1 dismantling of relegation threatened Fulham. Granit Xhaka, Alexandre Lacazette, Aaron Ramsey and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored for the Gunners. In a goal that summed up the home side’s sloppy display, Everton winger Theo Walcott misdirected a header from a clearance and teammate Michael Keane then mis-controlled the ball to allow Ricardo Pereira to play in Vardy. The former England striker slotted a low finish past goalkeeper Jordan Pickford and celebrated his 58th-minute goal with a somersault. This was Leicester’s third win in four games over the festive period — the other victories over Chelsea and Manchester City were mixed in with a surprise home loss to Cardiff — and the team is now firmly in the top half of the standings. Everton, though, has only one victory in eight games since the start of December and there were constant groans coming from the crowd at Goodison Park throughout a game featuring a slew of basic mistakes from both teams.  The results: Everton 0 lost to Leicester 1 (Vardy 58); Arsenal 4 (Xhaka 25, Lacazette 55, Ramsey 79, Aubameyang 83) bt Fulham 1 (Kamara 69).|0|
Ganesh inks new contract with CFC|Chennai|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Chennaiyin FC midfielder Dhanpal Ganesh has signed a new three-year contract with the club, keeping him with the two-time Indian Super League champions till May 2022. “I am delighted to have renewed my contract with my home club. Chennaiyin FC have showed tremendous faith in me despite my knee injury, and I cannot wait to get back to the pitch and repay that faith. I also owe a lot of gratitude to my fans and followers, who have kept encouraging me while I continue my recuperation on the sidelines. “This season has not gone to plan yet, however we will focus ahead and aim to bounce back stronger in 2019 with plenty to play for including our historic AFC Cup campaign,” said an upbeat Ganesh. Ganesh was a pivotal figure in CFC’s 2017-18 title-winning side, making 17 appearances and scoring two crucial goals. The hard-tackling central midfielder aided the backline formidably and helped them keep eight clean sheets enroute to the ISL title. Ganesh has seven international caps to his name and he featured regularly in Stephen Constantine’s plans in the road to the AFC Asian Cup 2019. Ganesh is currently out with a knee injury suffered during pre-season but is set to feature in the New Year.|0|
Chera king’s devotion|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Those who are immersed in bhakti will see God in everything around them, said Sarala Rajagopalan, in a discourse. Perumakkodai was born in the Chera royal family But, he was not interested in the luxurious life of a king. He went to the temple in Thiruvanjikkalam, and served the deity there. He would bathe early in the morning, apply sacred ash on his forehead and then begin his service in the temple. If Perumakkodai chanced to see someone with sacred ash on his forehead, he would see that person as Lord Siva Himself. Chengoporaiyan was the king of Kodunkolur. He wanted to become a sanyasin. So, the ministers asked Perumakkodai to assume kingship. Perumakkodai was reluctant, because he was afraid that if he ascended the throne, he would be unable to serve the Lord. But Lord Siva asked him to accept the position, and to serve his people. The Lord gave him weapons, chariots and other things a king would need. Lord Siva also conferred on him the ability to know the thoughts of others. Because Perumakkkodai ruled the Chera kingdom, he came to be called Cheraman Perumal Nayanar. Because he was able to understand the needs of all living things, he was able to relieve them of suffering. One day, Cheraman Perumal Nayanar prayed at Thiruvanjikkalam, and then went around the streets of the town on his royal elephant. He saw a washerman, his body covered with lime, walking on the streets. To the king, whose mind was filled with thoughts of Lord Siva, it seemed as if the washerman’s body was covered with sacred ash. Taking him to be a devotee of Lord Siva, the king alighted from the elephant. He offered his respects to the washerman. The latter said, “I am a washerman.” And the king replied, “And I am your servant.” Such was Cheraman Perumal Nayanar’s bhakti.|0|
Kerala set for a hat-trick|Chennai|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Abdul Razak, a former International attacker, feels that Kerala men’s team is on the right track to achieve a hat-trick of titles and that his team would warm-up sufficiently. It takes on Karnataka in its first match in the 67th senior National volleyball championships scheduled at the Nehru Indoor Stadium here from January 2 to 10. Razak, who was the head coach of Kerala in the previous two editions as well, believes his team has a good player in all positions. “The only [minor] problem is that we didn’t have much time in the coaching camp as our State championship concluded on December 29 and that gave us little time to settle down, but that is not a setback for us,” the 58-year-old toldThe Hinduhere on Tuesday. On the other hand, T.C. Jothish, the head coach of Indian Railways, is not willing to pick a favourite. “All the eight teams in Group A and B are very good. We have almost retained the same team, with no major changes. We are looking forward to the event,” he said. Uttarakhand, which last won the title in 2002, and reached the final twice in 2011 & 2013, is blooding a young team, according to its coach Avnish Kumar Yadav. Costliest pick He said the team will feel the absence of setter Ranjit Singh, who is playing for Punjab here. For the record, Ranjit was the costliest pick in the Pro Volleyball League auction held in Mumbai recently. “We are preparing to build a team for the future. We are struggling, but we are keen to spring a surprise,” said Avnish. Host Tamil Nadu would be eager to prove a point under the new coach Mangala Jayapal. The nine-time champion, if the coach is to be believed, has a good mix of senior and junior players. On the women’s side, it will be difficult to look beyond Indian Railways, which will be going for its 11th straight title and 33rd overall. Groupings:  Men: A: Kerala, TN, Punjab, Karnataka; B: Railways, Services, Haryana, AP; C: Gujarat, Jharkhand, J&K, Chhattisgarh, Telangana; D: Uttarakhand, Assam, West Bengal, Chandigarh & Odisha; E: Rajasthan, Bihar, Manipur, Goa & Delhi; F: HP, MP, Maharashtra, Puducherry, UP, Tripura. Women: A: Railways, TN, West Bengal, Haryana; B: Kerala, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana; C: AP, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, J&K; D: UP, Bihar, MP & HP; E: Gujarat, Punjab, Manipur, Uttarakhand; F: Delhi, Chandigarh, Puducherry, Chhattisgarh, Odisha.|0|
RWITC’s clarification|MUMBAI|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|In order to clarify rumours that the RWITC has cancelled several Mumbai race days and so on, the stewards of the club have said in a press release that the RWITC Ltd has decided to cancel only one race day i.e. Thursday (January 3). Moreover, in view of the present financial crisis which the Club is passing through, the committee of the Club, at its meeting held on December 30, took the decision not to cancel any further race day and to continue racing throughout the season 2018-19, pay 75% of the advertised stakes for the races to be held in January 2019 and make no reduction in advertised stake-money of sweepstake and graded races. The decisions would be reviewed at the end of January.|0|
Federer wins Serena showdown|PERTH|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Roger Federer took the honours in the much-anticipated mixed doubles clash with fellow great Serena Williams in what the latter described as the “match of her career” at the Hopman Cup here on Tuesday. In the biggest mixed doubles drawcard in the 31-year history of the tournament, in what is expected to be its final edition, Federer teamed with Belinda Bencic to win 4-2, 4-3(5-3) under the Fast4 format over Serena and Francis Taifoe and the Group B tie for Switzerland. With 43 Grand Slam singles titles (Serena 23, Federer 20) and more than $200 million in prize money between them, the two 37-year-olds had welcomed the chance to face each other on the court in an official match for the first time. As it turned out, the tie was decided by the mixed doubles, after both Federer and Serena won their earlier singles matches. Serena, who seemed to be troubled by her right shoulder during the match but said it wasn’t a concern, was disappointed her doubles experience didn’t give the Americans the edge. However, even a rare defeat couldn’t take the gloss off the experience of facing Federer for the first, and almost certainly the only, time. “I was so excited and literally it was the match of my career,” she said. Federer said he was thrilled to play against one of the few players with more Grand Slam titles. If Switzerland beats Greece on Thursday, it will be through to the final. The results: Group B: Switzerland bt USA 2-1 [Roger Federer bt Frances Tiafoe 6-4, 6-1; Belinda Bencic lost to Serena Williams 6-4, 4-6, 3-6; Bencic & Federer bt Serena & Tiafoe 4-2, 4-3(5-3)].  I really enjoyed playing against Serena, what an honour and pleasure. I was nervous returning because people talk about her serve so much.— Federer  Playing someone so great and that you admire so much in a match that actually means something. It is really great and special to go against the greatest of all time.— Serena|0|

Selection headaches|CAPE TOWN|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|South Africa and Pakistan must resolve selection headaches ahead of the second Test starting at Newlands on Thursday. South Africa’s six-wicket win in the first Test at Centurion was set up by the bowling of Duanne Olivier, who had match figures of 11 for 96. Olivier got his chance because of an injury to Vernon Philander, who is fit again and will “definitely come back” to play at his home ground, according to captain Faf du Plessis. Philander has taken 49 wickets in nine Tests at Newlands at an average of 16.55. Despite his performance at Centurion, Olivier is unlikely to be picked ahead of Kagiso Rabada, who finished 2018 as the world’s top-ranked Test bowler, or Dale Steyn, South Africa’s all-time leading wicket-taker. Nor is South Africa likely to risk going into a Test at Newlands without spinner Keshav Maharaj. Which means Olivier will only play at the expense of a specialist batsman, with Theunis de Bruyn the most likely to make way. Pakistan will also be welcoming back a first-choice fast bowler in Mohammad Abbas, with captain Sarfraz Ahmed saying after Centurion that Abbas had fully recovered from a shoulder injury. Also fit after missing the first Test is batsman Haris Sohail, who seems certain to return.|0|

Sydney gets the year wrong at celebration|Sydney|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The spectacular fireworks show on Sydney’s harbour that rang in 2019 and dazzled spectators around the world was picture perfect, except for one element — it got the year wrong. More than 1.5 million people packed the harbour front of Australia’s largest city to watch the extravaganza, and noticed a signage beamed onto one of the Sydney Harbour Bridge’s pylons had the words “Happy New Year 2018!” Photos of the typo were shared on social media sites. “According to Sydney, it’s still 2018, so I’m going back to bed,” one Twitter user quipped. Another wrote: “Oh will this horrible year never end.” Organisers the City of Sydney, who invested huge resources and time into planning one of the world’s first New Year’s parties, saw the funny side of the mistake. “We just laughed about it, you know these things happen as we said, it takes 15 months to organise an event of this size and scale,” the fireworks’ executive producer Anna McInerney said.|0|
Can algorithms show the path to happiness?|Mountain View|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Technology companies like to promote artificial intelligence’s potential for solving some of the world’s toughest problems, like reducing automobile deaths and helping doctors diagnose diseases. A company started by three former Google employees is pitching AI as the answer to a more common problem: being happier at work. The startup, Humu, is based in Google’s hometown, and it builds on some of the people-analytics programs pioneered by the Internet giant, which has studied things like the traits that define great managers and how to foster better teamwork. Humu wants to bring similar data-driven insights to other companies. It digs through employee surveys using artificial intelligence to identify one or two behavioural changes that are likely to make the biggest impact on elevating a work force’s happiness. Timely nudges Then it uses emails and text messages to “nudge” individual employees into small actions that advance the larger goal. At a company where workers feel that the way decisions are made is opaque, Humu might nudge a manager before a meeting to ask the members of her team for input and to be prepared to change her mind. At the heart of Humu’s efforts is the company’s “nudge engine” (yes, it’s trademarked). It is based on economist Richard Thaler’s Nobel Prize-winning research into how people often make decisions because of what is easier rather than what is in their best interest, and how a well-timed nudge can prompt them to make better choices. “Often we want to be better people,” said Laszlo Bock, Humu’s chief executive and Google’s former leader of what the company calls people operations, or human resources. “We want to be the person we hope we can be. But we need to be reminded. A nudge can have a powerful impact if correctly deployed on how people behave and on human performance.” Sanjiv Razdan, the chief operating officer at Sweetgreen, a salad chain and one of Humu’s customers, said that if nudges did not have a track record at Google, he would probably consider the concept a bunch of “hocus-pocus happiness nonsense.” But after receiving nudges for a few months himself in emails, Mr. Razdan said the bite-size reminders made it easy to take action right away. In one instance, he said, he was prompted to ask members of his team for their opinions on decisions he was facing.NY TIMES|0|
Kader Khan — the actor who wrote the best lines|Mumbai|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Kader Khan’s career in Hindi cinema seemed split into two — the screenwriter and the actor; further when it came to acting, there were the villains he played as against the comedians; and, in terms of the star eras, there was the Amitabh Bachchan phase that led later into the Govinda years. Through all the years, encompassing hundreds of films, Khan remained at the top of his game, specially as a writer. He died on Monday at the age of 81. Khan would be best remembered as the influential writer who defined entertainment in the 70s and the 80s and guided film-making of the time in his own way. So Amitabh Bachchan may have been the face of Prakash Mehra’sSharaabi(1984)but look closely and the film is sustained on the streetside lingo and dialoguebaazithat Khan wrote. Khan was prolific in his output which traversed many genres — family, social, political, action, comedy, romance. Rough childhood Born and raised in the midst of poverty in Kamathipura, a lot of his early struggles, the deprivation and pain, also made its way into the scenarios of films likeLaawaris(1981)andMuqaddar Ka Sikandar(1978). The graveyard scene in the latter draws from his own childhood when he used to run away to the cemetery to sit between the graves and enact scenes from what he saw and experienced during the day and declaim random lines. It was there that he was spotted by theatreperson Ashraf Khan and steered towards the stage. An engineer by training, who became a professor of civil engineering, Khan often claimed that his first love had always been theatre. “I used to teach the theory of structure, hydraulics, strength of material, RCC steel, but my subjects which I used to like were theatre, Stanislavsky, Maxim Gorky, Chekhov, Dostoevsky — these are my other teachers. So my life was split into two,” he said in an interview to Connie Haham, author of the biographyEnchantment of the Mind: Manmohan Desai’s Films. Producer Ramesh Behl of Rose Movies approached Khan to write a film and so Narendra Bedi’sJawani Diwani(1972) marked his debut as a writer. He claimed to have written the film in four hours flat and the shoot for it started within three days of him having wrapped it up, a record of sorts. He got Rs. 1500 for the film, a royal sum considering he hadn’t earned more than Rs. 500 before that. A few years later, the dialogue forKhel Khel Mein(1975) earned him Rs. 10,000, he recollected in the Haham interview. Master of patois Khan’s words were witty, satirical, dramatic. His signature style was all about the use of colloquial idiom, street patois and everyday language and speech. All stitched perfectly to the character. It was what endeared him to filmmaker Manmohan Desai. As per the Haham interview Desai gifted him a Panasonic TV, a golden bracelet and Rs. 25,000 on hearing the narration ofRoti(1974) and increased his writing fee from Rs. 25,000 to Rs. 1lakh. Like Salim-Javed, Khan was a star-writer of the times. He was also a rare one to have balanced himself between the two big Bollywood camps — of Desai and Prakash Mehra. The list of hits for both includesAmar Akbar Anthony(1977),Dharam Veer(1977),Coolie(1983) andGanga Jamuna Saraswati(1988) on the one hand andMuqaddar Ka Sikandar(1978),Laawaris(1981) andSharaabi(1984) on the other. Transcending geography He wasn’t just divided between the two. There was also a third force that came to work later. He was also much sought after by the Southern production houses such as Padmalaya — and filmmakers like K. Raghavendra Rao, K. Bapaiah, Dasari Narayan Rao, D. Rama Naidu— to do the script and dialogue for the Hindi remakes of their films. These includedHimmatwala(1983),Justice Choudhury(1983),Mawaali(1983),Tohfa(1984),Haisiyat(1984),Naya Kadam(1984), andSinghasan(1986). He didn’t just translate the original films into Hindi but transposed them into a new North setting, culture, context and language. Khan’s innings in acting kicked off with Rajesh Khanna’s romantic court-room drama on bigamyDaag(1973), where he played an attorney. A lot of the strength of his performances emanated from the timbre of his voice, the easily identifiable baritone. In fact one of his filmsBenaam(1974) is all about the voice. He is the title character but not present in the film, only heard. In his later years he formed a formidable comic pair with Govinda — be it the many ‘No.1’ films, speciallyHero No. 1(1997) or aDulhe Raja(1998).|0|
Parallel Lit Fest to begin on Jan. 27|Jaipur|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The second edition of Parallel Literature Festival (PLF), which started last year as an answer to the Jaipur Literature Festival, will be organised here from January 27 to 29 to provide a forum to distinguished personalities from the fields of literature, art, culture and cinema. Speakers have been invited from 20 States as well as from Sri Lanka and Nepal. Creativity will be showcased on the lush green lawns, art galleries, studio theatre and open air theatre of Jaipur’s cultural centre, Ravindra Manch, where the three-day event will be held. The six stages to be set up at the venue will be named after the writers and books of the Progressive Writers’ Movement. The PLF-2019 has been dedicated to Urdu writer Razia Sajjad Zaheer, who was born in Ajmer, as the country celebrates her birth centenary year. The festival’s chief convenor Ish Madhu Talwar said here on Tuesday that Ravindra Manch would be named and decorated as “Razia Gram” to commemorate the celebrated author. ‘Against corporatisation’ Mr. Talwar, general secretary of the Rajasthan Progressive Writers’ Association, said the growing “lit fest merchandise culture”, which aimed at corporatisation of literature and arts, was anathema to initiatives like the PLF. He said the PLF was opposed to the nexus among the tourism, hotel and publication industries for holding big literary events.|0|

The furriest ones|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|People have always coveted the thick, soft, warm and durable coats of various animals, ranging from the Arctic fox, muskox, ermine and chinchilla to the mink, sable and vicuna. Even otters, rabbits and goats are not spared. There are only two species of the rodent called chinchilla and both are critically endangered in the wild. They live at heights of 2500-6000 m in the Andes Mountains of South America where it is bitterly cold in winter. To survive the extreme weather, chinchillas grow very dense fur, with more than 50 fine hairs growing from each follicle. The fur is bluish to brownish grey and yellowish white on the underparts. Chinchilla fur is considered the softest in the world and the animals were hunted almost to extinction for their coats in the 19th century. The medium-sized rodents are now bred in farms in coats of various colours. The endangered sea otter has a thick, soft, waterproof coat of fur adapted to its semi-aquatic lifestyle. The otters were hunted almost to extinction for their pelts. There were only 2000 otters left in the wild till trade in their fur was banned in 1911. Sea otters have two layers of fur. The inner layer closest to the skin provides insulation and is protected by waterproof guard hairs. This combination of warmth and waterproofing meant that their coats were especially coveted. The sea otter is the furriest creature on Earth. When scientists compared the hair densities of Eurasian otters and sea otters, they found that while the former have 80,000 hairs per sq. cm of skin, the latter have an amazing 140,000 hairs per sq. cm! In comparison, Arctic foxes and chinchillas have 20,000 hairs per sq. cm while a muskox comes a poor third at 420! Sea otters lack the thick layer of blubber under the skin that all other marine mammals such as walruses and seals have to keep them warm and aid them in buoyancy. Adults have to keep their own coats and their pups' coats spanking clean because dirt can make it less waterproof and buoyant.|0|
A man of many parts|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Bachchan, Jeetendra, Govinda — action, emotion, comedy. Kader Khan wrote the entire spectrum of ‘filmi’ emotions in an extremely durable writing career of about 30 years. A look at some of his films: Amar Akbar Anthony: “Aise toh aadmi life mein doich time bhaagta hai, Olympic ka race ho ya police ka case ho!” drawled Anthony-bhaiin typical Mumbaitaporilingo. Manmohan Desai’s favourite dialogue-writer, Khan endeared himself to the director by using everyday language, coming up with punchlines and doing so at a speed that matched the maker’s scorching pace. Muqaddar Ka Sikandar: “Zinda hai who log jo maut se takrate hain. Murdo se badtar hai woh log jo maut se ghabrate hain… Taqdeer tere kadmon mein hogi aur tu muqaddar ka badshah hoga…” With these lines, Kader Khan made it big with Prakash Mehra as well, writing dialogues that would transport Amitabh Bachchan from a superstar to a megastar. Himmatwala: “Tumhari loot maar ko khatam karke, tumhari zabardasti ki hukumat ko ujaadne wala, himmatwala,” screamed the hero. A misunderstanding with Bachchan saw Khan move to the south for a slew of films (many starring Jeetendra). Some of his scripts were criticised for their crass humour but Khan clearly knew the audience’s pulse as all of them were wildly popular with the masses. Agneepath: “Yeh chhe foot ka body ludkane ke liye chaar inch ka goli kam pad gaya, maloom?” Probably his best script, Khan revealed in an interview that he had recorded all the lines on a tape and given it to Bachchan to help him understand the voice modulation and delivery. The lines became cult classics and Bachchan’s performance won a National Award. Coolie No. 1: “Duniya mera ghar hai, bus stand mera adda hai, jab mann kare aa jaana, Raju mera naam hai aur pyar se log mujhe bulaate hain Coolie number one”. Khan handled the Bachchan-Govinda transition with aplomb. By now, his original hero was a pale shadow of himself but he was still writing whistle-inducing dialogues for the Hero No. 1. ******** Comedy, villainy, conscience-keeping. Probably due to Khan’s super-prolific output, his landmark roles tend to get lost and he doesn’t get enough credit for the wide range of roles — many of which he wrote the lines for! Inquilaab: Kader Khan’s stellar career as a menacing, conniving villain is epitomised by this character — an unscrupulous political leader who manipulates Amitabh Bachchan’s character. His measured movements and deliberate dialogue delivery were an asset for this ‘mastermind’ kind of roles. Baap Numbri Beta Dus Numbri: Kader Khan stopped being a villain quite emotionally when he saw his sons getting ridiculed and even beaten up for his negative roles. He started doing comic roles in the mid-1980s and soon formed a partnership with Shakti Kapoor (who often called Kader Khan his guru). This film is one of their more hilarious outings, where the comic duo called the shots! Hum: In a double role, Kader Khan played an Army General and anautankiactor. The former was a‘kadak’soldier and had quite a few sharp lines about patriotism while the latter was bit of a flake with silly lines by the dozen. In the film, the latter was called on to replace the former and Khan uncorked mayhem! Angaar: An under-discussed but complex role, where he played Jahangir Khan, a benevolent don ruling over Mumbai. His ego was intertwined with his benevolence, his benevolence at odds with his love for his sons and the love for his sons overshadowed by his ego. It was neither a villainous nor a heroic character and Khan brought interesting dimensions to it.  (The writer has authored five books, four of which are on Hindi cinema)|0|

Assam most vulnerable to climate change in the Himalayan range, says study|Guwahati:|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|"The Himalayan region supports about 20 percent of the worlds population. But the ecologically fragile region, the storehouse of the third-highest amount of frozen water on Earth, is highly vulnerable to climate change. Among the 12 states in the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR), Assam is found to be the most vulnerable to the changing climate, according to a Department of Science and Technology (DST) vulnerability assessment. The study, ""Climate Vulnerability Assessment for the Indian Himalayan Region Using a Common Framework"", was done by the Indian Institute of Technology-Guwahati and the Indian Institute of Technology-Mandi in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, to help understand climate change vulnerabilities which could inform development of adaptation strategies and ecosystem management for the Himalayan region. The assessment is significant for India as a majority of its population is dependent on agriculture which requires water. The Himalayas are a source of many rivers which supply this water. Bordering eight countries, the Himalayan mountain range is the tallest in the world. It covers an area of about 4.3 million square kilometres and nearly 1.5 billion people depend on it for water, food and energy. In India, the IHR spans across 12 states – Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura, Meghalaya, Assam and (hill districts of) West Bengal. The vulnerability assessment was done on the basis of four major factors: Socio-economic, demographic status and health, the sensitivity of agricultural production, forest-dependent livelihoods and access to information services.

Chronicle of the undead|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Blame it on Stephanie Meyer’s best-selling ‘Twilight’ series. You begin wishing that your best friend was a vampire. You begin wishing that you had other friends who could transform into interesting animals at the drop of a hat. Such is the interest in Meyer’s books that even Bram Stroker, who created the genre with the singular ‘Dracula’, has been wondering at the renewed interest in the genre. The popularity of the Twilight series has spawned a thousand rip-offs. Writers went berserk trying to imagine the trials and tribulations of being a bloodsucking being in a human world. Naturally, not every vampire book published is as good as the original. But if you’re a genuine fan of vampire fiction and want to explore more of the genre, here are some suggestions for you.|0|
Body first, ranking later says Nadal after ankle surgery|Brisbane|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Spanish superstar Rafael Nadal insisted on Tuesday he is not chasing the world's top ranking as he prepares to make a comeback from ankle surgery, with taking care of his body a key priority. The current world number two has not played a main tour event since a knee problem forced him to retire during his US Open semi-final against Juan Martin del Potro in September. The 32-year-old had surgery on his ankle in November to remove a loose intra-articular body and only resumed training three weeks ago. He played the opening round at an exhibition event in Abu Dhabi last week, where he lost to South African Kevin Anderson, and gets his season proper under way in the second round of the Brisbane International on Thursday. The 17-time Grand Slam winner said he hadn't been worried about the world rankings for the past two years. ‘My goal is just to be happy’ “My goal is just to be happy doing what I am doing and be competitive all the weeks that I am playing,” he said. “I want to feel myself competitive every week that I am on court and I want to keep fighting for the things that really make me feel alive, you know, for the things that motivate me. “So I will not (chase) the number one because it's not my main goal. “Of course, I prefer to be number one than number two, and I prefer to be number two than number five, that's obvious,” he added. Nadal was forced to retire during matches at two of the four Grand Slams in 2018, but still added a record-extending 11th French Open crown to his collection. He said he wanted to ensure he could take care of his body to allow him to keep playing as long as possible because of his love for the game. “Really my only goal is to keep doing the things that makes me happy, and today playing tennis makes me happy, and I want to do it the best way possible and as long as possible.” AFP|0|
Oddest news of the year 2018|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|"Abhi:Sid, why do you keep switching channels? Let’s us watch the news properly. Sid:I am tired of watching news of natural disasters, accidents and political rows. It is the end of the year, and I am keen to watch a nice programme. Abhi:Hmmm, I am interested in news and you prefer something light. Why don’t we talk about some offbeat news stories of the year 2018? Sid:Like what? Abhi:Like the one about a pet African grey parrot, which used its owner's Amazon Alexa device to order a range of items including watermelons, raisins, broccoli, ice cream, light bulb and a kite. It seems it would mindlessly activate Alexa and have the virtual assistant tell jokes and play music. Sid(Laughs out loud):Oh my god! That’s so funny. I am not surprised because African grey parrots are famous for their ability to mimic speech. Abhi:True. And what I found even funnier was about a nine-year-old boy who, when introduced to the Queen of England at an event felt overwhelmed and crawled his way out of the room. You should watch the video. It’s hilarious. He even shouted out a “Bye” from the doorstep. Sid:Sure, will watch the video. The news story that touched me deeply was about a 13-year-old girl who left a note behind for the new owners of her house. Charlotte Gardner and her family had to move out of their home in Glasgow, Scotland. Before she left, Charlotte left a touching letter under her room's carpet. It read, ""I lived in this house for 11 years and this was my bedroom... I am moving out in two days on Friday and I am really upset and sad. Look after my house for me."" This was back in 2007. About 11 years and 10 months later, the letter was found by the new homeowner, Martin, when he revamped the house, and he shared it on Twitter. The story does not end there. The Twitter post found its way to Charlotte Gardner herself, who now lives in Bath, the U.K. She thanked Martin for taking her back to her childhood days in her reply post. Abhi:Wow! That’s really moving. Talking of letters, I recall reading this one in a newspaper. A man lost his wallet when he visited Las Vegas for his sister’s wedding. It contained $60, a $400 paycheck, his bank card and his identification card. He returned to South Dakota, after spending the weekend on borrowed money. The day after he reached home, he received a package. It contained his wallet – completely intact – with a note that said: ‘P.S. I rounded your cash up to an even $100 so you could celebrate getting your wallet back. Have Fun!!!"" Sid:Wow! I am stunned by this gesture. You know what’s my favourite oddest news of the year? It’s about the Missouri court judgment against a deer poacher. Abhi:Why? What happened? Sid:David Berry Jr, a hunter, was convicted of illegally killing ""hundreds"" of deer. On top of the jail sentence, the judge ordered Berry Jr to ""view the Walt Disney movieBambi,once every month during his spell in prison.Bambiis a 1942 cartoon about a deer character Bambi.

Reindeer population on the decline|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Continued warming of the Arctic is driving broad changes in the environmental system. The 2018 Arctic Report Card released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, an American scientific agency, has thrown light on way the Arctic has changed over the year due to climate change. Among the points highlighted in the report is the decline of the reindeer population. It says that over the past two decades, the population of reindeer has crashed by 56 per cent from about 4.7 million animals to 2.1 million. According to the NOAA press release, population fall has been noted across the reindeer habitat. As many as 22 herds in North America, Greenland, Russia and Norway, were monitored for the study. The report says that except two herds, which are at their at historic peak numbers, other have declined.  • Causes of the decline are complex and related to a combination of factors, says NOAA. They include hunting, disease, diminished food availability and climate change. • Longer, warmer summers mean more vegetation for them to feed on, but they also mean a boom in disease-causing parasites. Heat stress also leads to increased susceptibility to pathogens. Warmer summers have also meant that diseases, long locked in the Arctic permafrost, may thaw and spread among herds. • Warmer days mean more insects plaguing the animals, who use more energy swatting and shrugging off biting insects or trying to find insect-free pastures. • An increase in rain can be a problem, too. Wet weather leaves behind a frozen layer on top of the snow, making it harder for the animals to break through the ice to feed on lichen.  Reindeer are important to the Arctic ecosystem as they are a source of food, clothing and livelihood for local people. Massive herds of deer roam the tundra, shaping the vegetation of the region by grazing. They are also a source of food for predators such as wolves.|0|
What comes before and after...|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST| Prefixes and suffixes are not words and hence cannot stand on their own in a sentence. Most prefixes and suffixes are derived from Greek and Latin words.  PREFIX A prefix is a letter or a group of letters that we add to the beginning of the word. Adding a prefix changes the meaning of the word. For example, the prefix ‘un’ means not or remove. When you add ‘un’ to happy, it becomes unhappy, which means not happy. The prefix ‘dis’ also means not. When added to like it becomes dislike, meaning not like. The prefix ‘re’ means again, so when it is added to the word, pay it becomes repay, which means pay again. The prefix ‘mis’ means wrong. When added to the word behave it becomes misbehave, which means behave in a wrong way. ‘Pre’ means before. When added to the word finals it becomes prefinals, which means before the finals. Let’s take a look at some more prefixes, what they mean and how hey’re used. • De - Off - Derail, Degrade • Im - Not - Impossible, Impatient • Il - Not - Illegal, Illogical • In - Not - Indefinite, Incapable • Ir - Not - Irresponsible, Irrational • Non - Without - Nonsense, Non-vegetarian  SUFFIX A suffix is a letter or a group of letters that we add at the end of a word. The addition of a suffix changes a word from one class to another. For example, when you add the suffix ‘ness’ to happy, it becomes happiness. Similarly, when the suffix ‘ly’ is added, it becomes happily. Happy is an adjective, happiness is a noun, happily is an adverb. Let’s look at another example. The word success is a noun. Add the suffix ‘ful’ and it becomes successful, which is an adjective. Here are a few more suffixes that can be added to words. • Ness - Kindness • Ish - Childish • Ment - Movement • Less - Useless • Ence - Dependence • Ful - Careful • Tion - Promotion • Able - Capable • Ance - Attendance • Dom - Kingdom   I.

Sanchez eager for return: Solskjaer|Manchester|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|After scoring 12 goals in three games under caretaker manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Manchester United could add another weapon to their attacking arsenal at Newcastle on Wednesday, with Alexis Sanchez set to return from injury. The Chilean has been sidelined by a hamstring injury for the past month, meaning he missed the final days of Jose Mourinho's reign in charge at Old Trafford. Sanchez was signed to much fanfare last January from Arsenal on reportedly the most lucrative contract in Premier League history, but has so far failed to deliver on expectations, scoring just four goals in 30 appearances. However, Solskjaer believes the more positive approach he has adopted in wins over Cardiff, Huddersfield and Bournemouth to begin his temporary spell in charge until the end of the season will suit Sanchez's game. “He's a player that would benefit from the rotation (of positions) and movements, and the more chances you create, the more times you get the ball into the final third, he'll be an asset for us,” said Solskjaer. “I think he's looking forward to it. It certainly looked like it yesterday (Saturday) in the (training) session because he scored quite a few nice goals, so that's encouraging.” Solskjaer has been credited for restoring United's principles of attacking football after two-and-a-half seasons with Mourinho's more cautious approach.

How cool is that?|Christchurch|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|New Zealand celebrated a historic victory on Sunday when they needed just 14 balls on day five to demolish Sri Lanka by a colossal 423 runs in the second Test in Christchurch. “That's quite a cool thing to achieve,” skipper Kane Williamson said, reflecting on New Zealand winning a fourth consecutive series for the first time in their 88-year Test history. “That wasn't the focus, and if we do reflect on that a little bit, the positives of the different conditions we've experienced, the different opposition all come into the fact we've been able to get across the line and that makes it quite special.” Biggest ever margin The victory over Sri Lanka, by the biggest ever margin for New Zealand and eighth largest of all time in terms of runs, followed back-to-back series wins against the West Indies, England and Pakistan this year. Sri Lanka, having been set an improbable 660-run target, resumed the final day at 231 for six and lost their first wicket with the third ball of the morning when Trent Boult bowled Suranga Lakmal for 18. Neil Wagner removed Dilruwan Perera for 22 before Boult ended the innings with the wicket of Dushmantha Chameera in the third over of the morning. Angelo Mathews, who retired hurt when on 22 on Saturday, did not resume his innings. Key moment  When Kusal Mendis and Dinesh Chandimal were at the crease they had a faint hope, but a stunning catch by Matt Henry broke the stubborn partnership. “That was the key moment,” Williamson said of Henry's diving catch at extra cover to remove Mendis for 67 off the bowling of Neil Wagner to end a 53-over stand.

Chelsea’s Kante growing into new role|London|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|N'Golo Kante insists he is finally growing into his new role in Chelsea's midfield as the France star prepares for Wednesday's clash with Southampton. Kante earned a reputation as the world's best defensive midfielder after playing a key role in Chelsea and Leicester's Premier League title triumphs, as well as France's World Cup victory. But the 27-year-old has had to adapt to a change of position this season under new Chelsea manager Maurizio Sarri. Sarri, who replaced Antonio Conte in the close-season, brought Jorginho with him from Napoli to play the pivotal midfield role in front of the defence that used to be Kante's domain. Sarri believes Jorginho's superior passing makes him more suited to launching Chelsea's attacks than Kante, who is now operating in a slightly more advanced role on the right of midfield. Kante has sometimes looked out of sorts in his different position this season, but he showed signs of getting to grips with it on Sunday, scoring the winner at Crystal Palace with a well-timed run and cool finish. “This role is something I am enjoying and in a game I try to make that run sometimes,” Kante said. Away wins at Watford and Palace made it a happy Christmas for Chelsea. AFP|0|

Why early flowering is a cause for concern|Washington:|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Rising temperatures in tundra regions -- such as the Arctic, the Antarctic and high elevation mountains – are causing plants to flower earlier, a phenomenon that can disrupt the food chain, a study has found. Plants and animals in cold regions take cues from weather and day length to start their annual life cycles. Successful pollination relies on animals, including bees, beetles, birds and mosquitoes, being active at the same time plants are flowering. Shorter flowering seasons can disrupt the food chain and how plants and pollinators in tundras interact with each other, said Steven Oberbauer, of Florida International University in the US. Shorter flowering time in tundras could cause a mismatch if the animals are not following the same cues as plants. Specifically, it could limit food availability, increase competition and impact their ability to survive in a changing environment. Tundras are home mostly to dwarf shrubs, grasses, mosses and lichens. The research team examined more than 10 years of data on the flowering times of more than 250 species from the tundra environments of North America, Europe and Australia. PTI|0|

Small changes in oxygen levels have big implications for ocean life: Study|Washington:|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST| Even slight levels of ocean oxygen loss, or deoxygenation, have big consequences for tiny marine organisms called zooplankton, according to a study. Zooplankton are important components of the food web in the expanse of deep, open ocean called the midwater, said researchers from the University of Rhode Island in the US. Within this slice of ocean below the surface and above the seafloor are oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), large regions of very low oxygen, according to the study published in the journal Science Advances. Unlike coastal “dead zones” where oxygen levels can suddenly plummet and kill marine life not acclimated to the conditions, zooplankton in OMZs are specially adapted to live where other organisms -- especially predators -- cannot. However, OMZs are expanding due to climate change, and even slight changes to the low oxygen levels can push zooplankton beyond their extraordinary physiological limits. “Although the animals in the ocean’s oxygen minimum zone have adapted over millions of years to the very low oxygen of this extreme and widespread midwater habitat, they are living at the very limits of their physiological capability,” said Karen Wishner, a professor at University of Rhode Island.PTI|0|

Red-hot Harden lifts Rockets, Westbrook bounces back|Los Angeles|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|James Harden posted a 43-point triple-double on another record-setting night on Monday to lead the Houston Rockets to a 113-101 NBA victory over the Memphis Grizzlies. Harden, the reigning NBA Most Valuable Player, added 13 assists and 10 rebounds for his fourth triple-double of the season and 39th of his career. And with his eighth straight game with at least 35 points and five assists he set an NBA record – bettering Oscar Robertson's two such seven-game streaks. Harden drained six three-pointers and made 21 of his 27 free throws and the Rockets led by as many as 24 before Memphis sliced the deficit to nine points with 1:26 to play. A free throw from P.J. Tucker and a layup by Austin Rivers helped rebuild the lead as the Rockets continued to win despite the injury absence of point guard Chris Paul. “Offensively and defensively guys are stepping up,” Harden said. “We've got a long way to go, but we're heading in the right direction.” The Oklahoma City Thunder rode point guard Russell Westbrook's triple-double to a 122-102 home victory over the Dallas Mavericks, a day after falling to the Mavs in Dallas. Westbrook, who said after his disappointing nine-point performance in Dallas that he was letting his team-mates down, bounced back in a big way with 32 points, 11 assists and 11 rebounds. Paul George added 22 points and Jerami Grant chipped in 16 for the Thunder, who never trailed. Warriors eclipse Suns The two-time defending NBA champion Golden State Warriors closed out 2018 with a 132-109 victory over the Suns in Phoenix. Stephen Curry scored 34 points and pulled down nine rebounds. Kevin Durant added 25 points and Klay Thompson chipped in 15 for the Warriors, who led by as many as 30.

Developing sustainable plastics|Jerusalem:|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Scientists have developed biodegradable plastics derived from microorganisms that feed on seaweed which produces zero toxic waste and can be recycled into organic waste. According to the United Nations, plastic accounts for up to 90 per cent of all the pollutants in our oceans, yet there are few comparable, environmentally friendly alternatives to the material. “Plastics take hundreds of years to decay. So bottles, packaging and bags create plastic ‘continents’ in the oceans, endanger animals and pollute the environment,” said Alexander Golberg from Tel Aviv University in Israel.  “A partial solution to the plastic epidemic is bioplastics, which don’t use petroleum and degrade quickly. But bioplastics also have an environmental price: To grow the plants or the bacteria to make the plastic requires fertile soil and fresh water, which many countries, including Israel, don’t have,” said Golberg. “Our new process produces ‘plastic’ from marine microorganisms that completely recycle into organic waste,” he said. The researchers harnessed microorganisms that feed on seaweed to produce a bioplastic polymer called polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA). “Our raw material was multicellular seaweed, cultivated in the sea,” Golberg said. “These algae were eaten by single-celled microorganisms, which also grow in very salty water and produce a polymer that can be used to make bioplastic,” he said. “There are already factories that produce this type of bioplastic in commercial quantities, but they use plants that require agricultural land and fresh water,” Golberg said. “The process we propose will enable countries with a shortage of fresh water, such as Israel, China and India, to switch from petroleum-derived plastics to biodegradable plastics,” he said. Researchers could revolutionise the world’s efforts to clean the oceans, without affecting arable land and without using fresh water. “Plastic from fossil sources is one of the most polluting factors in the oceans,” he said. “We have proved it is possible to produce bioplastic completely based on marine resources in a process that is friendly both to the environment and to its residents,” he added. “We are now conducting basic research to find the best bacteria and algae that would be most suitable for producing polymers for bioplastics with different properties,” he added.PTI  The process we propose will enable countries with a shortage of fresh water, such as Israel, China and India, to switch from petroleum-derived plastics to biodegradable plastics|0|

The first time I…|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The first time Iwitnessed how car-crazy Italians really are I’ve heard about car-mad Italians heading to Fiorano just to be able to stand outside Ferrari’s test track and watch through the cracks on the walls while the supercar maker’s drivers tested their latest cars. But to witness first-hand how passionate they are was a different experience all together. I was in Maranello, Italy, to test-drive the 458 Italia; it was just a few days since the convertible had been launched. Getting on to the highway near Ferrari’s wind tunnel facility was easy in the morning and I was taking the opportunity to drive top-down despite the nip in the air. Surprisingly, I kept hearing a lot of honking, something that is very rare on European roads. It was only after a truck driver from two lanes away honked and waved to me that I realised that they were all appreciating the car. All through the day while I drove, other cars would pull close and passengers would stick their heads out to shout ‘Bellissimo’ (handsome; alas not me!). At the lunch and coffee stops, random people came up to see the car and strike up a conversation, including a few cops. Heading back to the hotel in the evening, I was accosted by a couple of drivers in Lamborghinis who sandwiched me in between and wanted me to race them. That one sweeping, windy stretch of the highway was reverberating with the angry exhaust notes of three super cars.  Consulting Motoring Editor,The Hindu BusinessLine|0|
A mournful coo|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|"When we were kids in Bangalore, rice was always cleaned by the house help, with a woven bamboo sieve. The help sat in the back verandah and very skillfully threw the rice up and down in the air, getting rid of any chaff and broken grain. Then from the trees in the garden the doves would fly down from the Avocado trees, with an explosive flutter of wings or sometimes glide down to busily tip-toe up, to pick at the broken grain. These were the Spotted dove (Spilopelia chinensis), a small and somewhat long-tailed pigeon that is a common resident breeding bird across India. The Red Collared Dove ( Streptopelia tranquebarica) is a different genus and difficult for birders to spot in Bangalore. That is why there is huge excitement when a birder spots one and also clicks a picture to share. Srikanth BS, who is a camera enthusiast, says, “ I have been a lucky shutterbug living in the Garden city. My weekends are motivated with bird watching and photography. These doves are among the few varieties found on the ground, in residential areas, occasionally in pairs. The markings on neck vary from rufous, one dark stripe or small patch on neck sides identifying their sub species. In Greek mythology, a servant complained bitterly about a salary of just 18 pieces of silver a year, and the gods changed her to a dove that still cries mournfully” “ This beautiful bird, is rare to see, to say the very least. Getting to see my first one took quite a bit of effort. Having searched for them unsuccessfully around Bangalore at several known locations, I finally got to see one in Tal Chhapar in Rajasthan"", says Thomas Job. But several Bangalore Birders have seen the beautifully colour toned bird in the outskirts of the city. According to a bird site, the bird comes under the category of ‘Pigeons and Doves’ and the males are around 22 cm in size. The bird has a deep ashy-grey head; black hind-neck collar, a rich wine-red back; slaty grey-brown lower back. The female is a dull brown and smaller in size, unlike the flamboyant male bird. They can be found in singles, pairs or small groups which feed on ground, searching through harvest waste on agricultural fields. Kumar R.R. another birder in the city says wryly, “ The red collared dove is still elusive for me. I haven't seen one yet. I was hoping to see one in GKVK campus today but no luck.”"|0|
Rocking on diligently|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|In the years that they’ve lied somewhat dormant on the city’s live circuit, Bangaluru rock band Coma Rossi seems to have been diligently putting together its self-titled debut album. The emphasis is on diligently because Coma Rossi clocks in with eight tracks totalling to around 67 minutes. Like most bands, what is evident is thatComa Rossiis an amalgamation of different influences coming together – you can hear a little bit of Dream Theater and Opeth-like progressive rock/metal grandiosity, the Tool-like dexterity and more. And this is just all on their opening track ‘Mirage’, which sets the scene for mammoth, spiralling rock. They turn to ambient rock led movements, not too far removed from the space rock of Pink Floyd on ‘Transmission’, but in their regular steady build-ups on songs like the mostly instrumental ‘Jomolungma Is Far Away’, they end up putting too much emphasis on structure for effect, when they may as well just cut to the chase and get to the gripping parts. Of course, what you get in the process of being a patient listener through the course of an hour is the glimmering skill of everyone in the band – guitarist Gaurav Govilkar, keyboardist Juby Thomas, lead vocalist and guitarist Tom Borah and Udayan Kashalikar on bass and Anupam Panda on drums. They offer no such build-up on the ephemeral ‘Yellow Escape’, which shows off Coma Rossi’s post-rock hues, easily a stand-out track on its own for stargazing nights. Their opus and centrepiece is ‘Dream’, which is about 14-minutes long and retains their cohesive space-rock styling. While Borah’s vocals doesn’t offer always something new like on ‘Stillborn’, there’s mind-bending riffs on display to save it from becoming filler material. Where Borah does finally shine is on the penultimate track ‘Turn Back Time’, an exuberant track that morphs into an emotive plea, placed over cascading drum-work. The closing track ‘Lost’ comes in at a mellow pace, a tad languid but not necessarily in a bad way. Even at over an hour,Coma Rossiisn’t thankfully entirely a laborious listen, because it’s made for prog fans, injected with ambient rock for good effect.

Making a mark|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Ashraf Khan always dreamt of being an actor. With no connection to the film industry, the task seemed an uphill journey for him. “We were exposed to a lot of classical music as my father worked as a tabla artiste with the AIR, Delhi,” explains Ashraf, who soon started accompanying his father to his concerts and was noticed by a modelling agency and bagged his first assignment. “That boosted my confidence and I took to theatre,” shares the actor, who then shifted his base to Mumbai. But, filmdom seemed distant for Ashraf, who then started getting involved in theatre and soon established himself as an actor. That opened more doors for modelling and now he has signed a Hindi film,Mumbai Pipeline,which he says will go on floors later this month. Ashraf is also thrilled he has bagged his first Kannada film --Laila Majnu Love Story. “The film is a modern take on the original love story. I play a villain in the film. But the character will not be seen weilding guns, chasing the heroine or driving rich cars. It is a subtle shade of grey which is manipulative and cunning in a sleek manner.” The film is produced under the banner of Krupa Entertainment and is directed by MGR. Will he be delivering his own dialogues or will someone dub for him? “During the shoot, I said my own dialogues. I did learn a bit of Kannada so I could understand the lines and emote better. But as I am still new to the language, I think it is better that someone dubs for me as my diction is not perfect,” says Ashraf, who adds he is open to any kind of roles. He now looks forward to working in more Kannada films as he “fell in love” with this industry. He dreams of making his mark “in films and people’s heart. I want to be remembered for the characters I portray on screen and not just as Ashraf. Every character I depict on screen should have an impact on my audience,” he adds.|0|
Street smart with art|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|On the first Sunday of January, Kumara Krupa Road turns into an art hub with Chitra Santhe. “The santhe makes art accessible,” says MJ Kamalakshi, General Secretary, Chitrakala Parishath (CKP). Organised by CKP, this year’s santhe is on January 6 and is dedicated to the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. The theme for the 16th edition of Chitra Santhe is Gandhi and Gandhism with paintings and rare photos displayed at CKP. A 10-foot high charkha, a 20-foot model of Gandhi’s glasses in metal and cotton, and Sabarmati Ashram in bamboo by students and staff of CKP will be on display. “People can walk through Gandhiji’s iconic glasses, which will be placed at the Shivananda Store entrance,” says Kamalakshi. The day-long street art festival draws nearly three lakh visitors. Participants are a mix of national awardees, amateurs, professionals, caricaturists and tattooists. “This year we will have nearly 20 states participating,” says Prof. Tejendra Singh Baoni, Principal CKP. “There will be nearly two lakh paintings displayed in 1,600 stalls by nearly 2,000 artists. Stalls will be set up on Kumara Krupa Road and CKP. Extensions at Crescent Road and Gandhi Bhavan Road side roads and open sites are inevitable given the huge demand from 60,000 applicants.” “Participation is 30 % higher than last year,” says Kamalakshi adding “We provide stalls to artists for Rs. 300, with free breakfast and lunch.” Chitrakala Parishath promotes art without taking any commission from artists during the Santhe. The State Government pitches in with funding. “How many artists can afford a gallery, and how many in public can afford to buy art there? Chitra Santhe bridged this gap,” while art pieces reaching a connoisseurs was the much-needed connect,” Kamalakshi said. How it began When CKP founder Nanjunda Rao died in 2003, a new committee was formed with DK Chowta as Secretary and Kamalakhshi as Joint Secretary. “We at CKP thought an event along the lines of European street art once a year would help the public and artists. The thought was turned into reality in January 2004,” says Kamalakshi. Out of the artistes selected for the santhe, 50 % are from Karnataka. “Several professionals and amateurs come in from every district of the State as we have art schools in Hubli, Dharwad, Raichur, Mangaluru, Bidar and Mysuru. As far as other States are concerned, this year, the maximum applications came from Pune, Mumbai, Kolkata, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Pondicherry, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Orissa, Maharashtra, Goa in that order,” says Kamalakhshi. (Profiling initiatives that work to enrich life in the city) And the award goes to And the award goes to  The 2019 Chitrakala Samman Awards dedicated to former Chief Minister, Devaraj Urs, founder-president CKP, Arya Murthy and philanthropist Kejriwal, will be awarded to senior contemporary artists JMS Mani and J Rawal and traditional Mysore painter Neela Panch on January 5 at the CKP|0|
Having a field day|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|There’s a cute little story behind the name Washington Sundar, and it’s one tale that the young cricketer never tires of telling. His father, M Sundar, who was also a passionate cricketer, was helped a great deal by a mentor . “My father looked up to him and considered him a role model. His name was Washington.” So, when M Sundar had a boy a few years after his mentor passed away, he had no second thoughts on the name. Thus was born ‘Washington Sundar’. The all-rounder has been making a big impression in the cricketing arena in the last couple of years. After an impressive outing in the IPL in 2017, when he played for the Dhoni-led Pune team, he has gone on to play for the country, a big achievement for someone who is just 19 years old. “I’ve been consistently improving; that’s something that gives me a lot of confidence.” Hometown tales He attributes a lot of that to the cricket-crazy city of Chennai that he grew up in. “Being street smart is almost inbuilt in the city’s youngsters, probably because of their varied experiences on different fields. I personally didn’t get to play a lot of street cricket, but I did pick up a lot from the many professional cricket matches I played here,” he says, reminiscing about his growing up years. Growing up, Washington admired Brian Lara and Yuvraj Singh, but he has of late become a huge fan of MS Dhoni, under whom he played in the IPL in 2017. “He (Dhoni) has been very encouraging. Even at times when things are not going well for me, he keeps telling me to keep my cool. If you listen to MS Dhoni, half your job is done.” Washington’s rise in cricketing circles has been the stuff of dreams, but he remains grounded. It has helped that his family members share his love for the game — his sister too is a cricket fanatic and has played the game extensively. “She loves cricket more than anything else,” he says. Does he follow women’s cricket as well? “Yes, things have been looking up on that front as well. We are looking at an exclusive IPL for women soon.”   Celluloid beckons   Washington Sundar will soon be featured in Star Sports’ ‘Son of Soil’, a documentary on sporting heroes from Tamil Nadu  The programme, which was launched in December, will also be featuring sports stars like Lakshmanan Govindan (athlete), Ilavazagi (carrom) and Joshna Chinappa (squash), among others  Pitch it up The first ever match of the Ranji Trophy was held in 1934 between Madras and Mysore, at the Chepauk stadium in Chennai.|0|

Himalayan marmot genome offers clues to life at extremely high altitudes|Washington:|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST| Researchers have sequenced the first complete genome of the Himalayan marmot, which may help better explain how the mammals survive at altitudes of up to 5,000 metres. Marmots are found in the Himalayan regions of India, Nepal, and Pakistan and on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau of China, where many of them face extreme cold, little oxygen, and few other resources. The findings hint at the genetic mechanisms underlying high-altitude adaptation and hibernation, said researchers at the Xi’an Jiaotong University in China. They also serve as a valuable resource for researchers studying marmot evolution, highland disease, and cold adaptation. “As one of the highest-altitude-dwelling mammals, the Himalayan marmot is chronically exposed to cold temperature, hypoxia, and intense UV radiation,” said Enqi Liu of Xi’an Jiaotong University Health Science Center. “They also hibernate for more than six months during the wintertime,” Liu said. Those striking biological features led Liu and his team, including Liang Bai, to consider the Himalayan marmot as an ideal animal model for studying the molecular mechanisms of adaptation to extreme environments.

‘The car, for me, was a necessity’|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|My first car was a second-hand Padmini Standard that I bought for Rs. 25,000 in 1985. It was a lot of money for me. The Padmini Standard was one of those small cars which was very popular during that time. However, I never drove the car and still don’t drive one. I was compelled to buy the car to use it for my commute to work. This was the time I was shooting for the popular serialKhandaanfor Doordarshan (DD). Earlier, I would take a bus or train to get to work, but when my popularity as an actress grew, taking public transport to the studio became difficult. Our pay then was Rs. 1,000 per episode, since it was a weekly episode. I made Rs. 4,000 every month fromKhandaan. I pooled all the money I had and went looking for a car. Since I was desperate for one, I wasn’t even looking at any particular colour. My goal was to buy one that fit my budget. Finally, I found a green Padmini Standard and purchased it immediately. I remember being excited to go on the test-drive. I was driven to the place where the Worli Sea Link turn is now. For some reason, that drive is still clear in my memory, and even now, when I take a ride on the Worli Sea Link route, I feel extremely nostalgic. It brings back memories of my young days as an actor. The car, for me, was a necessity. Even though I didn’t get the time or have the means to go out more often, as youngsters these days do, I felt content getting driven to and from home for work. My ultimate luxury and happiness was that I was able to take my own home-cooked food in mydabbas,keep it in the car and eat itbilkul aram se(comfortably). The car remained with me for a long time and the person who drove the car was a very good driver. The car made me comfortable about going for shoots in different locations. It was a sense of independence for me. I didn’t have to wait for anyone to drop me nor did I have to depend on anyone to pick me up for any outing. I sometimes wonder where the car is or whether any part of that car still exists. Mechanically, it must have not have had any problem, because the driver never complained or maybe he was kind enough not to. Even today I don’t drive, I don’t even have a licence. Recently, I bought a Toyota Camry and I am happy with the car. I think I don’t complain much about cars because I don’t drive. As told to Prabalika M Borah  The car also made me comfortable about going for shoots in different locations|0|
Unacceptable, but so very acceptable|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|If I was a builder who built a sub-standard building that collapsed and killed a few people, or if I was an engineer who inspected and certified such a building as safe, I would be arrested. If I was not very rich, I would probably do some jail time too. I think it is also safe to assume that the State would chip in and offer compensation for the deaths. It does so in cases of accidents, fires, or bridges falling. Funny, then, that a city should simply shake off responsibility when its own municipality is directly responsible for the safety and maintenance of the space. The failure to maintain roads can, and does lead to deaths. But somehow, these deaths do not lead to an outcry, or calls for justice and affixing of culpability, the way a building or bridge collapse death would. The Hindureported recently that, between 2013 and 2017, close to 15,000 Indians had died in accidents caused by potholes. Other reports suggest that the government has admitted to over 9,300 deaths and 25,000 people being injured because of potholes over the last three years. Our Supreme Court has described this situation as “unacceptable”. Mumbai, with its nearly five-month monsoon spell, is especially vulnerable to pothole-related damage. In July last year, a young motorcyclist was killed when his bike fell after hitting a pothole. Just days before, two other pothole-related incidents were reported, one involved a pedestrian and another a mother-of-two who was riding pillion on a bike. Recently, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) flatly refused to pay compensation to victims of road accidents, even if these deaths were caused by potholes. A corporator had demanded compensation, in response to which, the BMC said that the roads were the responsibility of the contractors. Getting off scot-free In November, a woman and a six-month-old baby were reported killed when the bike they were riding pillion on skidded on a potholed road in Dadar. The family of four on the bike was thrown off and crushed by an oncoming water tanker. Oddly enough, the police thought it fit to arrest the tanker driver, but not to take any action against those who are responsible for filling potholes on the roads. The BMC has not responded well to criticism of its handling of the pothole situation. When radio jockey Malishka spoofed the ‘Sonu’ song, calling it the ‘Pothole Mix’, changing the lyrics to describe the mess the city is reduced to during the rainy season — potholes, water-logging, traffic and stalling of trains — the Shiv Sena and its corporators responded with outrage, suggesting that she be sued for ‘defaming’ the municipal body. Eventually, the BMC did send a notice to the RJ’s mother, for ‘dengue breeding’ at home. Perhaps, the corporators need to take some lessons from Mumbaikar Dadarao Bilhore. In 2015, his teenage son died in a pothole-related accident. By June 2018, the grieving father had managed to fill up 556 potholes. He did express the hope that the BMC and MMRDA would look at people and be inspired to do a better job. Bilhore has shown that it can be done quickly and efficiently. It is, nevertheless, a great tragedy that heartbroken citizens should have to do a job for which taxpayers are already paying municipalities and their contractors. Perhaps, the courts need to do more than say “unacceptable”. The author is a writer of essays, stories, poems and scripts for stage and screen  The failure to maintain roads can, and does lead to deaths  Ditch the ditch In Bengaluru, a social venture by a group of citizens called ‘Pothole Raja’ has fixed more than 4,500 potholes in the city.|0|

Back to the future|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|"An exhibition marking Ashok Leyland’s 70th anniversary last year featured two restored Austins: an A40 Devon that the company assembled and sold in India; an Austin A40 Somerset, standing amidst symbols of electric-vehicle (EV) technology. The shell of the car was all Somerset, but its soul had been recast with this technology, an exercise that signifed a convergence of the past and the future. Titled ‘Back To The Future’, it describes the place EVs are beginning to reclaim. Yes, reclaim. Let me illustrate . In 2014, Formula E emerged as a new form of motor racing, one driven entirely by EV technology. The championship has the official mark of the Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile and the technology has been improving rapidly over the years. As the 2018-2019 season is underway, we see a Gen 2 electric racing car scorch the tarmac. If you compared the specs of the Gen 1 and Gen 2 race cars, you’ll see the tech spikes. The new Formula E electric race car has more zip, and with a new battery, greater ‘staying power’. Reportedly twice as powerful as the previous one, the battery can now last the entire course of a race. The competition has also been getting fiercer. According to information posted at ABB Formula-E’s official website fiaformulae.com, the sixth season (2019-2020) will get more intense, with one more heavyweight, Mercedes-Benz, joining the fray. Our own Mahindra Racing, the motor racing wing of the Mahindra Group, is one of the teams in the Formula E series. Now, let us rewind to the early 1900s, and zoom in on the race tracks of those days. Any analysis of racing seasons back then will have three sections: automobiles with engines running on gasoline (a North American term for petrol), steam-powered automobiles, and electric automobiles. In an account of a racing season published in its edition dated January 30, 1904,Scientific American, a weekly, treats track records of electric automobiles and those involving gasoline-run automobiles, with an almost equal importance. The listed track records are quite revealing. For example, “the Baker electric torpedo"", which seems to be quite a popular electric racecar of those times, wins the 10-mile race in 17 minutes and 58 seconds. And, in their categories, two cars running on gasoline, are listed as having completed 10 miles in the nine to 10 minutes range. Contrary to what we may assume, EVs continued to be present , if only on the periphery, despite gasoline-run vehicles gaining rapidly in popularity as a result of more refined engines. The impressive success achieved by Detroit Electric illustrates this. Anderson Electric Car Company made an electric car titled Detroit Electric that was in production from 1907 to 1939. Though tortoise-fast, this electric car seemed to impress automobile-loving Americans with how much ground it could cover on a charge. It is said to have scored high on manoeuvrability . One of the Americans sold on the Detroit Electric was Clara Ford, the wife of the man who brought the three ‘A’s together — automobiles, affordability, and the American Dream. Henry Ford’s wife’s attachment to the Detroit Electric car is part of automobile lore. You may read about it at thehenryford.org, and see it at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, where a 1914 Detroit Electric Model 47 Brougham, owned by Clara, is on display. In 2008, the Detroit Electric brand was revived, and eight years later, an electric performance car called Detroit Electric SP.01 was made. And 2018 showed that in certain pockets of the world, especially China and the UK, EV goals are being pursued with great intensity. In October, the Dundee City Council from the United Kingdom received the title ‘Europe’s most visionary electric vehicle city’ from the World Electric Vehicle Association, for ensuring that two-fifth of its fleet consists of EVs and for creating an ecosystem encouraging people to opt for them. Another sign that we are accelerating towards this future is Lamborghini taking the wraps off the Terzo Millennio, an electric concept car produced in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  A charged past In 1901, Thomas Edison made a Nickel-Iron battery for Electric Vehicles."|0|

His regular posts about the benefits of cycling, popular cycling routes, what bicycles to buy and profiles of interesting cyclists in the city impressed BYCS. Efforts as Bicycle Mayor “I am working towards changing perceptions of people towards the cycle, which is essentially seen as the poor man’s transport. Also, there are concerns like lack of dedicated lanes and PBS, but I feel unless and until more people take up cycling, these issues won’t be addressed, so I am pushing for as many people as possible to take up cycling,” says Arshel. Arshel is visiting schools, colleges in Guwahati, to promote cycling and feels ever since he became the bicycle mayor, his reach has expanded. “People have become approachable. The government officials give me a patient hearing,” states Arshel, who is also part of Guwahati Cycling Community, which is reportedly the largest cycling group in the Northeast. Arshel also conducts sporting events for cyclists through Wheelion, another outfit formed by him. The road ahead He wants to work towards promoting cycling among children and encourage people living closer to their workplaces to use a bicycle. There are approximately 1,000 hobby cyclists in Guwahati today, but no bike lanes.|0|

Pushing for a smooth ride|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The concept of bicycle mayors was unknown to many of us until we had four appointed for the two-year honorary position in Vadodara, Valsad, Guwahati, and Bengaluru in quick successions in 2017-18. Over these two years, Nikita Lalwani in Vadodara, Bhairavi Joshi in Valsad, Arshel Akhter in Guwahati, and Sathya Sankaran in Bengaluru have been actively engaging with citizens and the Governments of their cities through sustained campaigns and events, to promote the cause of cycling. Bicycle mayor is a programme run by BYCS, an Amsterdam-based NGO, which is pursuing its goal of 50/30. The idea is to get people in all the cities in the world to make half of their trips by bikes and thus preserve the earth. As of now, there are 15 bicycle mayors across the world, the youngest of whom is Lotta Crok, an 8-year-old from Amsterdam. We speak to three bicycle mayors from India to find out the progress made so far and the road ahead.|0|

‘I killed my youth working’|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Harris Jayaraj’s Studio H at Valasaravakkam, Chennai, is an impressive structure with plenty of open spaces inside. There are a few office rooms, which lead you to a garden and swimming pool. Harris’ residence is right behind — he can quickly saunter over if a tune needs fixing. The composer had a quiet 2018, but he had a good end to the year, with the release ofDev’s (starring Karthi, the film will also release in Telugu) album. In an interview, he chats about the film’s songs, staying relevant and why his songs tend to sound similar. Excerpts: You’ve mentioned earlier how your relationship with directors is important. WhenDev’s director Rajath Ravishankar came to you, what struck you about him and the subject? I liked the story and thought that I could justify it musically. I firmly believe that the director is the captain of the ship... he is responsible for everything! (laughs) Rajath had a certain vision and he could envision the film in his head. The producer (Lakshman Kumar) was also passionate about it. I see the director and producer as husband and wife. We are their kids! Would you callDeva return to the brand of music Harris is known for? I don’t know if I would describe it as a ‘brand of music’, but composing for young films has always been my favourite. I love to write music for young subjects. We can work from our heart, have fun with the score, and do not need to follow ‘Kodambakkam rules’ while doing so. I come from that school of music — all my songs in the films of Gautham Menon and Jeeva have been like that. Unfortunately, I haven’t seen a genuine young film for the past 10 years.  But you didNanban (Snehitudu in Telugu)... But that’s for a Superstar. It was the character of a young chap played by a superstar. This meant that we had to fulfil fans’ expectations. But if you listen toUllam Ketkumae,12Bor evenDev, you’ll know how we are not forced to come up with even one track for the hero, which was not part of the storyline. You’ve worked on many superhit songs for Suriya, but this is your first film with his brother, Karthi... Whenever I met Karthi, he kept telling me that he wanted to be in a film that had my music. But it just didn’t fall in place till now. Karthi was doing a lot of local, rowdy-ish roles back then, and kept saying that he needed to look really good if he were to do a film that had my songs. Thankfully,Devhas brought us together. Is it fair to say that you have been concentrating on quality rather than quantity in the last couple of years? I’ve been doing that for the past 18 years, ever since I started composing for films. I hardly work on more than three films a year. In fact, in 2009, I had only one release (Orange). The reason for that is simple: when I got launched as a composer withMinnale, I was tired... because I had already worked as a musician for more than 600 films, in several languages. When I was a keyboard player, I used to finish a film within a couple of days. When you rush things, you forget ‘quality’ and concentrate on how many projects you took up. I believe that I killed my youth working. So when I débuted as composer, I told myself that I’d concentrate only on quality. A film can fail at the box office, but music won’t. You created a fresh soundscape withMinnale (Cheli). How did you bypass ‘Kodambakkam rules’ of the time? I was lucky to have the support and vision of a director like Gautham Menon, and producer Murali Manohar. The success ofMinnale’s soundtrack proved that audiences liked to hear something different, something that didn’t go with the usual ‘Kodambakkam music grammar’ of the time. That gave way to albums like12BandUnnale Unnale.I’m also fortunate that senior directors like Murugadoss and Shankar accepted my style of music.  A common criticism for your songs is that they tend to sound similar. See, that’s my signature. If someone hears a song of mine and immediately says that it is a Harris number, it means that I’ve succeeded. Every composer has a signature — you can play any track of Hans Zimmer to me, and I’ll know it’s his work without you telling me. Are there occasions when you have worked on a single number for a long time? If you are overdoing a song, it means that there is something basically wrong with the tune. Just because you work on a tune for 100 days doesn’t mean that it will become a superhit. Magic happens within a single recording session. Many Tamil stand-up comedians taking friendly jibes at your music. Are you aware of these? Yes, I have watched those videos. It’s their way of putting things together. I appreciate their talent, but not the intention.  Karthi kept telling me that he needed to look really good if he were to do a film that had my songs. Thankfully,Devbrought us together|0|
Sathya Sankaran|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Bicycle Mayor, Bengaluru, 2018 An activist and passionate cyclist, Sathya has been working towards the cause of promoting cycles in Bengaluru, for quite some time. During his 40-km commute to work, he realised how badly Bengaluru roads need to be de-congested.  Efforts as Bicycle Mayor The latest one was a challenge thrown by him to Bengalureans to cycle to work. Companies or a group of employees could register on cycleto.work and well, cycle to work. The teams clocking the highest number of hours and km will be rewarded at the end of the challenge. The idea is not just to encourage people to cycle, but also to track the number of cyclists in the city, popular routes taken by them and present this data to the authorities concerned and press them to invest in bicycle infrastructure in the city. He has also been pressing for carriageways to be maintained by the authorities for cyclists to have a smooth ride. Sathya prepared a detailed policy plan/proposal detailing such issues and submitted it to the relevant department. Sathya is also associated with the Bike School, Council for Change and Cycle Day events held across Bengaluru. The United Nations General Assembly declared June 3 as World Bicycle Day and Sathya led a 10-km ride with 100 cyclists in the city. “I must add thatThe Hinduhas played a big role in Cycle Days celebrated in different locations in the city.”  The road ahead “The most important objective is to get motorists to respect and not harass cyclists and walkers in 2019. We are working on visual aids, social media material, and screenings to get the message across. We are in the process of designing stickers emblazoned with ‘I respect cyclists’ and putting it on auto rickshaws. As they spread this message, they themselves will become aware of their actions. It is common for motorists to threaten and harass cyclists in Bengaluru and I also experienced an incident where I was almost killed,” says Sathya, who has also co-founded two NGOs Citizens for Sustainability and Praja RAAG. BBMP is supposed to construct 72 km of new cycle tracks, but the plan is stuck due to lack of funds. However, there are a few cycle tracks in place. Public bike sharing isthriving with app-based dockless Yulu Bikes and Mobycy, though Pedl has temporarily stopped its service to work on the quality of its bikes. Directorate of Urban Land Transport was also supposed to launch Namma Trin-Trin bicycles at 40 metro stations in October this year.“I have no idea about it but we need more operators urgently. There are 4,000 bikes available but the demand is for 20,000 bikes,” says Sathya.|0|
Raising the bar|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Sports development is not the task of sports associations and the government alone. A large share of the responsibility also rests with sports enthusiasts and corporate sponsors. While it might be relatively easy for corporates to get involved in sponsoring sports, it is indeed an onerous challenge for individual promoters and it needs passion and dedication. Very few of them have shown those qualities and among that rare bunch is Adinath Narde. A lawyer by profession and an avid tennis enthusiast, Narde has now built a state-of-the-art tennis complex in Jakkur in North Bengaluru, which he hopes will emerge as a major hub for the game in the country. The centre, called the ANT Academy, was inaugurated on December 15. Built at a cost nearing Rs. 1 crore, the centre, spread over one-and-a-half acres, offers aspiring players all facilities under one roof. It boasts seven clay courts, a gymnasium, a swimming pool, change rooms, a sports shop, a cafeteria and additional space for training in other sports such as basketball and volleyball. There is also a spectators’ gallery, which can accommodate 300 persons. The ANT Academy also has in-house experts to train players. A USPTR certified coach, Emmanuel John, is the head coach of the Academy. He is assisted by six other qualified trainers. The Academy has also roped in a diet and nutrition expert, a sports psychologist, a fitness trainer and a yoga teacher. “It is no use if we depend only on the government, associations or other agencies,” says Narde. “We too should do something ourselves and that is why I built this facility. Instead of going to Europe or the US for training, which would cost them heavily, the players could train here with facilities that are on par with anything available abroad.” The regime for players is intensive. They begin the day with yoga at 6.30 am and are then put through fitness drills followed by breakfast, match-play and practice. As of now, the Academy has 15 players in the elite group and 50 in the general category. The ANT Academy plans to have a packed calendar in 2019. “We wish to conduct major junior events in all age-groups every month. We also wish to host a $ 25,000 tournament and I am sure we can even take up the National championship, if given permission. Ultimately, I plan to have an ANT Open with top stars from the tennis world,” says Narde, of his blueprint for the future. To provide youngsters high-level exposure, the Academy plans to select a junior team and send it to Europe for tournaments in due course. The ANT complex has come in for praise from State players and the KSLTA. “Our motto is ‘Believe to Achieve’. If players take that to heart and give their best, they could go far in the game and ANT will provide them a platform to realize their goals,” concludes Narde.|0|
Hormazd Sorabjee,|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The first time Ihad an accident It was on the 1986 Himalayan Rally. My co-driver Jangoo Nicholson and I took part in a Maruti Gypsy. We were the ‘youngest and the oldest’ team, as I was then 22 years old and he was 72! Jangoo (who footed the bill for the entire event) would take the ceremonial flag off everyday and would give me the wheel in the competitive sections. I was pushing hard — a bit too hard on one of the night stages near Almora — and flipped the Gypsy, which ended up upside down against the mountain side (and thankfully not in the valley below). Jangoo was sleeping and he woke up with a shock, hanging upside down like a bat! Our roll cage and four-point safety harness had done its job and luckily the only thing bruised was my ego.

Yogendra Pratap,|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The first time Idrove a vintage car My friend once bought a car for €100, from the widow of its first owner, for whom it was his most prized possession. The car was about the same vintage as I am, and of course I wanted to drive it. So without giving it a second thought, we decided to do an inter-continental drive with it to the capital of Georgia, Tbilisi, and while at it, we also decided to set a non-stop driving record with it! The car was a VAZ-2101 Zhiguli, known behind the iron curtain as the Kopeyka. So in the autumn of 2012, we set out right after the Paris Motor Show. The car was old but it came with its own workshop neatly laid out in its boot, the problem being that we knew nothing about fixing a Zhiguli. Luckily our route took us through eastern Europe, where everyone’s father had owned one and knew how to repair it. When the car broke down, it was quickly repaired, and depending on where it broke down, we had experts working on the car in minutes. When it broke down outside a school in Slovakia, we had the headmaster fixing it; when it broke down in front of a fire station in Bulgaria, we had a fire-engine-load of firemen repairing it; and when it broke down on the Turkish-border, we pushed it down the slope into Georgia, where the immigration officer at the border check-post wanted to leave his cubicle to get the car started again. We did set the record for non-stop driving from Vilnius to Tbilisi, and we did it in a nearly half-a-century-old Lada. Editor,Auto Today|0|

Aspi Bhathena,|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The first time Iwon a medal for something meaningful The Isle of Man TT (IOM TT) races are among the oldest running motor races and also the most prestigious in the world. In 1986, I was racing at the Oulton Park motor raceway, UK. Bill Smith spotted me while I was riding and asked if I would like to race in the IOM TT. One year later, in 1987, I was on the ferry from Heysham to the Isle of Man for the greatest challenge of my life. The race is held on public roads around the Isle. Each lap consists of 59.7km and the race comprises four laps (238.9 km). It is the most demanding, challenging, and dangerous race in the world. You are travelling between stone walls and lamp-posts at more than 250 km/h. I happen to be the only Indian to have completed the race and won a bronze medal. I have won a number of races, but finishing the TT was more satisfying than winning any race.  Editor,Car India;Bike India|0|
Rishad Saam Mehta,|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The first time Ifell in love with a bike When I was 21 years old/ Typically rash, stupid and bold,/ I went through a phase called the double ‘A’/ My automotive adolescence so to say. As a compromise between power and money/ I was given the Rajdoot Yamaha 350/ Yes, the one with the miserable fuel economy. Though the four-figure petrol bills,/ Gave my wallet nasty chills,/ The machine gave me amazing thrills. The bike was built for mad, suicidal speed,/ And that was my strongest need./Under me, my Rajdoot Yamaha,/ And the road was my virtual Suzuka. You feel an incomparable high,/ When on the road in harmony, you fly,/ The bike’s an extension of your body, you two are one,/ You think about changing a gear and it’s done./Roaring into a corner you come,/ The wind in your ears a loud hum. Physics says you have to fall, and gravity does try,/ But you make poor old Newton sigh,/ He rolls over and over in his grave,/ Wondering why, according to his laws you don’t behave. Your confidence soars,/ Louder the bike roars,/ The throttle is like a baton in your hand,/ The pistons and the crank, the best orchestra in the land./And it is Wagner’sValkyriesto your mind,/ The sound of the engine screaming toward the red line. The adrenaline and dopamine in your blood make it boil,/ But, on the next corner there’s spilt diesel oil;/ Then comes the fall,/ With a shower of sparks, bike, you and all. You hit the tar at a hundred and one,/ Dragged along with the bike, remember you two are one,/ But now it isn’t so much fun./ You have burns due to friction,/ And pain has reached a new dimension./ You are laid up in bed for quite a while/ And now it is old Newton’s turn to smile.

From farm to app|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|There is plenty the tap of a phone screen can do for you, in this day and age. From information to idle gossip, masseuses to exterminators, birdhouses to living, breathing plants... everyone and everything can reach a household with minimal effort from the end customer. Freshly culled chicken has also been added to the list. Royal Chicken is a brand that plans to take the hassle out of the family ritual of buying fresh chicken. The door-to-door chicken delivery service is starting out ambitious — with its combination of physical outlets, website and Android and iOS apps — yet cautious. With four branches — in Anna Nagar, Virugambakkam, Porur and Siruseri — functional in the city within a month of its November launch, the outfit’s initial strength still lies in its physical stores, with customers walking in to check the produce before they buy them. According to CEO K Ravindran, there are two reasons why the outlets are key to Royal Chicken’s operations, despite its end goal lying in delivery. Firstly, “it builds trust. We can’t expect customers to buy a product like this without having seen it for themselves, and seen the surroundings that they will be buying it from.” It seems to be an effective idea: a clear glass wall divides the air duct-fitted culling area from the air-conditioned billing counter and entrance hall, where customers wait to pick up their orders, readied and weighed before their eyes. The other reason, explains Ravindran, is ease of delivery. Each outlet operates as a satellite with a five-kilometre radius within which meat can be delivered. A coordinator and a delivery person is assigned to each shop. Orders are received from the head office in T Nagar, produce is picked up from the closest shop, and delivered regardless of the lateness of the hour — it is a 24/7 service, after all. Such is the early success of the outfit, that some branches have to employ extra deliverymen on Sundays to deal with the load. “We have our own parent farm, in a village near Dharapuram. The town is close to Coimbatore and there are several breeding farms in the region owing to the favourable climate. We have our own hatchery, where we can ensure quality chicks that are healthy, agile, strong and meet the basic weight requirement of 40 grams for a newly hatched,” he states. The next stage, which is a broiler farm, is also owned by the firm, adds Ravindran, stressing on how the entire operation, from farm to retail outlet, is managed by the company itself “so we have a control on quality, with no chance of adulteration”.|0|
Tales of struggle and pride|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The archway to the entrance of St Ebbas Girls Higher Secondary School, Mylapore, bears the names of greats such as BR Ambedkar, Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King Jr and Bhagat Singh. It’s the first thing one sees of Vaanam Arts Festival a three-day cultural initiative curated by Pa Ranjith. The festival was conceived and nurtured with an idea to highlight the social contradictions that plague society — caste discrimination, gender bias and other issues — via theatre, music and dance. A few steps into the ground, a giant structure made of recycled cardboard — resembling BR Ambedkar to the T — is hoisted. People mill about it, clicking selfies, as rhythmic beats of drums — being happily pounded upon by grinning children and adults — provide a background score. A few paces ahead, numerous paintings lie scattered through the grounds. Pencil sketches, colourful oils, watercolours. Artists — some self-taught, others educated in the Fine Arts — gather under the sky to parade their talent. A few enterprising souls sketch the faces of willing participants. Statues of unsung Dalit heroes and heroines abound, sculpted by the alumni of various Government Fine Arts colleges in Tamil Nadu, and led by G Chandrasekaran, principal, Government College of Fine Arts, Chennai. Larger issues With the plastic ban coming into force, a massive elephant almost six feet in height made of plastic, stands alone. Children loiter near it, and try to lift its trunk. A few steps away stands a giant cardboard art structure, resembling a temple entrance. Look closely and you’ll notice a child standing, hand out-stretched... you can almost hear the plea! The piece drives home the point about temple entry restrictions, an issue we still experience. Another artwork rests against a tree, separate and alone. It has children’s clothes pinned to the board, but the clothes and the board are decorated with red hand prints which says everything about the state of children’s rights and the violence they undergo. A few paces away, a huge wall dominates the space — it is replete with paintings and posters about issues we currently face. Stark black-and-white photographs vie for attention, along with quirky but hard-hitting cartoons, about the #MeToo movement, Kashmir, women rights... To the left of this wall are water colour portraits of Karl Marx, Ambedkar, Periyar, with the slogan ‘Educate, Agitate, Organise’. It does not dominate the space like other works, but the message is hard to ignore. A podium at the heart of the ground bears the bust of 26 unsung heroes and heroines of various Dalit struggles. It is displayed in a semi-circle and invites people to read, linger and take photos. Those featured include Tirunelveli Ponnusamy, who fought for temple entry; Vanjinagaram Kandan, who worked for the right of Dalit people to access water; Veerammal, belonging to Tiruchi, who constructed a school for Dalit girls; and Pandian who sought the right to refuse to play theparai(drum) when demanded by dominant castes. While 25 of them were native to Tamil Nadu, a foreigner also made it to the list — James HA Tremenheere. Tremenheere was the Chinglepet Collector in the 1890s. He had assigned 12 lakh acres to the oppressed classes of the Madras Presidency. Beyond art The festival didn’t showcase artwork alone: for the book lovers, there were also stalls featuring books from Tamil and English literature. Topics ranged from capitalism to women’s rights and, the histories of various greats who protested biases and discrimination. The evenings were dedicated to dance shows, theatre,paraiperformances, poetry readings, workshops on public speaking for young adults andbommalattam(puppetry) for children. It also served as a platform for aspiring musicians. A collection of selected short stories and poetry will be published by Neelam Cultural Centre at a later date.|0|

36 not out|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The turn of the year has, expectedly, brought in a bunch of announcements from the Telugu film industry. The first look poster of Nani from the sports dramaJersey, directed by Gautam Tinnanuri, has a vintage vibe to it. Nani plays the character of Arjun, a 36-year-old cricketer for whom there’s nothing left to prove. He’s had his share of dream innings and heartburns. The 1996-77 Ranji Trophy season, according to the makers, was just a display of his love for batting. That’s an interesting premise, isn’t it? We’ll have to wait till April to see how the makers discuss issues concerning a cricketer in his mid-30s. Jersey introduces the talented Shraddha Srinath to Telugu cinema, who will star alongside Sathyaraj, Brahmaji and Ronit Kamra. Music by Anirudh Ravichander.|0|
The first time I…|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The first time Iwitnessed how car-crazy Italians really are I’ve heard about car-mad Italians heading to Fiorano just to be able to stand outside Ferrari’s test track and watch through the cracks on the walls while the supercar maker’s drivers tested their latest cars. But to witness first-hand how passionate they are was a different experience altogether. I was in Maranello, Italy, to test-drive the 458 Italia; it was just a few days since the convertible had been launched. Getting on to the highway near Ferrari’s wind tunnel facility was easy in the morning and I was taking the opportunity to drive top-down despite the nip in the air. Surprisingly, I kept hearing a lot of honking, something that is very rare on European roads. It was only after a truck driver from two lanes away honked and waved to me that I realised that they were all appreciating the car. All through the day while I drove, other cars would pull close and passengers would stick their heads out to shout ‘Bellissimo’ (handsome; alas not me!). At the lunch and coffee stops, random people came up to see the car and strike up a conversation, including a few cops. Heading back to the hotel in the evening, I was accosted by a couple of drivers in Lamborghinis who sandwiched me in between and wanted me to race them. That one sweeping, windy stretch of the highway was reverberating with the angry exhaust notes of three super cars.  Consulting Motoring Editor,The Hindu BusinessLine|0|

Rishad Saam Mehta,|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The first time Ifell in love with a bike When I was 21 years old/ Typically rash, stupid and bold,/ I went through a phase called the double ‘A’/ My automotive adolescence so to say. As a compromise between power and money/ I was given the Rajdoot Yamaha 350/ Yes, the one with the miserable fuel economy. Though the four-figure petrol bills,/ Gave my wallet nasty chills,/ The machine gave me amazing thrills. The bike was built for mad, suicidal speed,/ And that was my strongest need./Under me, my Rajdoot Yamaha,/ And the road was my virtual Suzuka. You feel an incomparable high,/ When on the road in harmony, you fly,/ The bike’s an extension of your body, you two are one,/ You think about changing a gear and it’s done./Roaring into a corner you come,/ The wind in your ears a loud hum. Physics says you have to fall, and gravity does try,/ But you make poor old Newton sigh,/ He rolls over and over in his grave,/ Wondering why, according to his laws you don’t behave. Your confidence soars,/ Louder the bike roars,/ The throttle is like a baton in your hand,/ The pistons and the crank, the best orchestra in the land./And it is Wagner’sValkyriesto your mind,/ The sound of the engine screaming toward the red line. The adrenaline and dopamine in your blood make it boil,/ But, on the next corner there’s spilt diesel oil;/ Then comes the fall,/ With a shower of sparks, bike, you and all. You hit the tar at a hundred and one,/ Dragged along with the bike, remember you two are one,/ But now it isn’t so much fun./ You have burns due to friction,/ And pain has reached a new dimension./ You are laid up in bed for quite a while/ And now it is old Newton’s turn to smile.

Having a field day|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|There’s a cute story behind the name Washington Sundar, and it’s one that the young cricketer never tires of telling. His father, M Sundar, who was also a passionate cricketer, was helped a lot by a mentor. “My father looked up to him and considered him a role model. His name was Washington.” And so, when M Sundar had a baby boy a few years after his mentor passed away, he had no second thoughts on the name. And thus was born ‘Washington Sundar’. The all-rounder has been making an impression in the cricketing arena over the last couple of years. After an impressive outing in the IPL in 2017, when he played for the Dhoni-led Pune team, he has gone on to play for the country, a huge achievement for someone who is just 19. “I’ve been consistently improving; that’s something that gives me a lot of confidence.” Hometown tale He attributes a lot of that to the cricket-crazy city of Chennai that he grew up in. “Being streetsmart is almost inbuilt in the city’s youngsters, probably because of their varied experiences on different fields. I personally didn’t get to play a lot of street cricket, but I did pick up a lot from the many professional cricket matches I played here,” he says, reminiscing about his growing-up years. That was the time when he wanted to spend all day in the cricket field. “I loved the game. I never wanted to rest. After I finished my batting session, I’d be raring and ready to bowl or field,” he says. It was this passion that helped Washington climb the ladders of cricket to get to the big league. The IPL was also a big factor in getting him noticed. “When you look back, it has already been more than a decade of IPL. So many players who have played for the league have gone on to play for the country. The league has honestly changed the lives of many cricketers, including me. I got to play for India because of that,” he stresses. Mentor matters Growing up, Washington admired Brian Lara and Yuvraj Singh, but he has of late become a huge fan of MS Dhoni, under whom he played in IPL in 2017. “He (Dhoni) has been very encouraging. Even at times when things are not going well for me, he keeps telling me to keep my cool. If you listen to Dhoni, half your job is done.” Washington’s rise in cricketing circles has been the stuff of dreams, but he remains grounded. It has helped that his family shares his love for the game — his sister too is a cricket fanatic and has played the game extensively. “She loves cricket more than anything else,” he says. Does he follow women’s cricket? “Yes, things have been looking up on that front as well. We are looking at an exclusive IPL for women soon.” Women’s cricket has also been showcased on the big screen recently — the Tamil filmKanaahad a girl wanting to play for India. “I’m a huge fan of Tamil films.Oru padam kuda vida maten(I won’t miss watching even a single one). Movies likeKanaaare very inspiring for women to take up a sport and move up in life,” says the cricketer, whose favourite actor is Vijay Sethupathi.  Celluloid beckons   Washington Sundar will soon be featured in Star Sports’ ‘Son of Soil’, a documentary on sporting heroes from Tamil Nadu  The programme, which was launched in December, will also be featuring sports stars like Lakshmanan Govindan (athlete), Ilavazhagi (carrom) and Joshna Chinappa (squash), among others  Pitch it up The first ever match of the Ranji Trophy was held in 1934 between Madras and Mysore, at the Chepauk stadium in Chennai.|0|
Pushing for a smooth ride|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The concept of bicycle mayors was unknown to many of us until we had four appointed for the two-year honorary position in Vadodara, Valsad, Guwahati, and Bengaluru in quick successions in 2017-18. Over these two years, Nikita Lalwani in Vadodara, Bhairavi Joshi in Valsad, Arshel Akhter in Guwahati, and Sathya Sankaran in Bengaluru have been actively engaging with citizens and the Governments of their cities through sustained campaigns and events, to promote the cause of cycling. Bicycle mayor is a programme run by BYCS, an Amsterdam-based NGO, which is pursuing its goal of 50/30. The idea is to get people in all the cities in the world to make half of their trips by bikes and thus preserve the earth. As of now, there are 15 bicycle mayors across the world, the youngest of whom is Lotta Crok, an 8-year-old from Amsterdam. We speak to three bicycle mayors from India to find out the progress made so far and the road ahead.|0|
Arshel Akhter|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Bicycle Mayor, Guwahati, 2018 Arshel is an investor who was inspired by his friends and people who cycled. He bought a mountain bike and began exploring areas nearby. As Arshel followed the circuit closely, especially various cycling groups on social media, he felt motivated to take it up intensely and launched ‘Pedal for a change’ on Facebook. His regular posts about the benefits of cycling, popular cycling routes, what bicycles to buy and profiles of interesting cyclists in the city impressed BYCS. Efforts as Bicycle Mayor “I am working towards changing perceptions of people towards the cycle, which is essentially seen as the poor man’s transport. Also, there are concerns like lack of dedicated lanes and PBS, but I feel unless and until more people take up cycling, these issues won’t be addressed, so I am pushing for as many people as possible to take up cycling,” says Arshel. Arshel is visiting schools, colleges in Guwahati, to promote cycling and feels ever since he became the bicycle mayor, his reach has expanded. “People have become approachable. The government officials give me a patient hearing,” states Arshel, who is also part of Guwahati Cycling Community, which is reportedly the largest cycling group in the Northeast. Arshel also conducts sporting events for cyclists through Wheelion, another outfit formed by him. The road ahead He wants to work towards promoting cycling among children and encourage people living closer to their workplaces to use a bicycle. There are approximately 1,000 hobby cyclists in Guwahati today, but no bike lanes.|0|

Back to the future|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|"An exhibition marking Ashok Leyland’s 70th anniversary last year featured two restored Austins: an A40 Devon that the company assembled and sold in India; an Austin A40 Somerset, standing amidst symbols of electric-vehicle (EV) technology. The shell of the car was all Somerset, but its soul had been recast with this technology, an exercise that signifed a convergence of the past and the future. Titled ‘Back To The Future’, it describes the place EVs are beginning to reclaim. Yes, reclaim. Let me illustrate. In 2014, Formula E emerged as a new form of motor racing, one driven entirely by EV technology. The championship has the official mark of the Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile and the technology has been improving rapidly over the years. As the 2018-2019 season is underway, we see a Gen 2 electric racing car scorch the tarmac. If you compared the specs of the Gen 1 and Gen 2 race cars, you’ll see the tech spikes. The new Formula E electric race car has more zip, and with a new battery, greater ‘staying power’. Reportedly twice as powerful as the previous one, the battery can now last the entire course of a race. The competition has also been getting fiercer. According to information posted at ABB Formula-E’s official website fiaformulae.com, the sixth season (2019-2020) will get more intense, with one more heavyweight, Mercedes-Benz, joining the fray. Our own Mahindra Racing, the motor racing wing of the Mahindra Group, is one of the teams in the Formula E series. Now, let us rewind to the early 1900s, and zoom in on the race tracks of those days. Any analysis of racing seasons back then will have three sections: automobiles with engines running on gasoline (a North American term for petrol), steam-powered automobiles, and electric automobiles. In an account of a racing season published in its edition dated January 30, 1904,Scientific American, a weekly, treats track records of electric automobiles and those involving gasoline-run automobiles, with an almost equal importance. The listed track records are quite revealing. For example, “the Baker electric torpedo"", which seems to be quite a popular electric racecar of those times, wins the 10-mile race in 17 minutes and 58 seconds. And, in their categories, two cars running on gasoline, are listed as having completed 10 miles in the nine to 10 minutes range. Contrary to what we may assume, EVs continued to be present, if only on the periphery, despite gasoline-run vehicles gaining rapidly in popularity as a result of more refined engines. The impressive success achieved by Detroit Electric illustrates this. Anderson Electric Car Company made an electric car titled Detroit Electric that was in production from 1907 to 1939. Though tortoise-fast, this electric car seemed to impress automobile-loving Americans with how much ground it could cover on a charge. It is said to have scored high on manoeuvrability . One of the Americans sold on the Detroit Electric was Clara Ford, the wife of the man who brought the three ‘A’s together — automobiles, affordability, and the American Dream. Henry Ford’s wife’s attachment to the Detroit Electric car is part of automobile lore. You may read about it at thehenryford.org, and see it at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, where a 1914 Detroit Electric Model 47 Brougham, owned by Clara, is on display. In 2008, the Detroit Electric brand was revived, and eight years later, an electric performance car called Detroit Electric SP.01 was made. And 2018 showed that in certain pockets of the world, especially China and the UK, EV goals are being pursued with great intensity. In October, the Dundee City Council from the United Kingdom received the title ‘Europe’s most visionary electric vehicle city’ from the World Electric Vehicle Association, for ensuring that two-fifth of its fleet consists of EVs and for creating an ecosystem encouraging people to opt for them. Another sign that we are accelerating towards this future is Lamborghini taking the wraps off the Terzo Millennio, an electric concept car produced in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  A charged past In 1901, Thomas Edison made a Nickel-Iron battery for Electric Vehicles."|0|
‘The car, for me, was a necessity’|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|My first car was a second-hand Padmini Standard that I bought for Rs. 25,000 in 1985. It was a lot of money for me. The Padmini Standard was one of those small cars which was very popular during that time. However, I never drove the car and still don’t drive one. I was compelled to buy the car to use it for my commute to work. This was the time I was shooting for the popular serialKhandaanfor Doordarshan (DD). Earlier, I would take a bus or train to work, but when my popularity as an actress grew, taking public transport became difficult. Our pay then was Rs. 1,000 per episode, since it was a weekly episode. I made Rs. 4,000 every month fromKhandaan. I pooled all my money and went looking for a car. Since I was desperate for one, I wasn’t even looking at a particular colour. My goal was to buy one that fit my budget. I found a green Padmini Standard and purchased it immediately. I remember being excited to go on the test-drive. I was driven to the place where the Worli Sea Link turn is now. For some reason, that drive is still clear in my memory, and even now, when I take a ride on the Worli Sea Link route, I feel extremely nostalgic. It brings back memories of my young days as an actor. The car, for me, was a necessity. Even though I didn’t get the time or have the means to go out more often, as youngsters these days do, I felt content getting driven to and from home for work. My ultimate luxury and happiness was that I was able to take my own home-cooked food in mydabbas,keep it in the car and eat itbilkul aram se(comfortably).  The car made me comfortable about going for shoots in different locations. It was a sense of independence for me. I didn’t have to wait for anyone to drop me nor did I have to depend on anyone to pick me up for any outing. I sometimes wonder where the car is or whether any part of that car still exists. Mechanically, it must have not have had problem, because the driver never complained or maybe he was kind enough not to. Even today I don’t drive, I don’t even have a licence. Recently, I bought a Toyota Camry and I am happy with it. I don’t complain much about cars because I don’t drive. As told to Prabalika M Borah  The car also made me comfortable about going for shoots in different locations|0|
Hormazd Sorabjee,|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The first time Ihad an accident Itwas on the 1986 Himalayan Rally. My co-driver Jangoo Nicholson and I took part in a Maruti Gypsy. We were the ‘youngest and the oldest’ team, as I was then 22 years old and he was 72! Jangoo (who footed the bill for the entire event) would take the ceremonial flag off everyday and would give me the wheel in the competitive sections. I was pushing hard — a bit too hard on one of the night stages near Almora — and flipped the Gypsy, which ended up upside down against the mountain side (and thankfully not in the valley below). Jangoo was sleeping and he woke up with a shock, hanging upside down like a bat! Our roll cage and four-point safety harness had done its job and luckily the only thing bruised was my ego.

Aspi Bhathena,|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The first time Iwon a medal for something meaningful The Isle of Man TT (IOM TT) races are among the oldest running motor races and also the most prestigious in the world. In 1986, I was racing at the Oulton Park motor raceway, UK. Bill Smith spotted me while I was riding and asked if I would like to race in the IOM TT. One year later, in 1987, I was on the ferry from Heysham to the Isle of Man for the greatest challenge of my life. The race is held on public roads around the Isle. Each lap consists of 59.7 kilometre and the race comprises four laps (238.9 kilometre). It is the most demanding, challenging, and dangerous race in the world. You are travelling between stone walls and lamp-posts at more than 250 km/h. I happen to be the only Indian to have completed the race and won a bronze medal. I have won a number of races, but finishing the TT was more satisfying than winning any race.  Editor,Car India;Bike India|0|

Tina, a character in the film battling a life-threatening condition, was essayed by debutante Devika Sanjay. The 16-year-old is ecstatic about the film’s success and her new-found celebrity status. “I am living my dream. I can’t believe that I have fulfilled my wish so early,” says the actor over phone from Koyilandy. It was through her teacher Renuka Sasi that Devika landed the role. The shoot was a joy ride. “I couldn’t attend school for one month, but I made up for it on the sets of the film in Kochi. I am outgoing by nature and so got along well with everyone. Sathyan sir was extremely friendly and understanding. Before my shoot began, Sathyan sir made me watch how a film was shot. So I watched combination scenes of Shanukka [Fahadh Faasil] and Anju chechi [Anju Kurian]. By the time I did my scenes, I was familiar with the process,” she says.  Devika can’t stop raving about Fahadh. “It is a delight watching him perform, especially how he creates magic with those minute expressions, especially the scene where he narrates a story to me.” A huge fan of Nazriya Nazim, Dulquer Salmaan and “now Fahadh”, she had her fan girl moment when Nazriya came on the sets. “I felt like I was in a dream.

Swipe right for more|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|There’s a popular quote in the television seriesGame of Throneswhich goes, “Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armour, and it can never be used to hurt you.” This rings true in the case of Rajasekar Sundaresan, CEO and Founder of Pixalive, a social network application made in India. He decided to wear his social status as an armour after being constantly denied opportunities. Hailing from a family of farmers in Krishnagiri, Rajasekar was passionate about engineering, but wasn’t financially ready. There was a ray of hope when he met Dr APJ Abdul Kalam at MIT, asking for financial support. In a way, the seed for his dreams was sown by Kalam. Armed with a degree in Electronic Engineering,Rajasekar was doing good for himself as a network engineer in Wipro. He was planning to leave for Canada along with his fiancée. All was well, until the bride’s parents discreetly married their daughter to a wealthy groom. It was the same month when the Snapchat CEO made a controversial statement that his app was not meant for “poor countries like India”. “The incidents hit me hard and I began to introspect. I decided to create a social media platform based in India,” says the 28-year-old. With his networking experience, Rajasekar was confident about the overall wireframing of the application. But he wasn’t sure how things worked in the real world. Which is why he met Ankush Sachdeva, CEO of ShareChat, in Bangalore in 2017. “I had the idea and Ankush had the team, I thought we could work together. But he turned down the offer,” he says. He was also in contact with Kavin Bharti Mittal, CEO of Hike messenger, “Since I’m a newcomer, I was very nervous. I contacted them mainly to understand the workflow,” he adds. It was his father who came to his rescue. The real challenge, Rajasekar says, was to convince his farmer-father about the start-up. For Pixalive to come alive, he had to pledge his only asset — agricultural land. How it works A simple search on Google Play results in scores of applications that offer a variety of services. But what if there was an app that brought together all the features under one umbrella? This was the brainchild of Rajasekar Sundaresan. “There are two ways of looking at it. Firstly, the app is made in India, which means that your data is safe here. And secondly, people are dependent on various applications that consume both time and memory. For instance, they use TikTok and Dubsmash for videos, Instagram for photos and so on. With Pixalive, we wanted to develop an user-friendly app,” he explains. On the surface, Pixalive is divided into five regions and has three feeds — Following, For Me and Near Me. While basic features include text, photo and video, the app stands out with its voice-to-text conversion, which Rajasekar believes will be helpful for less-privileged users. It has a discover option that allows users to follow people. The app comes with a predefined algorithm that lists ‘must-follow’ users, shortlisted based on the number of likes for their posts. Another highlight is its distance option, that displays content trending around a particular locality. But where the app falters is that the posts will automatically disappear after seven days. Rajasekar is ecstatic that Pixalive has garnered over 60,000 downloads and 57,000 active members from over 100 countries, since its launch in December last year. Basking in the glory, Rajasekar is equally puzzled about the reception, “Even for Snapchat, it took eight months to get that reach. I think people must have watched my speech that’s gone viral.” When Rajasekar started out, nobody believed his vision, “Now, a lot of investors are approaching me,” he smiles.

Kollywood: What lies ahead|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|If 2018 was a year of change for Kollywood, 2019 promises to see faster transformation in terms of film production and marketing. The superstars will continue to dominate the trade, expanding the market outside Tamil Nadu. One of the most significant trends of 2018 was the growth of Tamil films in the domestic market (excluding Tamil Nadu). Today, major Kannada and Malayalam producers have turned distributors for Tamil films in their home State. They find it more lucrative than making films in their own languages. A point to be noted is that the Hindi dubbed version of Rajinikanth’s2.0grossed more than the Tamil version — a feat that hasn’t happened before! The Southern states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala are becoming a bigger market for certain Tamil stars. A few years back, 90% of the revenue for a big film came from Tamil Nadu. But today, the other states’ revenue for a Rajinikanth or a Vijay film is as high as 40% of the total sale of theatrical and other rights. Transcending boundaries The overseas market is expanding to newer horizons. In the US,2.0’s theatrical revenue matched some of the big Bollywood films. Tamil films are now releasing in places like Poland, Russia and Ukraine. There are so many new players who are willing to pay extra bucks for the big hero films. In a year, the market value of a star’s film has almost doubled in the overseas sector. However, Tamil films are yet to crack the Chinese market. Will2.0manage to rake in the moolah in China when it releases in May 2019? China is all set to become the world’s biggest film market by 2021, overtaking the US, though it has its restrictions (only 34 foreign films a year). A few Bollywood films likeDangal,Secret Superstar,Bajrangi BhaijaanandHindi Mediumdid extraordinary business there. However, it witnessed a decline after recent failures likePadmanandThugs of Hindostan. The buzz is that2.0is likely to do decent business, considering howTransformers: The Last Knightdid extraordinary numbers in China. But China remains the last frontier for Tamil films, withMersalyet to be released. The South Indian films that had larger-than-life characters (theBaahubaliseries also received lukewarm response) are yet to find acceptance among the Chinese masses. Winds of change What kind of content will Tamil cinema offer in 2019? Yes, there will be more films catering to multiplex audience since women-centric films have scored big last year. Rural-based stories have lost their charm outside the State. Still, you may find a lot of caste-based themes in 2019. The rural entertainers laced with a strong message likeKadaikutty Singamwill continue to draw audiences in the B and C centres. Now, the big question is: what’s the case with smaller films featuring lesser-known actors? Producing a Tamil film is no longer easy, as finance has dried up and television channels have stopped buying small films (Jyotika’sKaatrin Mozhisatellite rights are yet to be sold). In addition, the Tamil Film Producers’ Council has disbanded its release regulation committee and it’s free for all. Leading producer G Dhananjayan said, “In 2018, 95 small-budget films (less than Rs. 3 crore budget) were released, out of which onlyMerku Thodarchi Malaiworked critically and commercially. Most of the other films did not recover even the publicity expenses. Among films made in the Rs. 3-5 crore category, only five films such asIruttu Araiyil Murattu Kuthu, Pyaar Prema Kaadhal, Pariyerum Perumal, U TurnandThuppakki Munaiworked commercially. It clearly indicates that small films have very limited opportunity to succeed and the future looks bleak.” Currently, the hot topic in Kollywood is the clash betweenPettaandViswasamthis Pongal. According to the trade, the release dates for the next three months have been locked by influential producers and distributors. Unlike previous years, the multiplexes will now call the shots Producers are now migrating to OTT platforms, which are slowly gaining momentum. 2019, in many ways, is going to be a landmark year as the production and business of Tamil films are going through a metamorphosis. Nevertheless, the show must go on.|0|
The first time I…|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The first time Iwitnessed how car-crazy Italians really are I’ve heard about car-mad Italians heading to Fiorano just to be able to stand outside Ferrari’s test track and watch through the cracks on the walls while the supercar maker’s drivers tested their latest cars. But to witness first-hand how passionate they are was a different experience all together. I was in Maranello, Italy, to test-drive the 458 Italia; it was just a few days since the convertible had been launched. Getting on to the highway near Ferrari’s wind tunnel facility was easy in the morning and I was taking the opportunity to drive top-down despite the nip in the air. Surprisingly, I kept hearing a lot of honking, something that is very rare on European roads. It was only after a truck driver from two lanes away honked and waved to me that I realised that they were all appreciating the car. All through the day while I drove, other cars would pull close and passengers would stick their heads out to shout ‘Bellissimo’ (handsome; alas not me!). At the lunch and coffee stops, random people came up to see the car and strike up a conversation, including a few cops. Heading back to the hotel in the evening, I was accosted by a couple of drivers in Lamborghinis who sandwiched me in between and wanted me to race them. That one sweeping, windy stretch of the highway was reverberating with the angry exhaust notes of three super cars.  Consulting Motoring Editor,The Hindu BusinessLine|0|
For the love of music|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The rush of vehicles trying to find a parking spot near the concert area was a reminder of the love and respect that SP Balasubrahmanyam commands. The open ground near CODISSIA had been converted into an open-air concert venue and, as I found my seat on a side row, I watched the excited faces of people as they sat down and prepared to be entertained. On the stage, lit by colourful focus lights, Udhaya Ragam, UK Murali’s orchestra, was testing the instruments and getting ready to rock the night away. Once the anchor Mohana had greeted the audience, the show began with a devotional song and some numbers by the other singers. The audience was restless and I could hear whispers of ‘maranawaiting’ from some youngsters, as they waited for SPB to take the stage. When the legendary singer entered quietly without any fanfare, claps, whistles and cheers thundered over the open ground. He made a short speech wishing everyone for New Year and Pongal and requested audience members to do away with caste, racial and gender discrimination. The first number he sang along with Sharanya Srinivas was ‘Andhi mazhai’ fromRaja Parvai. In between the various numbers, he spoke about working with people like MS Vishwanathan, Ilaiyaraaja, AR Rahman and others and lauded their contributions to the film industry. He also spoke of his happiness when KJ Yesudas sang ‘Agaram ippo sigaram achu’ forSigaram, for which he scored the music. Vairamuthu’s poetic lyrics and Yesudas’s singing made the film’s music a great success, he added, as Subish rendered the number beautifully. On the LED screens that dotted the place, I could see the enthusiastic reactions of the audience. The songs selected for the show ranged from the 1970s to the 2000s, whether it was ‘Namthana namthana thalam’ fromPuthiya Varpugal(along with Sumega), Sippi irukkuthu muthum irukkuthu fromVarumayin Niram Sivappuand Valai osai fromSathya(with Sharanya) and Anjali Anjali fromDuetand Azhagooril Poothavale (Thirumalai) with Roshini. SPB’s solos — the rambunctious Megam Kottatum (Enakkul Oruvan) and the haunting Vaanuyarntha solaiyile (Idhaya Kovil) — brought the house down. He also sang the famous Dalapathi numberKaatukuyilu Manaskullewith Subish to much applause. Sumega and Sharanya also had solos isBombay’sKannalane andJohnny’sKaatril Enthan Geetham respectively. Ravindra Prasad’s table playing kept the energy level high through the concert. When the end came withSakkalakala Vallavan’s ‘Ilamai Itho Itho’, everyone was on their feet dancing. While the organisation was impeccable with the police regulating traffic and ensuring that there were no parking issues, what disturbed me was people’s irresponsibility in littering the grounds. When the concert was over, the ground was covered with plastic water bottle, aluminium food containers and all sorts of rubbish. Everyone went home relaxed after listening to some fabulous music. Nobody spared a thought for those who would be left to clean the mess. What a pity that such a fabulous evening had to end this way!|0|
Sathya Sankaran|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Bicycle Mayor, Bengaluru, 2018 An activist and passionate cyclist, Sathya has been working towards the cause of promoting cycles in Bengaluru, for quite some time. During his 40-kilometre commute to work, he realised how badly Bengaluru roads need to be de-congested.  Efforts as Bicycle Mayor The latest one was a challenge thrown by him to Bengalureans, to cycle to work. Companies or a group of employees could register on cycleto.work and well, cycle to work. The teams clocking the highest number of hours and kilometres will be rewarded at the end of the challenge. The idea is not just to encourage people to cycle, but also to track the number of cyclists in the city and popular routes taken by them, present this data to the authorities concerned, and press them to invest in bicycle infrastructure in the city. He has also been pressing for carriageways to be maintained by the authorities for cyclists to have a smooth ride. Sathya prepared a detailed policy plan/proposal detailing such issues and submitted it to the relevant department. Sathya is also associated with the Bike School, Council for Change and Cycle Day events held across Bengaluru. The United Nations General Assembly declared June 3 as World Bicycle Day and Sathya led a 10-km ride with 100 cyclists in the city. “I must add thatThe Hinduhas played a big role in Cycle Days celebrated in different locations in the city.”  The road ahead “The most important objective is to get motorists to respect and not harass cyclists and walkers in 2019. We are working on visual aids, social media material, and screenings to get the message across. We are in the process of designing stickers emblazoned with ‘I respect cyclists’ and putting it on auto rickshaws. As they spread this message, they themselves will become aware of their actions. It is common for motorists to threaten and harass cyclists in Bengaluru and I also experienced an incident where I was almost killed,” says Sathya, who has also co-founded two NGOs Citizens for Sustainability and Praja RAAG. BBMP is supposed to construct 72 kilometres of new cycle tracks, but the plan is stuck due to lack of funds. However, there are a few cycle tracks in place. Public bike sharing isthriving with app-based dockless Yulu Bikes and Mobycy, though Pedl has temporarily stopped its service to work on the quality of its bikes. Directorate of Urban Land Transport was also supposed to launch Namma Trin-Trin bicycles at 40 metro stations in October last year.“I have no idea about it but we need more operators urgently. There are 4,000 bikes available but the demand is for 20,000 bikes,” says Sathya.|0|

Additionally, the V-Class comes with a luxury sleeper option, where the rear-most seats fold to form a bed. However, it remains to be seen whether this option makes it to the Indian model. Expect a single-engine option on the India-bound V-Class. Prices for the V-Class are likely to start around Rs. 75-80 lakh (ex-showroom).|0|
Talent at the table|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Karthika Srinivas is in the news for giving a subjective and an immersive experience to the viewers as an editor ofAntariksham. He has been in the industry since 2013 and worked as Marthand Venkatesh’s assistant and associate; From100% Love,he began working independently. He made a mark with films like1-Nenokkadine,Hello Guru Premakosameand nowAntariksham. There are 17 more in the pipeline, he informs. Machilipatnam-based Karthika came to Hyderabad after finishing a course in multimedia in Vijayawada. He worked with editor Shankar before moving to work with Marthand Venkatesh. “Those days Avid was quite popular, it made my work easier and I learnt quite a lot during the shoot ofAarya. We liking the film is different and conveying it in an appealing way to the audience is altogether a different ball game. Narrating a scene through screenplay in a single shot interestingly was Marthand’s forte. We can open a scene in a room through a wide shot and show a person talking to three people simultaneously. We can also show the same by showing one person talking to them through a cutting process, shifting attention from one to the other,” shares Karthika enthusiastically. It has become common for directors to shoot four-plus hours of footage when all they require is two and a half hour of narration, with an additional half hour to choose and play with. Karthika concurs that it has become a strain on the editors. The directors think they are giving a lot of options for the editor to choose from for a correct angle but that, in fact, is a cumbersome process. He says, “Earlier we have been given one lakh feet to 120 feet exposure for big films. It is expensive and stressful. Avid has made our work easier but, for making one hour reel compact, we edit for seven hours making sure an angle, shot, or expression is good and is in continuity. When we see the rushes, we know for sure which is the best one. Later we make sure we don’t miss it and add some more. We keep taking opinions of so many assistants in the edit room and do the necessary corrections.” Karthika feels that working on1 Nenokkadine,AntarikshamandKarthikeyagave him immense satisfaction. Ask Karthika, the challenging part of the film, and he states the obvious. Editing the film without sound in green mat is a test of ability. In the editing room, Karthika sometimes works on some 600 CG shots to narrows it down to 200. An editor sees a film a 100 times till it goes to the censor, and everyday he feels something new can be done. Karthika cherishes the challenges. with His next project is a biopic on a student leader of Osmania University calledGeorge Reddy.Jeevan is the director.|0|
Back to the future|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|"An exhibition marking Ashok Leyland’s 70th anniversary last year featured two restored Austins: an A40 Devon that the company assembled and sold in India; an Austin A40 Somerset, standing amidst symbols of electric-vehicle (EV) technology. The shell of the car was all Somerset, but its soul had been recast with this technology, an exercise that signifed a convergence of the past and the future. Titled ‘Back To The Future’, it describes the place EVs are beginning to reclaim. Yes, reclaim. Let me illustrate . In 2014, Formula E emerged as a new form of motor racing, one driven entirely by EV technology. The championship has the official mark of the Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile and the technology has been improving rapidly over the years. As the 2018-2019 season is underway, we see a Gen 2 electric racing car scorch the tarmac. If you compared the specs of the Gen 1 and Gen 2 race cars, you’ll see the tech spikes. The new Formula E electric race car has more zip, and with a new battery, greater ‘staying power’. Reportedly twice as powerful as the previous one, the battery can now last the entire course of a race. The competition has also been getting fiercer. According to information posted at ABB Formula-E’s official website fiaformulae.com, the sixth season (2019-2020) will get more intense, with one more heavyweight, Mercedes-Benz, joining the fray. Our own Mahindra Racing, the motor racing wing of the Mahindra Group, is one of the teams in the Formula E series. Now, let us rewind to the early 1900s, and zoom in on the race tracks of those days. Any analysis of racing seasons back then will have three sections: automobiles with engines running on gasoline (a North American term for petrol), steam-powered automobiles, and electric automobiles. In an account of a racing season published in its edition dated January 30, 1904,Scientific American, a weekly, treats track records of electric automobiles and those involving gasoline-run automobiles, with an almost equal importance. The listed track records are quite revealing. For example, “the Baker electric torpedo"", which seems to be quite a popular electric racecar of those times, wins the 10-mile race in 17 minutes and 58 seconds. And, in their categories, two cars running on gasoline, are listed as having completed 10 miles in the nine to 10 minutes range. Contrary to what we may assume, EVs continued to be present , if only on the periphery, despite gasoline-run vehicles gaining rapidly in popularity as a result of more refined engines. The impressive success achieved by Detroit Electric illustrates this. Anderson Electric Car Company made an electric car titled Detroit Electric that was in production from 1907 to 1939. Though tortoise-fast, this electric car seemed to impress automobile-loving Americans with how much ground it could cover on a charge. It is said to have scored high on manoeuvrability . One of the Americans sold on the Detroit Electric was Clara Ford, the wife of the man who brought the three ‘A’s together — automobiles, affordability, and the American Dream. Henry Ford’s wife’s attachment to the Detroit Electric car is part of automobile lore. You may read about it at thehenryford.org, and see it at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, where a 1914 Detroit Electric Model 47 Brougham, owned by Clara, is on display. In 2008, the Detroit Electric brand was revived, and eight years later, an electric performance car called Detroit Electric SP.01 was made. And 2018 showed that in certain pockets of the world, especially China and the UK, EV goals are being pursued with great intensity. In October, the Dundee City Council from the United Kingdom received the title ‘Europe’s most visionary electric vehicle city’ from the World Electric Vehicle Association, for ensuring that two-fifth of its fleet consists of EVs and for creating an ecosystem encouraging people to opt for them. Another sign that we are accelerating towards this future is Lamborghini taking the wraps off the Terzo Millennio, an electric concept car produced in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  A charged past In 1901, Thomas Edison made a Nickel-Iron battery for Electric Vehicles."|0|
Pushing for a smooth ride|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The concept of bicycle mayors was unknown to many of us until we had four appointed for the two-year honorary position in Vadodara, Valsad, Guwahati, and Bengaluru in quick successions in 2017-18. Over these two years, Nikita Lalwani in Vadodara, Bhairavi Joshi in Valsad, Arshel Akhter in Guwahati, and Sathya Sankaran in Bengaluru have been actively engaging with citizens and the Governments of their cities through sustained campaigns and events, to promote the cause of cycling. Bicycle mayor is a programme run by BYCS, an Amsterdam-based NGO, which is pursuing its goal of 50/30. The idea is to get people in all the cities in the world to make half of their trips by bikes and thus preserve the earth. As of now, there are 15 bicycle mayors across the world, the youngest of whom is Lotta Crok, an 8-year-old from Amsterdam. We speak to three bicycle mayors from India to find out the progress made so far and the road ahead.|0|

He decided to wear his social status as an armour after being constantly denied opportunities. Hailing from a humble family of farmers in Krishnagiri, Rajasekar was passionate about engineering, but wasn’t financially ready. There was a ray of hope when he met Dr APJ Abdul Kalam at MIT. Armed with a degree in electronic engineering,Rajasekar was doing good for himself as a network engineer in Wipro. He was supposed to get hitched, but the bride’s parents discreetly married their daughter to a wealthy groom.

What we see in the stars|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|We’ve often seen actors playing larger-than-life characters on the big screen. But what if their life-sized characters were shrunk to tiny models? This was the question that drove iKix My3D to create miniature models of famous personalities, including the late Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa, Rajinikanth, Kamal Haasan, Vijay Sethupathi and Anirudh Ravichander, to mention a few. iKix India, a company that has been in the business of designing 3D architectural models for over a decade, started its sister concern — iKix My3D — in April 2018, to create 3D printed replicas of celebrities for its customers. “Since we are experienced in architectural modelling, we thought of creating 3D character models, which have become big in the US. And that’s how our journey began,” says Praveen Daniel, Location Head, iKix My3D, adding that the company roped in people trained in graphic designing softwares like Maya. Behind the walls Given that Tamil Nadu worships cine stars, it isn’t surprising that the statuettes of film personalities are a hit among customers. But the company’s speciality lies in its customised figurines that come with a predefined shape and size. For instance, if someone wants his/her own miniature model, then he/she is asked to send their photos to iKix My3D. The designers study the photo and first develop the front and side views first. A rough sketch is sent back to the customer for confirmation. After getting it approved, the team creates the entire model, which is sent for printing using the 3D printer. “Our competitors use FDM 3D printing, while we use sandstone. When we get the photos, we start printing them layer-by-layer,” says Thayumanavan, one of the designers. According to him, the whole process usually takes a week, “There are a lot of options for customised figurines. Either they can select from the available models or specify their own requirements.” The company was flooded with orders of customised Santa Claus figurines for Christmas. “If you look at any household during Christmas, people will invariably use the same Santa Claus doll every year. With our 3D modelling, we are able to merge our customer’s face on to the Santa itself,” says Daniel, adding that the Santa models were selling like hot cakes in the US. While the figurines look adorable, not everybody can afford them, because the models are priced between Rs. 2,000 and Rs. 9,000, depending on the size. “There’s a difference between plastic and ceramic. Yes, we can produce the models at Rs. 1,000. But we don’t want to do that. For natural look and feel, you shouldn’t think twice about spending extra.” Say hi to 3.0 WhenEnthiranreleased in 2010, Daniel was contemplating creating a miniature model of the eponymous character 2.0. The dust has settled, and Praveen and his team have now designed the miniature version of 3.0, the tiny robot from the recently-released2.0. “On the 100th day celebration, we’re planning to gift our models to the2.0team,” says Daniel, adding that they have already received a huge order from Malaysia for the Rajinikanth statuette. The 3.0 models, in particular, are being sold at Rs. 2,000-3,000. iKix My3D models can be ordered online.

‘I killed my youth working’|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Harris Jayaraj’s Studio H at Valasaravakkam, Chennai, is an impressive structure with plenty of open spaces inside. There are a few office rooms, which lead you to a garden and swimming pool. Harris’ residence is right behind — he can quickly saunter over if a tune needs fixing. The composer had a quiet 2018, but he had a good end to the year, with the release ofDev’s (starring Karthi, the film will also release in Telugu) album. In an interview, he chats about the film’s songs, staying relevant and why his songs tend to sound similar. Excerpts: You’ve mentioned earlier how your relationship with directors is important. WhenDev’s director Rajath Ravishankar came to you, what struck you about him and the subject? I liked the story and thought that I could justify it musically. I firmly believe that the director is the captain of the ship... he is responsible for everything! (laughs) Rajath had a certain vision and he could envision the film in his head. The producer (Lakshman Kumar) was also passionate about it. I see the director and producer as husband and wife. We are their kids! Would you callDeva return to the brand of music Harris is known for? I don’t know if I would describe it as a ‘brand of music’, but composing for young films has always been my favourite. I love to write music for young subjects. We can work from our heart, have fun with the score, and do not need to follow ‘Kodambakkam rules’ while doing so. I come from that school of music — all my songs in the films of Gautham Menon and Jeeva have been like that. Unfortunately, I haven’t seen a genuine young film for the past 10 years. But you didNanban (Snehitudu in Telugu)... But that’s for a Superstar. It was the character of a young chap played by a superstar. This meant that we had to fulfil fans’ expectations. But if you listen toUllam Ketkumae,12Bor evenDev, you’ll know how we are not forced to come up with even one track for the hero, which was not part of the storyline. You’ve worked on many superhit songs for Suriya, but this is your first film with his brother, Karthi... Whenever I met Karthi, he kept telling me that he wanted to be in a film that had my music. But it just didn’t fall in place till now. Karthi was doing a lot of local, rowdy-ish roles back then, and kept saying that he needed to look really good if he were to do a film that had my songs. Thankfully,Devhas brought us together. Is it fair to say that you have been concentrating on quality rather than quantity in the last couple of years? I’ve been doing that for the past 18 years, ever since I started composing for films. I hardly work on more than three films a year. In fact, in 2009, I had only one release (Orange). The reason for that is simple: when I got launched as a composer withMinnale, I was tired... because I had already worked as a musician for more than 600 films, in several languages. When I was a keyboard player, I used to finish a film within a couple of days. When you rush things, you forget ‘quality’ and concentrate on how many projects you took up. I believe that I killed my youth working. So when I débuted as composer, I told myself that I’d concentrate only on quality. A film can fail at the box office, but music won’t. You created a fresh soundscape withMinnale (Cheli). How did you bypass ‘Kodambakkam rules’ of the time? I was lucky to have the support and vision of a director like Gautham Menon, and producer Murali Manohar. The success ofMinnale’s soundtrack proved that audiences liked to hear something different, something that didn’t go with the usual ‘Kodambakkam music grammar’ of the time. That gave way to albums like12BandUnnale Unnale.I’m also fortunate that senior directors like Murugadoss and Shankar accepted my style of music.  A common criticism for your songs is that they tend to sound similar. See, that’s my signature. If someone hears a song of mine and immediately says that it is a Harris number, it means that I’ve succeeded. Every composer has a signature — you can play any track of Hans Zimmer to me, and I’ll know it’s his work without you telling me. Are there occasions when you have worked on a single number for a long time? If you are overdoing a song, it means that there is something basically wrong with the tune. Just because you work on a tune for 100 days doesn’t mean that it will become a superhit. Magic happens within a single recording session. Finally, I have seen many Tamil stand-up comedians taking friendly jibes at your music. Are you aware of these? Yes, I have watched those videos. It’s their way of putting things together. I appreciate their talent, but not the intention.  Karthi kept telling me that he needed to look really good if he were to do a film that had my songs. Thankfully,Devbrought us together|0|
‘Every experience informs us and creates us as individuals’|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|There is gratitude and nostalgia in your recital. What’s the motivation? Within the guru-shishya relationship, there is a lot of gratitude in the exchange of not only art and culture, but as part of life. It’s a spill over of how teachers impart to students a way of looking at the world. Studying with someone in a steadfast manner provides more perspectives—more lenses through which we can look at and process the world. The motivation is simple—it is to pay respect to a guru who is no longer physically here, and to show others what she has imparted to us as students, and to share her creativity with others. Tell us the innovative work and approach by Spilling Ink in taking art traditions forward. The mission and focus of Spilling Ink, an organisation based in Washington, DC is to increase access to classical Indian arts through a wide variety of media. Our work is rooted in tradition, created with vision and performed for transformation. We often work on projects that are based in classical Indian dance, but align other art forms including poetry, drama, theatre and visual arts to increase accessibility to the projects. Our laser focus is to spread these art forms among those who may be unfamiliar. We always consider assumptions of how much our audiences know — or don’t know. Therefore, it allows us to develop strong narratives that help audiences gain an experience of art, in which they play a role in interpretation, rather than us trying to force a lot of cultural and artistic materials that they may or may not grasp. You mentioned even a smallest excuse would bring you back to India. Explain this unique bond. Having dedicated a large part of my life to the arts, I crave the context that India provides. In the United States, I feel very disconnected. And so yes, I feel my soul is here, but I live there. But I think my work is serving some purpose to propagate the Indian classical arts in a different context — that brings up a level of satisfaction and meaning for me in terms of why I do what I do. I think identity is an important consideration. Artistes look at this topic a lot — and we discuss it a lot. I think for artistes, especially those of who span very different careers (I have a parallel career working for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in Washington, DC—the central bank of the United States), this idea of avatars constantly comes into play. Some days you’ve done so many things in both realms that you wonder who you are at the end of it. But that’s exciting. And I think every experience informs us and creates us as individuals. Your future projects? I am looking forward to the performance on Wednesday. It will be an organic coming together of artistry among so many people. It’s nice to spend time with other artists and create — whether it’s revisiting works or creating new ones. The practice and performance of dance is ephemeral, so when we work, the experience is new each time. That’s very exciting. Spilling Ink is currently producing an art/dance film that traces the breadth of river Godavari — from Andhra Pradesh to Maharashtra. The river is allegory for one’s identity. Another project we are working on is a collaboration with the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC. We’re creating a new work that activates their Freer& Sackler galleries that deal with Asian art.|0|
A renaissance for the seenagers|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|What is life without a little fun? Retirement pension plans are one thing and deciding to make the most of the retired days is another. Next time you hear your elderly aunt is planning a Vegas trip instead of a pilgrimage, take pride in having a seenager in your family. Meet the seenagers — senior teenagers, who are aggressively opting for smart phones instead of phones with qwerty key pads, are saying no to portable transistors and embracing iPads and iPods, Hungama Radio becomes a must have, their phones have the YouTube app and they prefer the smart TV for their choice of shows. This has led us to witness groups of crisply-dressed, silver-haired people chatting away at coffee shops. Life for some seniors is at their rocking best. Seenagers are setting serious examples of life goals to the younger lot. Seenagers are those who have not let age slow them down. So much so that despite starting their fitness journey late they are not shying away from being part of triathlons, treks and adventure sports, giving youngsters a run for their money. What makes them restless when they are told to slow down and be at home? The vernacular Author and columnist Mitra Phukan is in love with the term seenager. When she came across the word, she wrote on her Facebook wall, “Seenager, senior teenager, perfectly describes me and my friends.” Isn’t she worried about people sniggering behind her back? “Being a seenager is so much more fun than it was being a teenager. No pimples, only wrinkles. I can handle that. Future seems less uncertain now since only a few years are left anyway. One can dance the night away because there are no job pressures the next day. And mostly, one can say and do whatever one likes and get away with it because it will be ascribed to senility. What fun!” It does sound like a lot of fun and who wouldn’t want to have fun without worries. That some seenagers are tech savvy helps them have more fun. It keeps them connected and so the desire to do fun things is on the priority list. Mitra says, sometimes even catching up with friends at a coffee shop or having a fun lunch makes a world of difference.” Urban choices Seenagers from metro cities attribute a lot of their social life to the fact that there are cab services and do not visualise themselves as just endless channel surfers on television. “I am on Facebook only because I like to watch videos, see the fun things people do with their lives and get inspired. I refuse to slow down now. I travel every three months with a small group of friends. If going out of town is not possible, we do sleep overs,” says Prasanna Narayan, a retired lecturer. Prasanna says otherwise she takes a mini vacation to any beach destination within the country. “I do not stay for long because I leave my dogs in the hostel,” she adds. If that is how Prasanna chose to keep herself busy, Zubeida Mehdi, a homemaker and a grandmother of two says, “when I need to babysit, I will. When I need to put on my joggers and go on treasure hunts, I will. Our community supports freedom of women. So we do a lot of fun things in our groups for women. Give me a car and put me behind the wheels, I bet my daughter will lose a race with me,” laughs Zubeida. She she doesn’t like it when people take it for granted that women are not good drivers. For Sarita Akam, a game of cards with her friends, having good food and then hanging out with her daughters over some good gossip is time well spent. She is up to date when it comes to her favourite shows, often winding down with the latestBigg BossorIndian Idol. “I worked while living abroad but coming back home, it has been really nice to connect with myself and getting into my hobbies once again... especially now that the kids are older.” That sure is a good goal. So the millennials who think people of landline generation are outdated, think twice, some seenager might roll you up in a slang which you won’t find even in Urban Dictionary.  Being a seenager is so much more fun than it was being a teenager. No pimples, only wrinkles. I can handle that. Future seems less uncertain now since only a few years are left anyway.

Up and down and round and round|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|In an age of bullet trains, express ways, and long haul flights, choosing a bicycle as a means of touring still presents a challenge. While there have been people who have toured the world on a bicycle since it was invented, it is still difficult to navigate even familiar cities today thanks to issues like safety, weather, road conditions, traffic, on-road support, and so on. In 2010, to give more cyclists an opportunity to cycle in properly organised tours, Tamil Nadu Cycling Club (TCC), a Chennai-based not-for-profit organisation, began organising an annual cycling tour in partnership with The Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation. Vasanth Ramaswamy, Secretary TCC and curator of the tour, outlines the objective of the tour as “to promote eco-tourism in the state of Tamil Nadu and provide a platform for touring on cycles”. Given the vastness and diversity of Tamil Nadu, TCC has come out with different themes each year. In the first edition, the tour started in Coimbatore with the theme ‘Mountains’ and offered riders a chance to explore Ooty, Yercaud, and Kodaikanal. The subsequent editions explored themes like heritage sites, cuisines, the Eastern Ghats, Western ghats, the Nilgiris and wildlife. The focus was on visiting places that are intricately linked to these themes. The theme this year was ‘Waterfalls’ and the ride covered four waterfalls in Northwest Tamil Nadu. The tours typically start and end at one of the major towns in Tamil Nadu; this time, it was Erode. The intermediate halts over the next seven days were at Hogenekkal, Yercaud, Kallakuruchi and Kolli Hills. Forty five riders, including five women, participated. The route for different days were designed to provide a variety of experiences; flat sections, uphill rides that test one’s determination, downhill rides that require good control, frustrating headwinds and tailwinds that provided much-wanted relief. “We avoid National Highways as much as possible as they offer very limited scenic beauty and most are all about speed,” says Venkat Venkatadri, one of the key organisers. The first day from Erode to Hogenekkal passed through some beautiful roads that had stiff headwinds and the second day had steep inclines. After a more relaxed third at Yercaud that was all about scenery, the fourth and fifth day offered gentle climbs in the Kalrayan Hills. The toughest one was reserved for the sixth day when riders ascended the Kolli hills. The last day was a ceremonial easy ride back to Erode. When asked how this tour compared to the prestigious Tour de France, Rajaram Pattabiraman, the tour director, quickly dismisses the inevitable comparisons, “This is not a race; it is a tour. It is immaterial whether someone rides fast or slow, the entire distance or partially, all days or some days... We want each participant to enjoy the tour and will offer support and recognition to all riders in the best possible manner.” The participants came from all over the country including a few international riders. They were from all walks of life and of all ages. For many, especially those from other parts of India, it was a new experience to ride through Tamil Nadu in places that they had rarely heard about. It is not always the destination that counts but also the journey. One may not find a small town like Kallakuruchi very romantic but, when reached through the Kalrayan Hills and breathtaking views of Gomukhi dam, it is a place worth visiting. Riding up to the hill stations helps one enjoy every bit of the view from the top and a sense of accomplishment. Modern highways bye-pass most small towns and link only the major cities. Cycling through small towns helps us connect with many wonderful people and institutions. The friendly cheers from children make each rider feel like a celebrity. It also offers us a chance to try local cuisine and get a closer look at local customs and traditions. It is an opportunity to pay heed to what songwriter and entertainer Eddie Cantor said, “Slow down and enjoy life. It’s not only the scenery you miss by going to fast; you also miss the sense of where you are going and why.”  We now have a repository of route maps, information on hotels that are cycling-friendly, and other support. .We plan to create a portal with this information and make it available to the general public Vasanth RamaswamySecretary TCC  Pedal winners The tour covered four waterfalls:Hogenekkal, Kiliyur in Yercaud, Periyar in Kalrayan Hils and Agaiya Gangai in Kolli Hills  There were45 ridersincluding five women  The distance covered was852 km  The total elevation was11,111m  The total trip tookseven days|0|
Kollywood: What lies ahead|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|If 2018 was a year of change for Kollywood, 2019 promises to see faster transformation in terms of film production and marketing . The superstars will continue to dominate the trade, expanding the market outside Tamil Nadu. One of the most significant trends of 2018 was the growth of Tamil films in the domestic market (excluding Tamil Nadu). Today, major Kannada and Malayalam producers have turned distributors for Tamil films in their home state. They find it more lucrative than making films in their own languages. A point to be noted is that the Hindi dubbed version of Rajinikanth’s2.0grossed more than the Tamil version — a feat that hasn’t happened before! The southern states of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala are becoming a bigger markets for certain Tamil stars. A few years back, 90% of the revenue for a big film came from Tamil Nadu. But today, the other states revenue for a Rajinikanth or a Vijay’s film is as high as 40% of the total sale of theatrical and other rights. Transcending boundaries The overseas market is expanding to newer horizons. In the US,2.0’s theatrical revenue matched some of the big Bollywood films. Tamil films are now releasing in places like Poland, Russia and Ukraine. There are so many new players who are willing to pay extra bucks for the big hero films. In a year, the market value of a star’s film has almost doubled in the overseas . However, Tamil films are yet to crack the Chinese market. . Will2.0manage to rake in moolah in China when it releases in May 2019? China is all set to become the world’s biggest film market by 2021, overtaking the US, though it has its its restrictions (only 34 foreign films a year). A few Bollywood films likeDangal,Secret Superstar,Bajrangi BhaijaanandHindi Mediumdid extraordinary business there. However, it witnessed a decline after recent failures likePadmanandThugs Of Hindostan. The buzz is that2.0is likely to do decent business, considering howTransformers: The Last Knightdid extraordinary numbers in China. But China remains the last frontier for Tamil films, withMersalyet to be released. The South Indian films that had larger-than-life characters (theBaahubaliseries also received lukewarm response) are yet to find acceptance among the Chinese masses. Winds of change What kind of content will Tamil cinema offer in 2019? Yes, there will be more films catering to multiplex audience since women-centric films have scored big last year. Rural-based stories have lost their charm outside the state. Still, you may find a lot of caste-based themes in 2019. The rural entertainers laced with a strong message likeKadaikutty Singamwill continue to draw audiences in the B and C centres. Now, the big question is: what’s the case with smaller films featuring lesser known actors? Producing a Tamil film is no longer easy, as finance has dried up and television channels have stopped buying small films (Jyotika’sKaatrin Mozhisatellite rights are yet to be sold). In addition, the Tamil Film Producers’ Council has disbanded its release regulation committee and it’s free for all. Leading producer G Dhananjayan said, “In 2018, 95 small budget films (less than Rs. 3 crore budget) were released, out of which onlyMerku Thodarchi Malaiworked critically and commercially. Most of the other films did not recover even the publicity expenses. Films made in the Rs. 3-5 crore category, only five films such asIruttu Araiyil Muruttu Kuthu, Pyar Prema Kadhal, Pariyerum Perumal, U TurnandThuppakki Munaiworked commercially. It clearly indicates that small films have very limited opportunity to succeed and the future looks bleak.” Currently, the hot topic in Kollywood is the clash betweenPettaandViswasamthis Pongal. According to the trade, the release dates for the next three months have been locked by influential producers and distributors. Unlike previous years, the multiplexes will now call the shots. Producers are now migrating to OTT platforms, which are gaining momentum. 2019, in many ways, is going to be a landmark year as the production and business of Tamil films are going through a metamorphosis. Nevertheless, the show must go on.|0|
Unacceptable, but so very acceptable|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|If I was a builder who built a sub-standard building that collapsed and killed a few people, or if I was an engineer who inspected and certified such a building as safe, I would be arrested. If I was not very rich, I would probably do some jail time too. I think it is also safe to assume that the State would chip in and offer compensation for the deaths. It does so in cases of accidents, fires, or bridges falling. Funny, then, that a city should simply shake off responsibility when its own municipality is directly responsible for the safety and maintenance of the space. The failure to maintain roads can, and does lead to deaths. But somehow, these deaths do not lead to an outcry, or calls for justice and affixing of culpability, the way a building or bridge collapse death would. The Hindureported recently that, between 2013 and 2017, close to 15,000 Indians had died in accidents caused by potholes. Other reports suggest that the government has admitted to over 9,300 deaths and 25,000 people being injured because of potholes over the last three years. Our Supreme Court has described this situation as “unacceptable”. Mumbai, with its nearly five-month monsoon spell, is especially vulnerable to pothole-related damage. In July last year, a young motorcyclist was killed when his bike fell after hitting a pothole. Just days before, two other pothole-related incidents were reported, one involved a pedestrian and another a mother-of-two who was riding pillion on a bike. Recently, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) flatly refused to pay compensation to victims of road accidents, even if these deaths were caused by potholes. A corporator had demanded compensation, in response to which, the BMC said that the roads were the responsibility of the contractors. Getting off scot-free In November, a woman and a six-month-old baby were reported killed when the bike they were riding pillion on skidded on a potholed road in Dadar. The family of four on the bike was thrown off and crushed by an oncoming water tanker. Oddly enough, the police thought it fit to arrest the tanker driver, but not to take any action against those who are responsible for filling potholes on the roads.The BMC has not responded well to criticism of its handling of the pothole situation. When radio jockey Malishka spoofed the ‘Sonu’ song, calling it the ‘Pothole Mix’, changing the lyrics to describe the mess the city is reduced to during the rainy season — potholes, water-logging, traffic and stalling of trains — the Shiv Sena and its corporators responded with outrage, suggesting that she be sued for ‘defaming’ the municipal body. Eventually, the BMC did send a notice to the RJ’s mother, for ‘dengue breeding’ at home.Perhaps, the corporators need to take some lessons from Mumbaikar Dadarao Bilhore. In 2015, his teenage son died in a pothole-related accident. By June 2018, the grieving father had managed to fill up 556 potholes. He did express the hope that the BMC and MMRDA would look at people and be inspired to do a better job. Bilhore has shown that it can be done quickly and efficiently. It is, nevertheless, a great tragedy that heartbroken citizens should have to do a job for which taxpayers are already paying municipalities and their contractors. Perhaps, the courts need to do more than say “unacceptable”. The author is a writer of essays, stories, poems and scripts for stage and screen  The failure to maintain roads can, and does lead to deaths  Ditch the ditch In Bengaluru, a social venture by a group of citizens called ‘Pothole Raja’ has fixed more than 4,500 potholes in the city.|0|
Heartfelt tribute to guru|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Vijay Palaparty, co-artistic director and president of Spilling Ink and Dr Jwala Srikala , Radiologist, KIMS usher in the New Year with a performance dedicated to their Kuchipudi dance guru Uma Rama Rao. The disciples have came together to honour her contribution in their dance and lives. Of traditional and rare items The repertoire will include a mix of popular traditional items and some unknown pieced choreographed by Uma Rama Rao, fondly called Uma aunty. Dr Jwala shares the Kuchipudi doyen who passed away in the same year as Carnatic doyen Balamurali Krishna were good friends. “She was also the first one to adopt his Omkaravarnamfor the Shanmukha priya dance.” Dance connoisseurs used to watching Siddhendra Yogi’s ‘Bhama Kalapam’ will get to see a refreshedbhama kalapamwhere the tone is sombre with a note of surrender. Vijay’s recital includes a traditionalDasavatara shabdamand a signature piece,Shivapallika seva prabandhamchoreographed by the guru. Interestingly, thisprabandhamseen in the songKoluvai unnadein K Viswanath’sSwarnakamalamfeaturing Bhanupriya was choreographed by Uma Rama Rao. Vijay planned a series of shows to pay tribute and it took off with a bang with a big performance in California where Uma Rama Rao’s students came together to present her choreographies. With an intent to take it forward, similar concerts have been planned across Bangalore, Chennai and Hyderabad. “Vijay spoke to me and since these concerts are being presented as as memorials, we wondered, ‘why not both of us come together and showcase these rare items’. I was probably the only student who learnt some of these pieces from the guru. I plan to take it forward to the next generation,” she states. Going nostalgic she remembers the days when students visited Hyderabad to train from Uma Rao Rao. “Many students would come in summer from US to learn from her. He (Vijay) was in Standard VI and I was in high school. Uma aunty would choreograph and teach the dance and ask me to supervise,” she smiles. Balancing her professional career and passion, Dr Jwala deals with a crazy schedule. As the director of dance school Lasya Priya, (which was previously run by Uma Rama Rao) she is constantly juggling and wishes if there were few more hours to a day! “It is tough and I don’t want to make it sound like I am doing a great job. It is the madness that gives me the energy.” The disciples hope to take it forward and spread Uma Rama Rao’s distinct work. (Vijay Palaparty and Dr Jwala Srikala present a tribute to Uma Rama Rao at Saptaparni in Banjara Hills on January 2 from 6 30 pmonwards; Entry free)|0|
‘Buy less, choose well’|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Step out today, and you can overhear nervous conversations among people from all walks of life — ranging from vendors of all scales and backgrounds to their customers — about the ban of single-use disposable plastic in Tamil Nadu. Many of us have been in denial of the ban and as a result, are not geared up to make the necessary swaps.  “Almost every environmental issue can be linked to human consumption,” says Amala Aiana. “It is empowering to think ‘I have enough’.” She started using what she had for the renewables, and for what she didn’t have, started reasoning between what she ‘wants’ and what she ‘needs’. Amala’s biological intolerance to processed products was a blessing in disguise which enabled her and the family to switch to organic food and terrace gardening. Without compromising on her personal care needs, Amala discovered brands that leave a minimal carbon footprint by switching to plant-based alternatives, often in powder form that eliminate most plastic packaging, chemicals and preservatives. “One of the easiest switches was compostable bamboo toothbrushes,” she says.  Dhaval is one of the founders of Chennai’s first vegan store, Earth Story. He is also an example of adapting sustainability and mindful living. “I stay in Auroville, in a zero-waste community where reducing things and segregating waste is an integral part of the ecosystem. We have different disposal systems for paper, glass, food waste, plastic and other inorganic waste,” he says. He lives by the words of Vivienne Westwood — ‘Buy less, choose well, make it last’. The ‘R’ that he prioritises is Refuse. He believes that no matter how sustainable a single use disposable material is, it must be refused and replaced with something reusable. He has let go of business cards and encourages e-bills over printed ones. At his store, everyday grocery and supplies also come in a bring-your-own-container alternative to avoid unnecessary packaging. “It all starts with being mindful and making it a habit.”  With the division of roles and responsibilities at home, one of the things Srilatha takes charge of is buying fruits, vegetables, snacks and other monthly groceries. She starts by picking small and local vendors who provide goods in bulk, therefore having no packaging of their own. She equips herself with reusable stainless steel containers, bottles, jars and cloth bags before she heads out to shop. Srilatha also makes it a point to educate every shopkeeper she interacts with on the problems associated with packaging, so that they encourage their customers to follow the ‘bring your own container/packaging’ principle. For the few items that Srilatha does buy with packaging, she makes it a point to return it to the store to be reused/recycled. “Always choose fresh juices that can be filled in your own packaging over pre-packed aerated drinks in plastic bottles. I also grow my greens and vegetables at home and like experimenting with homegrown produce. Some of them include spinach, bitter gourd, curry leaves and a few native vegetables,” she says. she adds. Sudarshana and Veena are sustainability entrepreneurs. They are the co-founders of Two’s Company and Everwards India.

Rocking on diligently|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|In the years that they’ve lied somewhat dormant on the city’s live circuit, Bangaluru rock band Coma Rossi seems to have been diligently putting together its self-titled debut album. The emphasis is on diligently because Coma Rossi clocks in with eight tracks totalling to around 67 minutes. Like most bands, what is evident is thatComa Rossiis an amalgamation of different influences coming together – you can hear a little bit of Dream Theater and Opeth-like progressive rock/metal grandiosity, the Tool-like dexterity and more. And this is just all on their opening track ‘Mirage’, which sets the scene for mammoth, spiralling rock. They turn to ambient rock led movements, not too far removed from the space rock of Pink Floyd on ‘Transmission’, but in their regular steady build-ups on songs like the mostly instrumental ‘Jomolungma Is Far Away’, they end up putting too much emphasis on structure for effect, when they may as well just cut to the chase and get to the gripping parts. Of course, what you get in the process of being a patient listener through the course of an hour is the glimmering skill of everyone in the band – guitarist Gaurav Govilkar, keyboardist Juby Thomas, lead vocalist and guitarist Tom Borah and Udayan Kashalikar on bass and Anupam Panda on drums. They offer no such build-up on the ephemeral ‘Yellow Escape’, which shows off Coma Rossi’s post-rock hues, easily a stand-out track on its own for stargazing nights. Their opus and centrepiece is ‘Dream’, which is about 14-minutes long and retains their cohesive space-rock styling. While Borah’s vocals doesn’t offer always something new like on ‘Stillborn’, there’s mind-bending riffs on display to save it from becoming filler material. Where Borah does finally shine is on the penultimate track ‘Turn Back Time’, an exuberant track that morphs into an emotive plea, placed over cascading drum-work. The closing track ‘Lost’ comes in at a mellow pace, a tad languid but not necessarily in a bad way. Even at over an hour,Coma Rossiisn’t thankfully entirely a laborious listen, because it’s made for prog fans, injected with ambient rock for good effect.

Yogendra Pratap,|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The first time Idrove a vintage car My friend once bought a car for €100, from the widow of its first owner, for whom it was his most prized possession. The car was about the same vintage as I am, and of course I wanted to drive it. So without giving it a second thought, we decided to do an inter-continental drive with it to the capital of Georgia, Tbilisi, and while at it, we also decided to set a non-stop driving record with it! The car was a VAZ-2101 Zhiguli, known behind the iron curtain as the Kopeyka. So in the autumn of 2012, we set out right after the Paris Motor Show. The car was old but it came with its own workshop neatly laid out in its boot, the problem being that we knew nothing about fixing a Zhiguli. Luckily our route took us through eastern Europe, where everyone’s father had owned one and knew how to repair it. When the car broke down, it was quickly repaired, and depending on where it broke down, we had experts working on the car in minutes.

Nikita Lalwani|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Bicycle Mayor, Vadodara, 2017 An instrumentation engineer by profession, she began cycling after her commute time to office doubled due to a flyover construction. She went on to launch the Cycling Cities initiative in 2015, with the objective of inspiring one-third of a city’s population to cycle. Cycling Cities is a mobile app which tracks your cycling time. Based on carbon-credit calculations, cyclists get rewards like gift vouchers, discounts at cycle stores etc. In 2018, she started Tring (Try Cycling), in her office, by providing cycles with helmets on rent, guidance, and support to office-goers, prodding them to cycle. Right now, Tring is in its pilot phase. These efforts got her selected as the first bicycle mayor in India.  Efforts as Bicycle Mayor  “I am really interested in promoting cycling among children, so I have been talking to students who live close to their schools and can cycle. I am encouraging people who live to close to their work to cycle. So, I am talking to various stakeholders,” says Nikita, who has also initiated Baroda by Cycle on April 18, World Heritage Day. These are guided tours curated by heritage experts. Nikita collaborated with Vadodara Municipal Corporation to celebrate World Car Free Day on September 22 this year, along with several countries across the world. People were encouraged to take up a one-week car challenge, where they would give up cars for a week and cycle. Several talks, discussions and events also took place. There are about 2,000 hobby cyclists in the city today, but not bike lanes.|0|
Sathya Sankaran|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|Bicycle Mayor, Bengaluru, 2018 An activist and passionate cyclist, Sathya has been working towards the cause of promoting cycles in Bengaluru, for quite some time. During his 40-km commute to work, he realised how badly Bengaluru roads need to be de-congested.  Efforts as Bicycle Mayor The latest one was a challenge thrown by him to Bengalureans to cycle to work. Companies or a group of employees could register on cycleto.work and well, cycle to work. The teams clocking the highest number of hours and km will be rewarded at the end of the challenge. The idea is not just to encourage people to cycle, but also to track the number of cyclists in the city, popular routes taken by them and present this data to the authorities concerned and press them to invest in bicycle infrastructure in the city. He has also been pressing for carriageways to be maintained by the authorities for cyclists to have a smooth ride. Sathya prepared a detailed policy plan/proposal detailing such issues and submitted it to the relevant department. Sathya is also associated with the Bike School, Council for Change and Cycle Day events held across Bengaluru. The United Nations General Assembly declared June 3 as World Bicycle Day and Sathya led a 10-km ride with 100 cyclists in the city. “I must add thatThe Hinduhas played a big role in Cycle Days celebrated in different locations in the city.”  The road ahead “The most important objective is to get motorists to respect and not harass cyclists and walkers in 2019. We are working on visual aids, social media material, and screenings to get the message across. We are in the process of designing stickers emblazoned with ‘I respect cyclists’ and putting it on auto rickshaws. As they spread this message, they themselves will become aware of their actions. It is common for motorists to threaten and harass cyclists in Bengaluru and I also experienced an incident where I was almost killed,” says Sathya, who has also co-founded two NGOs Citizens for Sustainability and Praja RAAG. BBMP is supposed to construct 72 km of new cycle tracks, but the plan is stuck due to lack of funds. However, there are a few cycle tracks in place. Public bike sharing isthriving with app-based dockless Yulu Bikes and Mobycy, though Pedl has temporarily stopped its service to work on the quality of its bikes. Directorate of Urban Land Transport was also supposed to launch Namma Trin-Trin bicycles at 40 metro stations in October this year.|0|
‘The car, for me, was a necessity’|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|My first car was a second-hand Padmini Standard that I bought for Rs. 25,000 in 1985. It was a lot of money for me. The Padmini Standard was one of those small cars which was very popular during that time. However, I never drove the car and still don’t drive one. I was compelled to buy the car to use it for my commute to work. This was the time I was shooting for the popular serialKhandaanfor Doordarshan (DD). Earlier, I would take a bus or train to get to work, but when my popularity as an actress grew, taking public transport to the studio became difficult. Our pay then was Rs. 1,000 per episode, since it was a weekly episode. I made Rs. 4,000 every month fromKhandaan. I pooled all the money I had and went looking for a car. Since I was desperate for one, I wasn’t even looking at any particular colour. My goal was to buy one that fit my budget. Finally, I found a green Padmini Standard and purchased it immediately. I remember being excited to go on the test-drive. I was driven to the place where the Worli Sea Link turn is now. For some reason, that drive is still clear in my memory, and even now, when I take a ride on the Worli Sea Link route, I feel extremely nostalgic. It brings back memories of my young days as an actor. The car, for me, was a necessity. Even though I didn’t get the time or have the means to go out more often, as youngsters these days do, I felt content getting driven to and from home for work. My ultimate luxury and happiness was that I was able to take my own home-cooked food in mydabbas,keep it in the car and eat itbilkul aram se(comfortably). The car remained with me for a long time and the person who drove the car was a very good driver. The car made me comfortable about going for shoots in different locations. It was a sense of independence for me. I didn’t have to wait for anyone to drop me nor did I have to depend on anyone to pick me up for any outing. I sometimes wonder where the car is or whether any part of that car still exists. Mechanically, it must have not have had any problem, because the driver never complained or maybe he was kind enough not to. Even today I don’t drive, I don’t even have a licence. Recently, I bought a Toyota Camry and I am happy with the car. I think I don’t complain much about cars because I don’t drive. As told to Prabalika M Borah  The car also made me comfortable about going for shoots in different locations|0|

Hormazd Sorabjee,|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The first time Ihad an accident It was on the 1986 Himalayan Rally. My co-driver Jangoo Nicholson and I took part in a Maruti Gypsy. We were the ‘youngest and the oldest’ team, as I was then 22 years old and he was 72! Jangoo (who footed the bill for the entire event) would take the ceremonial flag off everyday and would give me the wheel in the competitive sections. I was pushing hard — a bit too hard on one of the night stages near Almora — and flipped the Gypsy, which ended up upside down against the mountain side (and thankfully not in the valley below). Jangoo was sleeping and he woke up with a shock, hanging upside down like a bat! Our roll cage and four-point safety harness had done its job and luckily the only thing bruised was my ego.

He bought a mountain bike and began exploring areas nearby. As Arshel followed the circuit closely, especially various cycling groups on social media, he felt motivated to take it up intensely and launched ‘Pedal for a change’ on Facebook. His regular posts about the benefits of cycling, popular cycling routes, what bicycles to buy and profiles of interesting cyclists in the city impressed BYCS. Efforts as Bicycle Mayor “I am working towards changing perceptions of people towards the cycle, which is essentially seen as the poor man’s transport. Also, there are concerns like lack of dedicated lanes and PBS, but I feel unless and until more people take up cycling, these issues won’t be addressed, so I am pushing for as many people as possible to take up cycling,” says Arshel.Arshel is visiting schools, colleges in Guwahati, to promote cycling and feels ever since he became the bicycle mayor, his reach has expanded. “People have become approachable. The government officials give me a patient hearing,” states Arshel, who is also part of Guwahati Cycling Community, which is reportedly the largest cycling group in the Northeast.

Yogendra Pratap,|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The first time Idrove a vintage car My friend once bought a car for €100, from the widow of its first owner, for whom it was his most prized possession. The car was about the same vintage as I am, and of course I wanted to drive it. So without giving it a second thought, we decided to do an inter-continental drive with it to the capital of Georgia, Tbilisi, and while at it, we also decided to set a non-stop driving record with it! The car was a VAZ-2101 Zhiguli, known behind the iron curtain as the Kopeyka. So in the autumn of 2012, we set out right after the Paris Motor Show. The car was old but it came with its own workshop neatly laid out in its boot, the problem being that we knew nothing about fixing a Zhiguli. Luckily our route took us through eastern Europe, where everyone’s father had owned one and knew how to repair it. When the car broke down, it was quickly repaired, and depending on where it broke down, we had experts working on the car in minutes. When it broke down outside a school in Slovakia, we had the headmaster fixing it; when it broke down in front of a fire station in Bulgaria, we had a fire-engine-load of firemen repairing it; and when it broke down on the Turkish-border, we pushed it down the slope into Georgia, where the immigration officer at the border check-post wanted to leave his cubicle to get the car started again. We did set the record for non-stop driving from Vilnius to Tbilisi, and we did it in a nearly half-a-century-old Lada. Editor,Auto Today|0|

Kollywood: What lies ahead|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|If 2018 was a year of change for Kollywood, 2019 promises to see faster transformation in terms of film production and marketing . The superstars will continue to dominate the trade, expanding the market outside Tamil Nadu. One of the most significant trends of 2018 was the growth of Tamil films in the domestic market (excluding Tamil Nadu). Today, major Kannada and Malayalam producers have turned distributors for Tamil films in their home state. They find it more lucrative than making films in their own languages. A point to be noted is that the Hindi dubbed version of Rajinikanth’s2.0grossed more than the Tamil version — a feat that hasn’t happened before! The southern states of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala are becoming a bigger markets for certain Tamil stars. A few years back, 90% of the revenue for a big film came from Tamil Nadu. But today, the other states revenue for a Rajinikanth or a Vijay’s film is as high as 40% of the total sale of theatrical and other rights. Crossing boundaries The overseas market is expanding to newer horizons. In the US,2.0’s theatrical revenue matched some of the big Bollywood films. Tamil films are now releasing in places like Poland, Russia and Ukraine. There are so many new players who are willing to pay extra bucks for the big hero films. In a year, the market value of a star’s film has almost doubled in the overseas . However, Tamil films are yet to crack the Chinese market. . Will2.0manage to rake in moolah in China when it releases in May 2019? China is all set to become the world’s biggest film market by 2021, overtaking the US, though it has its its restrictions (only 34 foreign films a year). A few Bollywood films likeDangal,Secret Superstar,Bajrangi BhaijaanandHindi Mediumdid extraordinary business there. However, it witnessed a decline after recent failures likePadmanandThugs Of Hindostan. The buzz is that2.0is likely to do decent business, considering howTransformers: The Last Knightdid extraordinary numbers in China. But China remains the last frontier for Tamil films, withMersalyet to be released. The South Indian films that had larger-than-life characters (theBaahubaliseries also received lukewarm response) are yet to find acceptance among the Chinese masses. Winds of change What kind of content will Tamil cinema offer in 2019? Yes, there will be more films catering to multiplex audience since women-centric films have scored big last year. Rural-based stories have lost their charm outside the state. Still, you may find a lot of caste-based themes in 2019. The rural entertainers laced with a strong message likeKadaikutty Singamwill continue to draw audiences in the B and C centres. Now, the big question is: what’s the case with smaller films featuring lesser known actors? Producing a Tamil film is no longer easy, as finance has dried up and television channels have stopped buying small films (Jyotika’sKaatrin Mozhisatellite rights are yet to be sold). In addition, the Tamil Film Producers’ Council has disbanded its release regulation committee and it’s free for all. Leading producer G Dhananjayan said, “In 2018, 95 small budget films (less than Rs. 3 crore budget) were released, out of which onlyMerku Thodarchi Malaiworked critically and commercially. Most of the other films did not recover even the publicity expenses. Films made in the Rs. 3-5 crore category, only five films such asIruttu Araiyil Muruttu Kuthu, Pyar Prema Kadhal, Pariyerum Perumal, U TurnandThuppakki Munaiworked commercially. It clearly indicates that small films have very limited opportunity to succeed and the future looks bleak.” Currently, the hot topic in Kollywood is the clash betweenPettaandViswasamthis Pongal. According to the trade, the release dates for the next three months have been locked by influential producers and distributors. Unlike previous years, the multiplexes will now call the shots. Producers are now migrating to OTT platforms, which are gaining momentum. 2019, in many ways, is going to be a landmark year as the production and business of Tamil films are going through a metamorphosis. Nevertheless, the show must go on.|0|

The first time I…|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The first time Iwitnessed how car-crazy Italians really are I’ve heard about car-mad Italians heading to Fiorano just to be able to stand outside Ferrari’s test track and watch through the cracks on the walls while the supercar maker’s drivers tested their latest cars. But to witness first-hand how passionate they are was a different experience all together. I was in Maranello, Italy, to test-drive the 458 Italia; it was just a few days since the convertible had been launched. Getting on to the highway near Ferrari’s wind tunnel facility was easy in the morning and I was taking the opportunity to drive top-down despite the nip in the air. Surprisingly, I kept hearing a lot of honking, something that is very rare on European roads. It was only after a truck driver from two lanes away honked and waved to me that I realised that they were all appreciating the car. All through the day while I drove, other cars would pull close and passengers would stick their heads out to shout ‘Bellissimo’ (handsome; alas not me!). At the lunch and coffee stops, random people came up to see the car and strike up a conversation, including a few cops. Heading back to the hotel in the evening, I was accosted by a couple of drivers in Lamborghinis who sandwiched me in between and wanted me to race them. That one sweeping, windy stretch of the highway was reverberating with the angry exhaust notes of three super cars.  Consulting Motoring Editor,The Hindu BusinessLine|0|

Hormazd Sorabjee,|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The first time Ihad an accident It was on the 1986 Himalayan Rally. My co-driver Jangoo Nicholson and I took part in a Maruti Gypsy. We were the ‘youngest and the oldest’ team, as I was then 22 years old and he was 72! Jangoo (who footed the bill for the entire event) would take the ceremonial flag off everyday and would give me the wheel in the competitive sections. I was pushing hard — a bit too hard on one of the night stages near Almora — and flipped the Gypsy, which ended up upside down against the mountain side (and thankfully not in the valley below). Jangoo was sleeping and he woke up with a shock, hanging upside down like a bat! Our roll cage and four-point safety harness had done its job and luckily the only thing bruised was my ego.

Rahul, Jaitley spar over Rafale|NEW DELHI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|On the first working day of 2019, the Lok Sabha on Wednesday witnessed an intense battle between Congress president Rahul Gandhi and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley over the Rafale fighter aircraft deal. Mr. Gandhi accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of “hiding in his room as he doesn’t have the guts to confront questions” and repeated his party’s demand for a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) to probe the Rafale deal. At a press conference later, Mr. Gandhi dared Prime Minister Modi for a one-on-one debate on the facts of the Rafale deal and claimed that the Finance Minister by stating the size of the deal to be Rs. 58,000 crore has already indicated their price. “If you divide Rs. 58,000 by 36 planes, you get Rs. 1600 crore [Rs. 1611.11 crore],” he told reporters. BJP ally Shiv Sena embarrassed the government in joining the Opposition ranks in demanding a JPC to probe the deal. Rejecting the demand for a JPC probe, the Finance Minister accused Mr. Gandhi of ‘peddling repeated lies’ and claimed that the Congress chief didn’t understand the basics of a combat aircraft. He quoted the Supreme Court judgment to argue that even though the “conscience” of the court was satisfied it did not satisfy the Congress party’s election necessity.|0|
‘The car, for me, was a necessity’|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|My first car was a second-hand Padmini Standard that I bought for Rs. 25,000 in 1985. It was a lot of money for me. The Padmini Standard was one of those small cars which was very popular during that time. However, I never drove the car and still don’t drive one. I was compelled to buy the car to use it for my commute to work. This was the time I was shooting for the popular serialKhandaanfor Doordarshan (DD). Earlier, I would take a bus or train to get to work, but when my popularity as an actress grew, taking public transport to the studio became difficult. Our pay then was Rs. 1,000 per episode, since it was a weekly episode. I made Rs. 4,000 every month fromKhandaan. I pooled all the money I had and went looking for a car. Since I was desperate for one, I wasn’t even looking at any particular colour. My goal was to buy one that fit my budget. Finally, I found a green Padmini Standard and purchased it immediately. I remember being excited to go on the test-drive. I was driven to the place where the Worli Sea Link turn is now. For some reason, that drive is still clear in my memory, and even now, when I take a ride on the Worli Sea Link route, I feel extremely nostalgic. It brings back memories of my young days as an actor. The car, for me, was a necessity. Even though I didn’t get the time or have the means to go out more often, as youngsters these days do, I felt content getting driven to and from home for work. My ultimate luxury and happiness was that I was able to take my own home-cooked food in mydabbas,keep it in the car and eat itbilkul aram se(comfortably). The car remained with me for a long time and the person who drove the car was a very good driver. The car made me comfortable about going for shoots in different locations. It was a sense of independence for me. I didn’t have to wait for anyone to drop me nor did I have to depend on anyone to pick me up for any outing. I sometimes wonder where the car is or whether any part of that car still exists. Mechanically, it must have not have had any problem, because the driver never complained or maybe he was kind enough not to. Even today I don’t drive, I don’t even have a licence. Recently, I bought a Toyota Camry and I am happy with the car. I think I don’t complain much about cars because I don’t drive. As told to Prabalika M Borah  The car also made me comfortable about going for shoots in different locations|0|

KSOU mops up Rs. 53 lakh from B.Ed applications|MYSURU|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Karnataka State Open University (KSOU), which is making efforts to regain its foothold after remaining quiescent for over three years, has managed to collect a whopping Rs. 53 lakh by distributing applications for the B.Ed course. Already, 5,300 students have applied for the course for which the UGC gave its recognition recently and the university issued a notification in November last year seeking applications. With the UGC extending the last date for submitting applications till February 3, the KSOU was hoping to attract more candidates to the two-year course, which is said to be in big demand. The intake is 500 and the applicants have to clear the written test on February 10. December 31 was the last date for submitting applications for B.Ed, MBA and other courses. The entrance test for B.Ed was earlier scheduled on January 6. It is for the first time that the KSOU has launched online admissions so that students need not visit the campus to pay the fees and complete other formalities. “B.Ed is in demand as it is essential to teach in schools. Also, the course is made mandatory for those wishing to join PU colleges as lecturers,” said Vice-Chancellor D. Shivalingaiah. The application fee is Rs. 1,000 per student. “We are expecting 5,000 more applications by January-end,” he said, adding that the course at KSOU is meant only for in-service candidates as per the guidelines of National Council for Teacher Education.

Back to the future|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|"An exhibition marking Ashok Leyland’s 70th anniversary last year featured two restored Austins: an A40 Devon that the company assembled and sold in India; an Austin A40 Somerset, standing amidst symbols of electric-vehicle (EV) technology. The shell of the car was all Somerset, but its soul had been recast with this technology, an exercise that signifed a convergence of the past and the future. Titled ‘Back To The Future’, it describes the place EVs are beginning to reclaim. Yes, reclaim. Let me illustrate. In 2014, Formula E emerged as a new form of motor racing, one driven entirely by EV technology. The championship has the official mark of the Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile and the technology has been improving rapidly over the years. As the 2018-2019 season is underway, we see a Gen 2 electric racing car scorch the tarmac. If you compared the specs of the Gen 1 and Gen 2 race cars, you’ll see the tech spikes. The new Formula E electric race car has more zip, and with a new battery, greater ‘staying power’. Reportedly twice as powerful as the previous one, the battery can now last the entire course of a race. The competition has also been getting fiercer. According to information posted at ABB Formula-E’s official website fiaformulae.com, the sixth season (2019-2020) will get more intense, with one more heavyweight, Mercedes-Benz, joining the fray. Our own Mahindra Racing, the motor racing wing of the Mahindra Group, is one of the teams in the Formula E series. Now, let us rewind to the early 1900s, and zoom in on the race tracks of those days. Any analysis of racing seasons back then will have three sections: automobiles with engines running on gasoline (a North American term for petrol), steam-powered automobiles, and electric automobiles. In an account of a racing season published in its edition dated January 30, 1904,Scientific American, a weekly, treats track records of electric automobiles and those involving gasoline-run automobiles, with an almost equal importance. The listed track records are quite revealing. For example, “the Baker electric torpedo"", which seems to be quite a popular electric racecar of those times, wins the 10-mile race in 17 minutes and 58 seconds. And, in their categories, two cars running on gasoline, are listed as having completed 10 miles in the nine to 10 minutes range. Contrary to what we may assume, EVs continued to be present, if only on the periphery, despite gasoline-run vehicles gaining rapidly in popularity as a result of more refined engines. The impressive success achieved by Detroit Electric illustrates this. Anderson Electric Car Company made an electric car titled Detroit Electric that was in production from 1907 to 1939. Though tortoise-fast, this electric car seemed to impress automobile-loving Americans with how much ground it could cover on a charge. It is said to have scored high on manoeuvrability . One of the Americans sold on the Detroit Electric was Clara Ford, the wife of the man who brought the three ‘A’s together — automobiles, affordability, and the American Dream. Henry Ford’s wife’s attachment to the Detroit Electric car is part of automobile lore. You may read about it at thehenryford.org, and see it at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, where a 1914 Detroit Electric Model 47 Brougham, owned by Clara, is on display. In 2008, the Detroit Electric brand was revived, and eight years later, an electric performance car called Detroit Electric SP.01 was made. And 2018 showed that in certain pockets of the world, especially China and the UK, EV goals are being pursued with great intensity. In October, the Dundee City Council from the United Kingdom received the title ‘Europe’s most visionary electric vehicle city’ from the World Electric Vehicle Association, for ensuring that two-fifth of its fleet consists of EVs and for creating an ecosystem encouraging people to opt for them. Another sign that we are accelerating towards this future is Lamborghini taking the wraps off the Terzo Millennio, an electric concept car produced in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  A charged past In 1901, Thomas Edison made a Nickel-Iron battery for Electric Vehicles."|0|

SC dismisses plea to defer HC bifurcation|New Delhi|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to entertain a petition filed by the Andhra Pradesh High Court Advocates’ Association in Hyderabad to defer the implementation of a notification issued on December 26 bifurcating the Hyderabad High Court into the new Andhra Pradesh and Telangana High Courts. A Bench of Justices A.K. Sikri and S. Abdul Nazeer said there would be “initial hiccups” and the High Courts “have already started functioning.” Justice Sikri observed orally that the court had considered every aspect of the matter of bifurcation before asking the government to go ahead with it. The association’s plea was dismissed as withdrawn. The two separate High Courts are functioning from January 1. The petition had urged that the bifurcation be delayed until the new premises for the Andhra Pradesh High Court in the capital city of Amaravati was completed. The High Court will function from temporary premises till the construction work is completed. ‘Judges satisfied’ Andhra Pradesh had already informed the Supreme Court that the judges, who would preside over the courts of the new High Court, were satisfied with the facilities that were created in an interim building complex that would house the High Court till a permanent building was constructed. Senior advocate Fali Nariman for Andhra Pradesh had also made a statement that the government would be providing villas to take care of the residential needs of the judges at Amaravati.|0|
18 earworms of 2018|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|January 02, 2019 00:00 IST|The quality of Bollywood music continued on a downward spiral in 2018 but the multi-composer soundtracks and remixes kept going north. In fact, this was the year that even biggies like A.R. Rahman and Amit Trivedi got sucked into the multi-composer vortex. One little silver lining, though, has been the ease in compiling the top songs for the year. However, if not for some soundtracks bolstering the scene in the second half of 2018 even a reasonable number of picks would have been difficult to make. Here are the 18 that stood out in 2018. Hallaa (Manmarziyaan) Composer Amit Trivedi’s busiest year to date was also a rather middling one for most part, until he reunited with the man who gave him his first break, Anurag Kashyap. While the characteritsic repetitiveness of Trivedi was a problem here too, there was more than enough great music on offer.‘Halla’,written by Shellee, is my pick for the pulsating orchestration, Jyoti Nooran’s rendition and alsofor the moment in the movie when the song appears. Dilbaro (Raazi) The most popular song fromRaaziand quite deservedly so; SEL and Gulzar build a beautiful“bidaai”song around a traditional Kashmiri wedding piece. Harshdeep Kaur takes care of the rest, with brief but effective cameos from Vibha Saraf and Shankar Mahadevan. Bol Ke Lab (Manto) The most exciting aspect about the Nandita Das film, at least to me, was the return of Sneha Khanwalkar, that too in style. In this song, Faiz’s powerful poetry gets a raag yaman-flavoured melody from the composer. She has two classical exponents — Rashid Khan and Vidya Shah — singing it and adorns it with a rich backdrop of strings, harmonium and clarinets. Aaj Se Teri (Pad Man) Among singers, Arijit Singh had the best year; as if in contradicting the (misplaced) criticism that he sings the same kind of songs. My favourite from the Arijit range is this beauty by Amit Trivedi and Kausar Munir, based on raag bhimplaasi that the composer has employed well in the past too. Naino Waale Ne (Padmaavat) One of the best things about Sanjay Leela Bhansali movies is the visual representation of songs. It was surprising therefore that the best song ofPadmaavatnever even made it to the screen. Neeti Mohan leads this lovely melody that takes on the occasional wistful tone with the raag darbari Kanada flavoured cues on sitar. Bohot Dukha Mann (Mukkabaaz) Composer Rachita Arora, who showed promise in her debut last year (Newton), continued to deliver it. In this melancholic classical-flavoured piece written by Hussain Haidry, she doubles up as a singer alongside Dev Arijit, and does a fabulous job at that. Aahista (Laila Majnu) With this soundtrack co-composed with Joi Barua and Alif, sitar exponent Niladri Kumar had everyone wishing he would make more music in Hindi movies. In this song (written by Irshad Kamil, sung by Jonita Gandhi and Arijit Singh), Kumar literally takes you on a romantic journey across the Kashmir valley. Dhadak (Dhadak) The problem with remakes is that you find yourself hard-pressed not to keep comparing them with the original work. Even taking that into account, the title song ofDhadak(remake of Nagraj Manjule’s Marathi hitSairat) holds up admirably. It is hard not to fall in love with Ajay Atul’s lush violins and haunting tune, delivered by Ajay Gogavle and Shreya Ghoshal. Andhadhun (Andhadhun) While Amit Trivedi produced a competent set of songs for Sriram Raghavan inAndhadhun, my favourite still remains the guest composition by Raftaar and Girish Nakod. The piano and percussion-heavy (always a sucker for Marathi percussion!) title song perfectly captures the heady rush of the ride that the movie turns out to be. Grey Walaa Shade (Manmarziyaan) A song that, in addition to introducing the lead pair’s romance onscreen, turns out to be emblematic of the movie itself. It is replete with Amit Trivedi’s trademark quirkiness, further accentuated by the dancing twins that appear in the song’s video. Nagri Nagri (Manto) Shankar Mahadevan delivers this piece that, in keeping with the movie’s setting, carries a melody and a style of rendition that is evocative of the ’40s. Composer Sneha Khanwalkar does, however, by her own admission, get cheeky with the arrangement with some electronic elements finding their way towards the end. That does not in any way take away from the song’s appeal. Chaav Laga (Sui Dhaaga) The team that gave us ‘Moh Moh Ke Dhaage’ (Dum Lagaa Ke Haishaa) two years back reunited inSui Dhaagato deliver another simple yet beautiful piece, the wonderful Ronkini Gupta being the only addition on the vocal front this time. Mere Naam Tu (Zero) While the reviews of the movie have been mixed, what everyone appears to agree on is how well this song has been depicted on screen. An incredible melody backed by Ajay Atul’s trademark sweeping orchestration and a fabulous Bollywood playback debut for Abhay Jodhpurkar. Naina Banjaare (Pataakha) Vishal Bhardwaj-Gulzar soundtrack for the movie was an uncharacteristically short one and not as top notch as their previous albums. In this song the duo gets everything right, with ample help from Arijit of course. A gem that in its light-heartedness takes my mind back to‘Dil Toh Bachcha Hai Ji’fromIshqiya. Mujhe Chaand Pe Le Chalo (Sanju) A.R. Rahman was more active in the South this year, his two songs forSanju’ssix-song soundtrack being the only Bollywood contributions. The shoddy visual treatment the song received might have something to do with it not becoming particularly popular, but there is no denying the brilliance of this dreamy, sensual piece written by Irshad Kamil sung with a fitting verve by Nikhita Gandhi. Raazi (Raazi) SEL have given us a lot of anthemic pieces over time; in Meghna Gulzar’sRaazi, the trio alongside Gulzar and Arijit Singh, channel their soundscape fromMirzyato produce this wonderfully earthy motivational piece.  Ishq Di Baajiyaan(Soorma) Soorma’s music may not sit too well in the combined portfolio of SEL and Gulzar but is still quite an enjoyable one; this folksy piece (where Diljit Dosanjh gets behind the mic) mostly so.  Heartquake (Karwaan) Composer Anurag Saikia’s promising entry into mainstream Bollywood went largely under the radar, possibly because all the movies he has been involved in so far were multi-composer. Two of those came from director Akarsh Khurana, and it is in this light and quirky track written by Khurana himself, that Saikia delivers his best of the year.|0|
T.N. to give Rs. 1,000 as Pongal gift|CHENNAI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Taking populism to the next level in an election year, the AIADMK government on Wednesday announced that over two crore families with ration cards in the State would each get Rs. 1,000 in cash as a Pongal gift. The largese, “to celebrate Pongal festival, mitigate the impact of Cyclone Gaja in the Cauvery delta and the widespread drought in northern districts”, would cost the exchequer over Rs. 2,000 crore and push the overall food subsidy to Rs. 8,000 crore this year. Already over 1.84 crore ration card holders get free rice, officials said. Governor Banwarilal Purohit made the announcement in his customary address to the first Assembly session of the year. He said the State government would give a cash support of Rs. 1,000 to every family with a ration card. Gift hamper Officials clarified that all cardholders, not just rice cardholders, would get the gift. The government had distributed Aadhaar-linked smart cards to 2.01 crore families, they added. The cash incentive is over and above the usual Pongal hamper to all ration cardholders in the State. The gift hamper contains raw rice, sugar, raisins, cashewnuts, cardamom and sugarcane. The distribution of cash support would not happen in Tiruvarur district, as the Model Code of Conduct was in force there.|0|

Only truth can defeat tsunami of lies spread by A.P. govt.: Modi|VIJAYAWADA|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday accused the State government of pushing the blame for its failures on to the Central government and claimed that it did a lot for the State. He said he had only postponed his visit scheduled for this month and when he comes, he would expose the “opportunistic politics” played by the TDP dispensation. Addressing booth-level party workers in Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam, Kakinada, Narsapuram and Machilipatnam Lok Sabha constituencies through a video-conference from New Delhi, Mr. Modi said the BJP had contributed to the development of A.P. and insisted that “truth, truth and only truth can defeat the tsunami of lies spread by the State government”. He claimed that the Centre had released Rs. 20,000 crore as resource gap and revenue deficit funding and wondered into whose pocket had the money gone if the State did not receive it. He reiterated the Central government’s commitment to the welfare of the people of the State. Mr. Modi said the people were angry with the political leadership in A.P. and were looking for a change. They had not forgotten how the Congress had bifurcated the State but the BJP had always stood by it, he asserted. The PM said he would speak to party workers in other constituencies on Jan 6 and exhorted the cadres to list out the Central government’s achievements with pride.|0|
Allow Sabarimala temple to follow its own rules: seer|UDUPI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Vidyadheesha Tirtha Swami of Paryaya Palimar Mutt said on Wednesday that religion had its own protocols which should be respected with regard to the entry of women at the Ayyappa Swami Temple at Sabarimala in Kerala. Speaking to presspersons here, the Palimar seer said that anyhow there was no blanket ban on the entry of women to Sabarimala temple. Only women having menstrual cycles had been barred from entering the temple. “We have a Constitution and there are administrative protocols. So too religion has its own protocols. Both have to be respected,” he said. To a query, the seer said that he did not want to comment on the Supreme Court’s verdict on the issue or question it. Already, an appeal had been filed against this verdict. “But there was no problem for so many years as all had accepted the arrangement at the temple. So why question it [the religious practice] now? I feel it is better to allow the rules that the temple has been following to prevail instead of creating a needless controversy about it. People should enter temples with devotion and not by compulsion,” the seer said.|0|
Two women make it to Sabarimala|THIRUVANANTHAPURAM|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Two young women entered the Sabarimala Ayyappa temple in Kerala under police cover in the early hours of Wednesday, triggering anti-government protests across the State. The women in their 40s — Bindu from Kozhikode and Kanakadurga from Malappuram — reached the foothills around 1.30 a.m. at Pampa, from where they were escorted to the temple by plainclothes policemen. This is the first time that women in the 10-50 age group have managed to enter the temple following the Supreme Court verdict of September 28. Protesters owing allegiance to the Sangh Parivar and Bharatiya Janata Party took to the streets, blocked roads, threw stones and clashed with the police, leading to tense situations at several places. The Sabarimala Karma Samithi has called for a Statewide dawn-to-dusk hartal on Thursday. CM confirms darshan Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan later confirmed the entry of the two women. “Yes, they have had darshan.” The temple chief priest, Kandararu Rajeevararu, closed the sanctum sanctorum at 10.35 a.m. to perform ‘purification’ rites in the wake of the official confirmation of the entry of the two young women. The temple reopened after the hour-long rites. Both the Congress-led United Democratic Front and the BJP came out against the government, accusing it of “masterminding” the operation and “hurting” the religious sentiments of Ayyappa devotees. Alleging that the government was behind the “violation of the temple traditions”, the BJP announced that it would support the hartal on Thursday. The Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee too has decided to observe a ‘black day’ on Thursday, protesting against the government for allegedly violating the ritualistic practices at Sabarimala and “hurting religious sentiments.” ‘Without consent’ Taking strong exception to the Tantri’s decision to close the temple, Travancore Devaswom Board president A. Padmakumar said the purification rituals were held without obtaining the board’s consent. Left Democratic Front leaders including Communist Party of India (Marxist) State Secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan said the Tantri’s decision was a violation of the court verdict allowing women of all age groups to enter the temple. The Tantri said the rites were required as “tradition was violated.” The darshan came a day after the government-supported ‘women’s wall’ campaign.|0|
Ramesh Jarkiholi returns to Gokak only to leave|Belagavi|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The former Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi, who is said to be upset over being dropped from the Cabinet, returned to Gokak on Tuesday. He arrived with his son Amarnath and met other family members at his house. He left home on Wednesday morning. He must have left for Bengaluru, said a party worker from Gokak. He did not speak to any party workers, sources close to him said. He was on tour for the last week and was said to be out of reach of the Congress leaders. His younger brother and Forest Minister Satish Jarkiholi told presspersons in Belagavi on Wednesday that his efforts to meet his brother had not been successful yet. “But I will meet him in one or two days,” he said. “All these days, I have maintained that he will not resign from the Congress. Even now I say that. He will stay in the Congress and work with us for our success in the Lok Sabha polls. But in case he resigns, it will have nothing to do with us. My brothers and I will continue to stay in the Congress,” Mr. Satish Jarkiholi said.|0|
Celebratory firing: former MLA detained|NEW DELHI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Delhi police on Wednesday detained former Bihar MLA Raju Singh and his driver-cum-bodyguard Hari Singh from Uttar Pradesh’s Gorakhpur in connection with the celebratory firing that left a 42-year-old architect battling for life. The victim, Archana Gupta, who received a bullet injury in the head and was put on life support on Tuesday, has been declared brain-dead, police said. DCP (South) Vijay Kumar said that the accused were on their way to Bihar when they were detained. “Information was shared with the U.P. police and they stopped the duo in Kushinagar. Our team then rushed to the place and detained them. They are being brought to Delhi,” he said. The victim and her husband Vikas Gupta, a builder by profession, had gone to attend the New Year’s Eve party at the former legislator’s farmhouse in Fatehpur Beri, Delhi. Around 60 people were present when Archana was hit by a stray bullet. Mr. Gupta told police that Mr. Raju Singh fired about five-six rounds in the air, one of the bullets hitting the victim. His bodyguard was allegedly firing gunshots too. The duo, after the incident, cleaned up the farm and fled the spot, the officer said. The JD(U) clarified on Wednesday that he had quit the party in 2014.|0|
Metro captains shake a leg to a new track|KOCHI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The informal video is rather unusual for a government-run organisation, what with even the managing director, directors, managers, administrative staff, and depot workers shaking a leg to thank patrons and to ring in the New Year. But the video posted on the Facebook page of the Kochi metro has already become a hit. It is candid, as not many knew at the time of shooting that it would be part of an official promo, said Anoop Mohan, assistant manager, signalling and telecommunication department, Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL). “It has come out well and has covered a cross-section of employees. It also reflects on the good work culture at the metro,” he added. And sure, the metro has a reason to celebrate. “After all, it was the sole mode of transport that could be relied on along the national highway and many parts of the Greater Kochi area when floods lashed the State. We turned Good Samaritans by operating trains free of cost for people desperate to move to safer areas and for volunteers to transport food and other items,” said KMRL managing director A.P.M. Mohammed Hanish, who is seen grooving to the rhythm of the musical video. Daily footfall on the metro touched 50,000 during the season. “It will further increase when the 5.5-km extension up to Thykoodam is realised in June. The commissioning of the Champakkara bridge will follow suit,” he added. Phase II work The agency, Mr. Hanish said, was expected to start work on the second phase of the Vyttila Mobility Hub whose DPR had been approved by the VMH Society’s executive committee. “The governing body chaired by the Chief Minister has to ratify it now. We also helped install GPS in 900 private buses, while e-buses as the metro’s feeder service are expected to be rolled out once the UMTA Act is passed. e-autos too will be introduced in the metro corridor,” he added.|0|

The government agreed to give in-principle approval for the Detailed Project Report (DPR) for the project immediately, with the understanding that contentious issues can be sorted out at the stage of detailed design. The SWR had submitted the draft DPR to the State government on December 4, 2018. A high-level meeting of the SWR and the Karnataka government, led by Chief Secretary T.M. Vijay Bhaskar, approved the four corridors totalling to a length of 160.5 km at a cost of Rs. 19,499 crore, as per RITES report. The four corridors to be taken up are: Kengeri – Whitefield (35.47 km), KSR Bengaluru – Rajanukunte (24.88 km), Nelamangala – Byappanahalli (38.94 km) and Heelalige – Devanahalli (61.21 km). The State government still can suggest prioritising corridors along with extensions. “The DPR has been pending for State government’s comments for nearly a month. To get it cleared, the SWR got this meeting scheduled. A major outcome of the meeting is agreement to finalise the DPR first, for which the SWR even offered land free of cost,” said a senior SWR official.|0|
‘Modi’s remarks do not behove his stature’|VIJAYAWADA|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi observed that Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu was in anger, the latter took on him saying Mr. Modi’s comments do not match his stature. “In fact, the Prime Minister is envious of Andhra Pradesh as he fears that AP would surpass Gujarat. He has shown his jealousy by not releasing funds and creating hurdles in the development of A.P.,” Mr Naidu said. The Chief Minister said that Mr. Modi could do nothing for Ahmedabad during his tenure as Chief Minister of Gujara, he said. Mr. Naidu was addressing a teleconference with party leaders on Wednesday. The BJP’s strength in south India is zero. Despite the campaign by three Chief Ministers, 13 Union ministers, BJP national president Amit Shah and the Prime Minister, the BJP could win only one seat in the Telangana Assembly elections, he observed. ‘Unholy nexus’ The TDP was fighting against “three Modis” — Mr. Narendra Modi, YSR Congress Party president Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, and Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao. All three were spewing venom against A.P. He said the general elections were approaching fast. It was the need of the hour that the TDP retains the power to meet the aspirations of the people and for the development of the State. “Our target is to win 25 MP seats and 150 Assembly seats,” the TDP supremo asserted.|0|
TNPCB rejects Vedanta’s request|CHENNAI/NEW DELHI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) has rejected Vedanta Ltd.’s request for renewal of consent to operate the Sterlite Copper smelter at Thoothukudi. Citing an appeal filed by it and the State government in the Supreme Court on Wednesday against the National Green Tribunal’s (NGT) order in the matter, the Board rejected Vedanta’s request. The company had written to the TNPCB seeking renewal of consent to operate the unit under the Water Act, Air Act and the Hazardous Wastes Rules, as well as opening of the seal of the premises, restoration of power supply and provision of immediate access to the plant for carrying out urgent maintenance. Last month, the NGT had set aside Tamil Nadu’s order to close the plant. ‘Not based on data’ In its appeal, filed in the Supreme Court, the State said the NGT had failed to consider the entire gamut of data, documents and evidence placed on record in the case to show that the smelter had “irreversibly polluted the groundwater in and around the Thoothukudi district”. The tribunal, on December 15, asked the TNPCB to pass fresh orders of renewal of consent and authorisation to Vedanta to handle hazardous substances.|0|
Two, including minor, lynched in Bihar|PATNA|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Two persons, including a minor, were lynched by a mob on Wednesday in Nalanda district of Bihar on suspicion of being involved in the killing of a local Rashtriya Janata Dal leader. A member of RJD’s SC/ST cell Indal Paswan of Maghra village under Deep Nagar police station of Nalanda district was killed on Tuesday night. “Indal Paswan had a shop selling construction material and he had a heated argument with someone on Tuesday evening... he was shot dead when he was returning home from a funeral,” Deep Nagar Police station in-charge Dharmendra Kumar said. The RJD leader’s killing triggered a massive outrage among locals and his supporters, who staged a protest at the district headquarters Biharsharief and shouted slogan against the Nitish Kumar government. Nalanda is the home district of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. Later, the protesting mob attacked the house of two suspects Raj Kumar Malakar, 40 and Ranjan Kumar, 15, and beat them up.

Bill to allow voluntary use of Aadhaar ID introduced|New Delhi|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The government on Wednesday introduced a Bill in the Lok Sabha that will allow individuals to voluntarily offer biometric ID Aadhaar as a means of identity verification for obtaining services like opening a bank account and getting a mobile phone connection. The Bill, which seeks to amend three separate laws governing Aadhaar, the telecom sector and banking regulation, gives a minor an option to opt out of the 12-digit identity scheme on attaining the age of 18 years. It also provides for stiff penalties for violation of norms.

Air hostess, friends molested, phone snatched on New Year’s Eve|New Delhi|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|A 28-year-old air hostess and her two female friends were allegedly molested and her husband and a male friend were thrashed by about a dozen men when the five had gone to celebrate New Year’s Eve in Hauz Khas. The woman’s husband, a consultant with a firm in Gurugram, toldThe Hinduthat they had stepped out of a café at Sri Aurobindo Marg around 1.30 a.m. and were waiting for a cab when the incident happened. “Initially, two boys passed lewd comments at my wife and her friends. I told them to leave us alone and an argument ensued,” the 28-year-old consultant said. The victims spotted two police officers and told them about the boys. “The officers slapped the duo. While leaving, they threatened us with dire consequences,” he said. About 10 minutes later, the duo came back with about 10 others and started thrashing them. They beat up the consultant, groped his wife and her friends and threatened them with rape. “My wife has an injury on her upper body. She and her friends are still in shock,” the consultant said, adding that the attackers, who were drunk, also snatched his wife’s mobile phone. He claimed that the attack continued for 10-15 minutes and there were about 100-150 people on the street but no one helped them. “They were instead making videos,” he said, adding that a female friend managed to escape and called police. “The police helped us get a cab and we left for home. All the attackers had fled by then.” On Tuesday morning, the couple lodged a complaint at Hauz Khas police station. The FIR was registered on Wednesday and a medical examination was conducted. A case under Sections 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 506 (criminal intimidation), 379 (theft), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 34 (common intention) of IPC has been registered but no arrests have been made so far.|0|
Invasive mussel in Kochi backwaters|Kochi|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|From clambering lantana plants tokarimeen-like red-bellied paku, invasive species come in all sizes. The latest addition to Kerala’s invasives list is only around a centimetre or two long: scientists have confirmed the presence of the invasive black-striped musselMytilopsis salleiin Kochi’s backwaters. 'Alien' mussel In a study published on December 25 in the scientific journalCurrent Science, researchers at the Cochin University of Science and Technology (Cusat) used basic genetic methods to confirm the identity of mussels they collected from Cochin harbour and Ezhupunna in Alappuzha. They extracted DNA from these mussels. While running this through an international online database, they matched it to the DNA of mussels observed from the Lam Tsuen River in Hong Kong (China), confirming that it is the same species that is now found in Kochi’s backwaters. The black-striped mussell, native to the South and Central Americas, is an invasive species in most parts of the world. In India, it has been recorded from the ports of Mumbai and Vishakapatnam. It spreads primarily through the discharge of ballast waters of ships. The fast-growing species – which dwells in shallow water – can tolerate a wide variety of environmental conditions (salinity, water temperatures and oxygen levels), which helps them thrive in the new areas they colonise. The researchers estimate that one square metre near Fort Kochi (from where they collected some of the mussel samples) contains as many as 748 individuals. This is extremely high, said Bijoy Nandan, professor at Cusat’s Department of Marine Biology and one of the scientists who conducted the study. Several costs Though tiny, these invasive mussels are ‘biofoulers’: organisms that accumulate on wet surfaces, causing huge ecological and economic losses. They can cause the deterioration of coastal infrastructure. The mussels can displace native species of clams from their coastal habitats and cause a reduction in native biodiversity. Now the mussels can be spotted along most of Kerala’s coastline, said Dr. Nandan.|0|
Hindus cannot wait till eternity for temple: VHP|NEW DELHI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) on Wednesday said “the Hindu society cannot wait till eternity” for the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya, a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement on Tuesday that he would not bring legislation for the temple before the legal process got over. VHP international working president Alok Kumar said here that “considering the overall situation, the VHP continues to be of the firm view that the Hindu society cannot be expected to wait till eternity for a court decision.” “The only appropriate way forward is to enact legislation clearing the way for the construction of a grand Ram temple at the Ram Janmabhoomi now,” he added. He clarified that the VHP did not see attempts to introduce a private member Bill for the construction of a temple in Ayodhya, stating that a “government-sponsored Bill” was what the organisation wanted. “Further steps will be decided by Hindu seers at the Dharam Sansad to be held during the Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj,” he added.|0|
‘M.P. decision on Vande Mataram to please particular community’|New delhi|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Taking a swipe at the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh, BJP chief Amit Shah on Wednesday said ‘Vande Mataram’ was not sung at the State secretariat just to please a ‘particular community’ and asked whether it was done on instructions from party president Rahul Gandhi. In a Facebook post, Mr. Shah alleged that Congress was making Madhya Pradesh, the “heart of Hindustan”, a centre of its “appeasement” policy. ‘Vande Mataram’ was not sung at the State secretariat on Tuesday, the first working day of the month, a tradition followed by the previous BJP government. “Rahul Gandhi should clear his stand before the people of country on the unfortunate decision by the Congress government,” Mr. Shah said. The BJP chief said ‘Vande Mataram’ does not belong to any particular community and instead it is a symbol of the sacrifice of lakhs of warriors who laid down their lives for the freedom of India. “And its insult just to please a particular community is very sad, shameful and disrespect of the country’s freedom,” Mr. Shah said. Earlier in the day, former CM Shivraj Chouhan also attacked the Kamal Nath government and said he and all other BJP MLAs will sing ‘Vande Mataram’ on the first day of the Assembly session.|0|

Share swap ratio for bank merger cleared|Mumbai/New Delhi|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The boards of Bank of Baroda (BoB), Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank, on Wednesday approved the share swap ratio for the proposed merger. Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank shareholders will get 402 and 110 shares of BoB, respectively, for every 1,000 shares held. The Union Cabinet approved the amalgamation of the three banks, with Bank of Baroda as the transferee bank, and Vijaya and Dena as transferor banks. This would mean that the merged entity would be known as the Bank of Baroda. However, bank officials said there would be a new logo of the merged entity to reflect the identity of all the three banks. The merger will come into effect from April 1. “The amalgamation will help create a strong globally competitive bank with economies of scale and enable realisation of wide-ranging synergies,” the Centre said in a statement. The government said every permanent and regular officer or employee of Vijaya and Dena would continue to hold his office or service in the Bank of Baroda. The pay and allowance offered to the staff of Vijaya and Dena would not be less favourable compared to what they would have drawn in their respective banks, it added.|0|

Rajya Sabha calendar charts many milestones|New Delhi|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The 2019 Rajya Sabha calendar, launched by its Chairman and Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu, is a treasure trove of the Upper House’s history. For instance, it says that over 34 of its 66 years of existence, including the first 17 years, the Rajya Sabha did not have a Leader of the Opposition. It was only in December 1969 that the position was first occupied by Shyam Nandan Mishra of the Congress. The office was formally created by an Act in 1977. The longest serving Leader of the Opposition is former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with a tenure of six years. He has the distinction of being the longest-serving Leader of the House, with a stint of 10 years. The calendar, Mr. Naidu said, is a chronicle of political changes in the Rajya Sabha since 1952. Featured in the calendar are 65 leaders, including 13 Chairmen, 12 Deputy Chairpersons (three women among them), 26 Leaders of the House and 14 Leaders of the Opposition, since the inception of the Rajya Sabha in 1952. Six Rajya Sabha Chairmen who have gone onto become the President. The last to make this transition was K.R.

Sabarimala ‘purification’ triggers row|PATHANAMTHITTA/Thiruvananthapuram|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The closing of the Sabarimala temple for purification rituals following the entry of two women of menstruating age on Wednesday has cast the Tantri of the shrine in the spotlight.

Tantri (chief priest) Kandararu Rajeevararu closed the sanctum sanctorum at 10.35 a.m. for performing the purification rites in the wake of the official confirmation on the entry of two young women to the Ayyappa temple. The rites came to a close and darshan was resumed by 11.25 a.m. Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) president A. Padmakumar said the Tantri had performed the rituals without obtaining the board’s consent. However, the Tantri toldThe Hinduthat he had told the TDB president over phone that the purification rites would have to be done. Mr. Rajeevararu said he had discussed the matter with Devaswom executive officer D. Sudheeshkumar, who was present on the occasion. “Being the chief priest, I am duty-bound to follow the ritualistic practices at Sabarimala,” he said. Devaswom Minister Kadakampally Surendran said Mr. Rajeevararu had no legal mandate to close the shrine on his own as per the manual of the TDB. The TDB, a public entity, owned the temple not the Tantri or the former ruling family of Pandalam. Only the TDB could order the closure of the temple. The Tantri was but an employee. “Anyway the Tantri has violated the Supreme Court order and the TDB manual. Let him answer to the apex court,” he said. Chennithala’s stance Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said the State-sponsored entry of women was a trespass against Ayyappa faith. “Non-believers have conspired to destroy faith. The Tantri had acted aptly,” he said. Bharathiya Janata Party (BJP) president P.S. Sreedharan Pillai said the government would face a backlash for “the assault on Hindu faith.” Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), said the Tantri’s decision was “provocative” and tantamount to contempt of the SC. By closing the sanctum sanctorum the Tantri has challenged the verdict that granted unrestricted entry for all women. General secretary of the Nair Service Society G. Sukumaran Nair thanked the Tantri for having closed the temple for purification. Tribal group’s reaction P.K. Sajeev, leader of the Malayaraya Samudayam, a tribal group which has claimed a traditional right to administer Sabarimala, described the closure of the temple as a brazen practice of untouchability. CPI State secretary Kanam Rajendran condemned the Tantri’s action. No atonement rituals had been prescribed in the Supreme Court verdict, he said.|0|
A first for Sabarimala Ayyappa temple|PATHANAMTHITTA|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|This for the first time that purification rites were performed at the Sabarimala Ayyappa temple for the entry of women of child-bearing age to the temple. Talking toThe Hindu, chief priest (Tantri) Kandararu Rajeevararu said the rites were performed in consultation with Devaswom Executive Officer D.Sudheeshkumar and Melsanthi (head priest) V.N. Vasudevan Namboodiri after it was confirmed that the ritualistic practices were violated by two young women. The purification rites included ‘panchapunyahom’, ‘praasada-shudhi’, ‘bimba-shudhi’ etc. Mr. Rajeevararu said he, being the hereditary chief priest, was duty-bound to protect the tantric traditions and practices at Sabarimala that treated entry of women in the menstruating age a violation of custom and practices. “The unique tantric tradition and practices at Sabarimala, where the presiding deity is in the form of a persistent bachelor (Naishtik Brahmachari), seldom permit worship by women in the child-bearing age. It should not be treated as a ban on women’s entry as there is no restriction for children below the age of 10 years and women above the age of 50 years to undertake Sabarimala pilgrimage,” he said. Mr. Rajeevararu said purification rites were being performed as a custom prior to the annual temple festival, Mandalapuja, Makaravilakku festival etc. The shudhi-kriya prior to the Makaravilakku festival would be held on January 12 and 13. For the last five centuries, in almost every temple in Kerala, tantris follow the rituals prescribed in the three trantric texts - Tantra Samucchaya, Sesha Samucchaya and Kuzhikkaatt Paccha, says Akkeeramon Kalidasan Bhattathirippad, patron of the Aluva Tantra Vidya Peedhom. Pandalam Palace managing committee general secretary M.N. Narayana Varma said the Tantri was the last word on matters relating to ritualistic practices at Sabarimala.|0|

Isolate IS supporters, says Mirwaiz|Srinagar|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Hardening his pitch over the bid to unfurl an Islamic State (IS) flag inside the Jamia Masjid here recently, Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq on Wednesday said, “The December 28 incident is highly condemnable act. It has left the entire Valley in a deep shock and hurt their sentiments. It’s time to isolate those elements who are trying to damage and violate the sanctity of the grand masjid. People of J&K should maintain strict vigil.” A group of masked youth tried to unfurl an IS flag atop the pulpit of the Jamia Masjid in Srinagar on December 28. In Srinagar’s old city, which houses the 624-year-old mosque, the Mirwaiz held a meeting at the Mirwaiz Manzil, Razia Kadal, on Wednesday and described the incident as “sacrilegious”. “The December 28 incident is highly condemnable act. It has left the entire valley in a deep shock and hurt their sentiments. It’s time to isolate those elements who are trying to violate the sanctity of the grand masjid. People of J&K should maintain strict vigil,” said the Mirwaiz. He urged the people to stay united on this. “Unity among all sects will not allow these elements to damage our religious and social fabric and ethos,” he added. The participants in the meeting pledged “not to allow any such incidents to happen again”. The Mirwaiz, backed by other separatist leaders, including Syed Ali Geelani and Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, is holding a joint protest at the mosque on Friday. “The old city has always been the epicentre of Kashmir’s spiritual religious quest and its political ideology and the pulpit of Jamia Masjid has represented both. Nobody will be allowed to tamper with the centrality of Jamia Masjid and what it stands for,” the Mirwaiz, who is also the head priest, said. He performed certains rites at the mosque in the wake of the “desecration”. Civilian casualties Meanwhile, Director-General of Police (DGP) Dilbagh Singh on Wednesday said a total of 423 people were killed in 2018, including 252 militants, 91 civilians, 45 policeman, five CRPF jawans and 30 Army soldiers in around 97 operations. “Of 97 operations, 83 witnessed no collateral damage. Out of 91 civilian deaths, 44 were killed by militants and 38 lost their lives near encounter sites,” said DGP Singh in a press conference in Srinagar. The DGP appealed to youth of the Valley to safeguard their precious lives.|1|Friday
Rane audio clip authentic: Rahul|New Delhi/Panaji|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said the audio clip, in which Goa’s Health Minister Vishwajit Rane is heard saying that Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar had all the files on the Rafale deal in his bedroom, is “authentic”. At a press conference in the national capital, Mr. Gandhi said “there might be many other such tapes in circulation even though he didn’t know for sure”. Mr. Rane, however, said in Panaji that the audio clip was ‘doctored’, and Mr. Parrikar never talked about the Rafale deal in any State Cabinet meeting. Mr. Parrikar took to Twitter to deny the charges. “The audio clip released by the Congress party is a desperate attempt to fabricate facts after their lies were exposed by the recent Supreme Court verdict on Rafale. No such discussion ever came up during Cabinet or any other meeting,” said Mr. Parrikar, during whose tenure as Defence Minister the Rafale deal was signed. “Do you think Mr. Parrikar will not deny it? If you were Mr. Vishwajit Rane, would you not deny it?” Mr. Gandhi retorted when told about the Chief Minister’s statement. “The Congress played the tape, the Congress party has made the transcript available. I read part of the transcript and the tape is authentic,” he said. However, he had not said the audio clip was authentic in the Lok Sabha where he wanted to play it. Asked why he did not do so, Mr. Gandhi said: “I asked the Speaker, ‘Can I play the tape?’ The Speaker refused to allow me to play the tape. Had I played the tape, then the question of authenticity arises.” The Congress had released the audio clip and the transcripts of a “conversation” between Mr. Rane and another person, whose identity has been kept confidential. “The Chief Minister makes one interesting statement. That I have all the information of Rafale in my bedroom. He said it’s in my bedroom ... here only in the flat ... Each and every document of Rafale is with me ... that means he is holding them to ransom,” Mr. Rane was heard telling the other person. “The day those files are out, as stated or threatened by Mr. Parrikar, it will prove what we have always said that Rafale is the biggest scam and the person accountable for it is Prime Minister Narendra Modi,’’said Congress communication chief Randeep Singh Surjewala, while playing the audio clip at a press conference. ‘Evidence against PM’ “Modijisays there is no personal allegation against him in the Rafale deal, but this audio is evidence of his culpability which was earlier established by former French President Francois Hollande,” Mr. Surjewala said. He alleged that the Prime Minister did not want a joint parliamentary committee as he did not want the “Rafale secrets to be known even to his party colleagues”. A JPC could find out the truth within 10 days. Mr. Rane, a former Congress leader who switched over to the BJP immediately after Mr. Parrikar won the trust vote in 2017, said he was being used as a pawn in the power game between the ruling and Opposition parties. “The Congress seems to be frustrated in the election year to stoop so low. I have asked Chief Minister Parrikar to take the help of the State police as well as Central agencies to probe the source of the purported audio conversation and how it went viral,” he said.

India records 377 mine deaths in 3 years|Kolkata|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|At a time when multiple agencies are involved in the rescue of 15 miners trapped in a rathole mine in Meghalaya, data tabled in the Lok Sabha earlier this week revealed that 377 workers involved in mining of coal, minerals and oil were killed in accidents between 2015 and 2017. Of the 377 deaths, 129 occurred in 2017 alone. As many as 145 died in 2016, while the figure was 103 in 2015. Coal mines have accounted for the highest number of casualties due to accidents in mines. Of the 377, more than half, 210, were killed in coal mines. These figures were provided by the Labour and Employment Ministry on December 31, 2018 in response to a question raised by Laxman Giluwa, BJP MP from Jharkhand. Jharkhand, which recorded 69 deaths (11 in 2015, 46 in 2016 and 12 in 2017) in the three years, has accounted for the highest death of coal mine workers in accidents inside mines. Goda in Jharkhand witnessed one of the biggest open cast mine accidents in 2016 when 23 workers died in December that year. Telangana recorded 32 deaths in these three years while Madhya Pradesh registered 29. During the period, 152 persons died in accidents in metal mines across the country. Rajasthan, one of highest mineral producing States in the country, accounted for 48 deaths (20 in 2015, five in 2016 and 23 in 2017) while Andhra Pradesh recorded 29 deaths. During this period, 15 deaths were reported in oil mines, most of them occurring in Assam and Gujarat.|0|
Sinha, Shourie urge court to ‘recall’ Rafale order|NEW DELHI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Supreme Court should not just review but even consider recalling its “erroneous” judgement, which relied on a “non-existent” report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General (CAG) to uphold the purchase of 36 Rafale jets, former Union Ministers Yashwant Sinha and Arun Shourie submitted before the court on Wednesday. The office of the CAG has not yet concluded its audit of the Rafale contract. The judgment’s reliance on a hypothetical CAG report was not merely a “clerical or arithmetical slip” in judgment, but a substantial error which deserved the recall of the December 14 judgment, the former Ministers, joined by advocate Prashant Bhushan, argued. The December 14 judgment said the CAG report had been finalised and placed before the Public Accounts Committee (PAC). Further, a “redacted” report would be placed in Parliament and in the public domain, according to the verdict. This information was “patently false” and based on the confidential note given to the court by the government, the petitioners contended. Besides, the petitioners were not given an opportunity to rebut the note, they said. The petitioners pooh-poohed the government’s application in the Supreme Court to “correct” the judgment. The application, they argued, was filed after a public furore broke out about the verdict. The government said the court “misinterpreted” its note, which was only citing the procedure to be followed after the CAG finalised its report. If it was “procedure”, the note should have said the CAG report “will/would” be placed before the PAC and not “is placed before the PAC”, the former Ministers said. They asked why the Supreme Court Bench led by Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi chose not to call for the “primary documents” of the Rafale contract. The Bench had relied wholly on a secondary document like the sealed cover note which contained “gross factual errors”. The petitioners said the CAG is an independent constitutional body accountable only to Parliament. The government’s claim that the CAG’s final report on Rafale would be in a redacted form was simply untrue. In fact, the government cannot dictate to the CAG what should or should not be redacted.|0|
High drama in Lok Sabha|New Delhi|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday raised the Congress’s record in defence deals, including the role of Mr. Q and alleged revelations by Christian Michel who took the name of “Mrs Gandhi” in the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper deal. And while the Opposition and Treasury benches faced off, the Lok Sabha witnessed unprecedented scenes of AIADMK MPs climbing and standing on a front row seat with placards and Congress MPs flying paper planes while Mr. Jaitley was speaking. Apart from the Congress, others in the Opposition including the Trinamool Congress, CPI(M), NCP and Biju Janata Dal raised questions on the deal and asked for a closer examination of the facts by Parliament. There were dramatic moments as Congress president Rahul Gandhi sought Speaker Sumitra Mahajan’s permission to play a controversial audio clip of a Goa Minister who said Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar had all the files on the Rafale deal with him. While the Speaker denied permission, Mr. Jaitley accused the Congress of “manufacturing the audio clip.” He threw an immediate challenge: either Mr. Gandhi must authenticate the audio clip or face expulsion. Opening the debate, Mr. Gandhi countered Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s claim, in an interview to news agency ANI, that there were no personal allegations against him. The Congress chief said the “whole country” was pointing direct questions at Mr. Modi. Where are the planes? Posing a series of questions, Mr. Gandhi asked why did the government change the UPA’s order of 126 planes to 36 planes, did the Indian Air Force ask it to do so and if it was because of urgency, why not a single Rafale jet had landed in India until now. “He (Modi) spoke for 90 minutes in a staged interview but still did not answer questions on the Rafale issue,” the Congress chief said and reiterated his demand for a JPC. He said Defence Ministry officials had objected to the inflated price of Rs. 1,600 an aircraft that went up from the UPA’s Rs. 526 crore and only a JPC can find the truth as the Supreme Court lacked the jurisdiction. “We demand a JPC probe into the matter. There is no reason for BJP leaders to feel afraid. The country will get to know that Modi put Rs. 30,000 crore in the pockets of ‘double A’. The contract was snatched from HAL (a government-run unit),” Mr. Gandhi said. He alleged that the deal favoured industrialist Anil Ambani, who he referred to as double A after the Speaker asked not to name a person who is not a Lok Sabha member. The Minister countered that under the renegotiated deal, the fully loaded aircraft was 20% cheaper than what the UPA had agreed, and accused Mr. Gandhi of manufacturing lies, as he was someone who had a natural dislike for truth.|0|

Venkaiah sends out T.N. MPs|New Delhi|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Invoking the rules of procedure, Rajya Sabha Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu asked 12 All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) members to leave for the day, as despite repeated requests and warning they continued to remain in the well of the House protesting against the proposed Mekadatu dam on the Cauvery. The move came after an emergency meeting between the two Tamil Nadu parties and Water Resources Minister Nitin Gadkari failed to break the ice. Mr. Gadkari was summoned by Mr. Naidu to listen to the concerns of the two parties. The Minister, according to sources, said the dam would not be constructed without the consent of the Tamil Nadu government. He, however, refused to recall the order of the Central Water Commission (CWC) giving in-principle approval for Karnataka to prepare a detailed project report, the first step towards construction of the dam. He said the commission was just following procedure. “We are not satisfied with the response of the Minister. The CWC has no jurisdiction to pass this order. As per the Supreme Court judgment, only the Cauvery Management Authority has the right to take decisions. Until the government withdraws the CWC order, we will continue with our protests,” A. Navaneethakrishnan, AIADMK floor leader in the Rajya Sabha, toldThe Hindu. DMK MP Tiruchi Siva too said the only way to arrive at a truce was to withdraw the CWC order. Those who were told to leave were Mr. Navaneethakrishnan, S. Muthukaruppan, N. Gokulakrishnan, A.K. Selvaraj, R. Lakshmanan, Vijila Sathyananth, S.R. Balasubramoniyan, A. Vijayakumar, R.S. Bharathi, Tiruchi Siva, Kanimozhi and T.K.S. Elangovan. Appeal to Chairman According to sources, Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, NCP leader Sharad Pawar and Trinamool Congress leader Derek O’ Brien met Mr. Naidu urging him not to insist on further action against the named MPs. The two parties have been protesting in the Upper House since the start of the winter session on December 11, the AIADMK with placards in the well of the House and the DMK members mutely standing at their seats. On Wednesday, the DMK MPs too joined AIADMK members in the well and shouted slogans. DMK’s Tiruchi Siva led the sloganeering with the call “Vendum[We want],vendum” and AIADMK members chiming in response “Needhi[Justice]vendum.” Despite the Chair’s ruling, the members continued to shout slogans, resulting in two breaks before the House was adjourned till Thursday.|0|
Hindus cannot wait till eternity, says VHP|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Mr. Kumar said the VHP had by now contacted 350 members of Parliament, but was waiting for appointments with UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Congress president Rahul Gandhi to try and persuade them to support a Bill aiding the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya. Mr. Modi’s comments had come amid heightened demands by Hindutva organisations, including the RSS, for an ordinance for early construction of the temple in Ayodhya. The government also faced fire from its ally, Shiv Sena, with party MP Sanjay Raut putting out a strong statement. “We don’t need the Prime Minister to tell us that the matter is in court. If that’s what we wanted what was the need for the movement? Karsewaks martyred, bomb blasts in Mumbai, riots; it was genocide in the Ram temple’s name, who is responsible? You [the BJP] formed the government on this issue, don’t forget that,” he said.|0|
New panel to protect Assam’s heritage|New Delhi|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved the setting up of a high-level committee for implementation of Clause 6 of the Assam Accord which provides for constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards to protect, preserve and promote the cultural, social, linguistic identity and heritage of Assam. It also recommended reserving Assembly seats for indigenous communities in the State. Home Minister Rajnath Singh had assured Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal in May 2018 that a committee would be set up at the earliest in consultation with the State government. “It has been felt that Clause 6 of the Assam Accord has not been fully implemented even almost 35 years after the accord was signed,” Mr. Rajnath Singh told a press conference on Wednesday. “The committee will assess the requirement of measures to be taken to protect Assamese and other indigenous languages and the quantum of reservation in employment,” Mr. Singh said. The Cabinet approved several measures to fulfil the demands of the Bodo community. It approved the establishment of a Bodo Museum-cum-language and cultural study centre, modernisation of the existing AIR station and Doordarshan Kendra at Kokrajhar and naming a superfast train as Aronai Express.|0|

Share swap ratio for bank merger cleared|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|There are 15,784 employees of Vijaya Bank and Dena’s headcount is 13,440. The merged entity would have 85,675 employees. ‘No retrenchment’ Announcing the Cabinet decision, Law and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said the merger would not result in the retrenchment of any employee, a major fear the banking unions have voiced and held strikes over. The government expected that the merged entity would be better equipped to meet the credit needs of a growing economy, absorb shocks and capacity to raise resources. Commenting on the strengths of the individual banks, the government said while Dena Bank had a relatively higher access to low-cost deposits, Vijaya Bank’s was its profitability and availability of capital for growth. “The extensive and global network and offerings of BoB will translate into advantages in terms of market reach, operational efficiencies and the ability to support a wider offering of product and services,” it said. The merged entity would be the second largest commercial bank in the country, after State Bank of India. The total business would be about Rs. 15 lakh crore, with almost 9,500 domestic branches. “Benefits would also flow as a result of wider reach and distribution network, and reduction in distribution costs for the products and services through subsidiaries,” the government said.|0|

Sabarimala issue:|Udupi/Hassan|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The entry of two women into the Sabarimala temple on Wednesday has sparked off a debate in Karnataka as well. Vishwesha Tirtha Swami of Pejawar Mutt said on Wednesday that his stand on the issue of women’s entry into Sabarimala temple was neutral and the ‘shastras’ per se do not ban it. Speaking toThe Hinduover telephone, the Pejawar seer said, “In Sabarimala, there is no entry for women in the temple. But women are given entry in other temples [in the country]. However, there is nothing in the ‘shastras’ that bars or restricts the entry of women into temples. So I do not know what I should say about this Sabarimala issue. Hence, I am neutral over this issue.” He said that women had been entering temples for so many centuries, and “Earlier Dalits were not being allowed into the temples in the name of tradition. But this tradition has long been broken and there has been entry of Dalits into the temples,” he said. Another seer, Vidyadheesha Tirtha Swami of Paryaya Palimar Mutt, said that religion has its own “protocols”, which should be respected with regard to the entry of women to the Lord Ayyapa temple at Sabarimala.  Welcomes move Meanwhile, Dr. Channasiddharama Panditaradhya swami of Shreeshaila mutt said at Belagavi on Wednesday that men and women were both equal and there should not be any discrimination. “Women have the right to worship, just like men. Gender differences should not come in the way of his or her right to worship,” he said. “Some temples have some old traditions of banning women from their premises, under some conditions. However, all this needs to change in keeping with the changing times. Temples should also change their rules as per changing times and the desires of the people,” he said. “I believe that allowing women entry into temples is a good development.”   Earlier, Dalits were not being allowed into the temples in the name of tradition.

The legislation proposes telecom service providers, apart from using Aadhaar for authentication, can leverage offline verification, use of passport, or any other officially valid document or modes of identification as notified by the Central government. The amendments, according to the objects and reasons for the Bill, will “provide for 12-digit Aadhaar number and its alternative numbers to be generated” in a manner so as to conceal the actual Aadhaar number. It would also “permit the entities performing authentication only when they are compliant with the standards of privacy and security.” The Bill seeks to lay down the procedure for offline verification of an Aadhaar number holder, and confers enhanced regulator-like power on the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) to give directions as it may consider necessary to any entity in the Aadhaar ecosystem. It says that every requesting entity to whom an authentication request is made, will inform the Aadhaar number holder of alternative and viable means of identification and shall not deny any service to them for refusing to, or being unable to undergo authentication. Mandatory authentication of an Aadhaar holder for the provision of any service will take place if such authentication is required by a law made by Parliament. The Bill proposes a civil penalty of up to Rs. 1 crore on entities that violate the the Aadhaar Act, with an additional fine of up to Rs. 10 lakh per day in case of continuous non-compliance.|0|
Train 18 may run this month|NEW DELHI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The indigenously-built, semi high-speed train, dubbed Train 18, is likely to start operations this month, with the first run being between Delhi and Varanasi, a senior railway official said. Train 18, touted as the successor to the Shatabdi series, can run at a speed of between 160 and 200 kmph. Manufactured by the Integral Coach Factory, Chennai, at a cost of Rs. 100 crore, Train 18 touched a high speed of over 180 kmph during trial run. However, once it is launched, it is expected to run at 130 kmph speed. The official said the train would cover the distance between Delhi and Varanasi in eight hours, compared to over 11 hours at present.|0|
Sena demands JPC investigation|NEW DELHI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Shiv Sena, a member of the National Democratic Alliance, embarrassed the government in the Lok Sabha debate on the Rafale deal on Wednesday when party MP Arvind Sawant echoed the Opposition’s demand for a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) investigation. “Aren’t we a clean government? So, let us have a JPC; everything will become clear,” Mr. Sawant said, urging the government to agree to the setting up of a JPC to look into the issue. Earlier, Mr. Sawant raised questions on the Rafale deal, seeking to know why a private company was preferred over state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. (HAL), which had wide experience in the field. “The Defence Minister did not go to France with the Prime Minister. An industrialist went with him. His company existed only on paper. The HAL had everything required. Why was that agreement done with him [the industrialist]? You do a contract with a company that exists only on paper,” Mr. Sawant said. “The HAL CMD has said we can manufacture the aircraft. Why was it denied that role?” He said that France had even refused a sovereign agreement on the deal. Drawing a parallel with the Bofors scam, Mr. Sawant said, “People said ‘Bofors was good but the deal was bad’. People now say that ‘Rafale is good but the deal is bad’. Why not agree to constitute a JPC? Are we afraid of the Opposition? We are a clean government. Give them a JPC.” Trinamool stand Saugata Roy of the Trinamool Congress faulted the government for ordering just 36 Rafale aircraft for Rs. 59,000 crore. “The UPA price was just Rs. 526 crore per aircraft. Why was it renegotiated at Rs. 1,671 crore per aircraft,” Mr. Roy asked. Referring to the government’s argument of immediacy involved in the purchase, he said that while Mr. Modi announced the deal in April 2015, the Defence Minister signed it one year and four months later. “A company registered only 12 days before the PM went to France... Why was a Johnny-come-lately given preference over the trusted HAL,” Mr. Roy asked. Mohammad Salim of the CPI(M) said the team negotiating the commercial terms said the price had increased in the new deal.  Aren’t we a clean government? So, let us have a JPC Arvind Sawant Shiv Sena MP|0|
Operation was kept under wraps to ensure safe passage|Pathanamthitta|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The entry of two young women into the Sabarimala temple under police protection on Wednesday morning was a swift, closely-guarded operation and devoid of any drama, unlike previous attempts when protesters mobilised in strength to force them to turn back. The two women, Bindu and Kanakadurga, clad in salwar and kurta, reached the hilltop ‘Sannidhanam’ around 3 a.m. They were sheltered by the police and later escorted to the Ayyappa temple premises in the next 50 minutes. Skirting the 18 holy steps, they entered the temple through the front door, where a few policemen were deployed to check the entry of pilgrims. Video footage showed them entering through the staff gate on the northern side of the temple at 3.48 a.m. and being escorted out by plainclothes police through the barricade in front of the holy steps at 3.50 a.m. The policemen on duty at the temple were reportedly told by plainclothesmen that the women were ‘relatives’ of an Inspector General of Police. Police escorted the women downhill to Pampa in the next 45 minutes and from there to Angamaly, which is over 113 km away. Later they were shifted to an undisclosed location. Previous bid Ms. Bindu and Ms. Kanakadurga had tried to visit the temple on December 24 during the ‘Mandalam’ pilgrimage season, but failed amidst massive protests by Sangh Parivar activists and a section of the devotees. Sabarimala witnessed no protest on Wednesday, as news about the entry of the duo was aired only after they left Pampa. Ms. Bindu herself sent a video to a private TV channel. The police too confirmed it later.|0|
Minor among two lynched in Bihar|PATNA|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Two persons, including a minor, were lynched by a mob on Wednesday in Nalanda district of Bihar on suspicion of being involved in the killing of a local Rashtriya Janata Dal leader. A member of RJD’s SC/ST cell Indal Paswan of Maghra village under Deep Nagar police station of Nalanda district was killed on Tuesday night. ‘Heated argument’ “Indal Paswan had a shop selling construction material and he had a heated argument with someone on Tuesday evening... he was shot dead when he was returning home from a funeral,” Deep Nagar Police station in-charge Dharmendra Kumar said. The RJD leader’s killing triggered a massive outrage among locals and his supporters, who staged a protest at the district headquarters Biharsharief and shouted slogan against the Nitish Kumar government. Nalanda is the home district of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. Later, the protesting mob attacked the house of two suspects Raj Kumar Malakar, 40 and Ranjan Kumar, 15, and beat them up. Ranjan Kumar died on the spot, while Raj Kumar Malakar alias Santu Malakar, succumbed to his injuries on the way to Patna Medical College and Hospital. The mob also set houses of two more suspects, Naresh Choudhury and Chunni Lal Paswan, on fire.|0|
Chief priest’s action violates Supreme Court verdict|NEW DELHI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Closure of the Sabarimala temple’ssanctum sanctorumon Wednesday to perform ‘purification rites’ after two women of menstruating age managed to enter may amount to using the concept of impurity and pollution to violate the women’s right against untouchability. Though temple priest Kandararu Rajeevaru explained that his action should not be treated as “any discrimination towards women”, the Supreme Court has clearly laid down in its September 28 verdict – which is not yet stayed and is fully operational — that any form of exclusion based on concepts of “purity and pollution” amounts to untouchability, a practice abolished under Article 17 of the Constitution. Notions of “purity and pollution”, which stigmatise individuals, can have no place in a constitutional regime, the Supreme Court had held in its Sabarimala judgment. The court made it clear that untouchability was not confined to practices relating to lower castes. Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, in his opinion, expanded untouchability to any practice which amounts to “systemic humiliation, exclusion and subjugation faced by women.” Review petitions A five-judge Bench led by Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi is scheduled to hear on January 22 the review petitions, including one by Rajeevaru, against the verdict which struck down the ban on the entry of women of menstrual age into the temple. Symbol of exclusion “Prejudice against women based on notions of impurity and pollution associated with menstruation is a symbol of exclusion. The social exclusion of women, based on menstrual status, is but a form of untouchability which is anathema to constitutional values,” Justice Chandrachud observed in his opinion. The court held that “regarding menstruation as polluting or impure, and worse still, imposing exclusionary disabilities on the basis of menstrual status, is against the dignity of women which is guaranteed by the Constitution.” The main opinion, written by then Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra, said it was “an essential part of the Hindu religion to allow Hindu women to enter into a temple as devotees and followers of Hindu religion and offer their prayers to the deity.”|0|
Water being drained out of Meghalaya mine|GUWAHATI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Odisha fire service personnel drained more water out of an old shaft adjoining the coal mine in Meghalaya where 15 miners have been trapped since December 13. They reduced the water level to a little more than 16 inches. The old shaft and the main one where the miners have been trapped are interconnected underneath, officials said. A renewed search and rescue operation started on December 30. After Navy divers conducted an initial survey with remote-controlled detection devices, the fire service personnel started draining water out of the adjoining abandoned shaft on Tuesday. “The fire service personnel brought down the water level by 16.4 inches between 10.30 a.m. and 5.10 p.m. Coal India Limited is preparing to put a 100-HP submersible pump that can discharge a higher volume of water. Navy divers can work after the water in the main shaft goes down,” a spokesperson for the East Jaintia Hills district administration said on Wednesday.|0|
Consensual physical relationship between live-in partners not rape, says SC|New Delhi|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Consensual relations between live-in partners does not amount to rape in case the man fails to marry the woman due to circumstances beyond his control, the Supreme Court has held. The top court said this while quashing an FIR lodged by a Maharashtra-based nurse against a doctor, with whom she was in a live-in relationship “for quite some time”. “There is a clear distinction between rape and consensual sex. The court, in such cases, must very carefully examine whether the complainant had actually wanted to marry the victim or had mala fide motives and had made a false promise to this effect only to satisfy his lust, as the later falls within the ambit of cheating or deception,” a Bench of Justices A.K. Sikri and S. Abdul Nazeer said. The Bench also said if “the accused has not made the promise with the sole intention to seduce the [woman] to indulge in sexual acts, such an act would not amount to rape”. According to the FIR, the woman had fallen in love with the doctor and they started living together. “There may be a case where the [woman] agrees to have sexual intercourse on account of her love and passion for the accused and not solely on account of the misconception created by accused, or where an accused, on account of circumstances which he could not have foreseen or which were beyond his control, was unable to marry her despite having every intention to do. Such cases must be treated differently,” the Bench said.|0|
Opposition parties boycott Governor’s address to House|CHENNAI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Opposition parties, led by DMK president M.K. Stalin, boycotted Governor Banwarilal Purohit’s address in the Assembly on Wednesday. They staged a walkout after the Leader of the Opposition attempted unsuccessfully to raise some issues in the House. Soon after the Governor began his address by greeting everyone on the occasion of the first Assembly session of 2019, Mr. Stalin sought to raise some issues, but wasn’t allowed to do so. Continuing his speech, the Governor then spoke a few sentences in Tamil, urging everyone to lead a simple life. After his repeated attempts to speak went in vain, Mr. Stalin, along with his party legislators, staged a walkout. Members of the DMK’s allies in the House – the Congress and the Indian Union Muslim League — followed suit.  ‘Speech disappointing’ MDMK chief Vaiko, CPI(M) State secretary K. Balakrishnan and TMC president G.K. Vasan termed the Governor’s speech in the Assembly a ‘disappointment’. In a statement, Mr. Vaiko said the Governor’s speech only underscored that the Edappadi K. Palaniswami-led government was bowing to pressure from the Centre on issues like NEET and the National Medical Council Bill. Mr. Vasan said the speech did not have any mention of providing full compensation to those affected by Cyclone Gaja and did not have any announcement on farm loan waivers. It did not mention the implementation of total prohibition either, he said. Mr. Balakrishnan said the Governor’s speech was “just a summary of a non-functional government”.|0|

Gujarat BJP leaders fight over location of AIIMS|AHMEDABAD|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Union government is yet to announce the setting up of a world-class All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s home State Gujarat, but some State Bharatiya Janata Party leaders are already fighting over its location. Gujarat BJP leaders and legislators from Rajkot and Vadodara have been fighting over the venue of the facility, which is likely to be set up in the State. Recently, Gujarat State BJP president Jitu Vaghani said in Rajkot that the AIIMS would be set up in Rajkot to cater to the healthcare needs of the people of the Saurashtra region. Mr. Vaghani said this while campaigning for the recently held by-election for the Jasdan Assembly constituency in Rajkot district. Mr. Vaghani’s impromptu announcement caught even State Ministers off guard. Deputy Chief Minister and Health Minister Nitin Patel feigned ignorance over an AIIMS in Rajkot. “I am not aware of any development regarding the AIIMS in Rajkot,” Mr. Patel reportedly said. Legislators meet CM Subsequently, a group of eight legislators from the Vadodara district called on Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani in an attempt to persuade him to select Vadodara as the venue for the institute. “We want an AIIMS in Vadodara as was promised earlier. Now, they cannot change the location and pick Rajkot,” said the party’s veteran legislator Yogesh Patel, who led the delegation of legislators from central Gujarat to the Chief Minister. According to Mr. Patel, there are tribal pockets like Chhota Udepur, Narmada, Godhara and Dahod near Vadodara, so a world class medical institute can cater to them, too, besides Vadodara city. Another legislator who was part of the delegation said that the Chief Minister himself was not sure whether Rajkot was being picked as the location for the AIIMS, as was suggested by the State party chief.|0|
Oil cos not to recoup losses arising from Re 1/ltr subsidy on petrol, diesel|New Delhi|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|  State-owned oil firms have no plans to recoup losses they incurred on subsidising petrol and diesel by Rs. 1 per litre, top officials said.

RLSP may get four seats, claims party leader|Patna|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The opposition Grand Alliance in Bihar has agreed to give as many as four seats to former Union Minister Upendra Kushwaha’s Rashtriya Lok Samata Party in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls, double the number it was offered by the BJP-led NDA, a senior party leader claimed on Wednesday.

Trade Unions Act to be amended|NEW DELHI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Centre proposes to amend the Trade Unions Act, 1926, to facilitate recognition of trade unions at the Central and federal level. The Union Cabinet approved the amendment on Wednesday. Most trade unions, however, vehemently opposed the proposed amendments, saying the government was trying to interfere in, and cripple, their functioning. Ten Central trade unions had earlier written to the Labour Ministry objecting to the draft version of the amendment Bill; the only major standout was the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. Unrest and litigations The amendment will “ensure that the nomination of workers’ representatives in tripartite bodies by the government will become more transparent… and reduce litigation and industrial unrest,” according to an official statement. Trade unions which are recognised under the amended law “would be accountable in maintaining industrial harmony,” it said. “This is a dilution of the Trade Unions Act,” said Tapan Sen, general secretary of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), affiliated to the Communist Party of India (Marxist). He said the amendments were politically motivated, and would only give power to the government itself. “We have opposed the interference of the government in the recognition of trade unions,” said Amarjeet Kaur, general secretary of the CPI-affiliated All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), pointing out that there were already established procedures in place to verify the Central and State unions. Ten Central trade unions have issued a general strike call on January 8 and 9.|0|

BJP MP welcomes entry of women at Sabarimala|NEW DELHI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|  Bharatiya Janata Party MP Udit Raj welcomed the entry of women into the Sabarimala shrine on Wednesday, while his party has opposed it and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his interview on Tuesday, termed it a matter of “tradition”. Mr. Raj, speaking toThe Hindu, however made it clear that he held these views in his personal capacity rather than as a member of the BJP which is agitating against the entry of women into Sabarimala. “I hold these views in my personal capacity and as the head of the SC/ST and women Parisangh, one of the largest such organisations in the country,” he said. “The entry of women in Sabarimala is to be welcomed, and it is the way ahead for gender equality and for equality before law for all,” he said.|0|

Governor Banwarilal Purohit made the announcement in the Assembly on Wednesday. The Governor said the State government had formulated a comprehensive housing project called the Tamil Nadu Housing and Habitat Development Project to transform slums in Chennai, Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram districts with financial assistance from the World Bank. “A similar project for areas other than the Chennai Metropolitan Area has been posed to the Asian Development Bank for assistance. The Common Building Rules will also be notified shortly to enhance the ease of doing business in the housing sector,” Mr. Purohit said. The Chennai Metro’s Phase – I had already commenced operations, and was expected to be fully commissioned by this month, he said, adding that the Phase-I extension from Washermanpet to Wimco Nagar, at an estimated cost of Rs. 3,770 crore, would be ready for inauguration by June 2020, as scheduled.

Stalin not to contest Tiruvarur bypoll|CHENNAI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|DMK leader M.K. Stalin, who was under pressure from a section of senior party leaders to contest the Tiruvarur bypoll, has opted out of the race. Party sources said he had decided against contesting in Tiruvarur as it would trigger a bypoll in his Kolathur constituency. Mr. Stalin himself made light of the issue on Wednesday, when he told journalists, “Who would be contesting — whether it would be me or Mr. Duraimurugan or Mr. T.R. Baalu — would be known on January 4.” Talking to reporters after the party MLAs’ meeting, he said there was a mystery behind the Election Commission’s decision to hold the bypoll to Tiruvarur alone. “Moreover, what is the need for conducting an election in Tiruvarur without holding it in Tirupparankundram? Whatever may be the reason, the DMK is fully prepared to face the elections,” he said. He also suspected a conspiracy in the disqualification of the 18 dissident AIADMK MLAs.   What is the need for conducting an election in Tiruvarur without holding it in Tirupparan-kundram?|0|
Can’t prevent Tiruvarur bypoll: HC|CHENNAI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Madras High Court on Wednesday made it clear that its powers to interfere in election issues were very limited. Therefore, it would not be able to prevent Election Commission of India (ECI) from going ahead with its decision to conduct the byelection to Tiruvarur Assembly constituency on January 28. Rejecting a plea to move a lunch motion, a Division Bench of Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and P. Rajamanickam told advocate N.G.R. Prasad that it would hear the case only in the regular course and even then it would not grant any interim order preventing the ECI from conducting the bypoll as prayed for by him. “You know our powers. We are telling you right now that we shall not stay the election notification. You say that elections would hamper Cyclone Gaja relief works, but the Election Commission, a constitutional body, says the situation is conducive for conduct of election. What can we do,” the senior judge in the Bench said. Later, in the day, a writ petition was filed in the High Court Registry by V. Sathyanarayanan, 57, general secretary of Cauvery Delta Farmers Consortium, an unregistered association, to forbear the EC from conducting the bypoll on January 28, as announced on December 31. Asserting that he was not affiliated to any political party, the petitioner claimed that people of Tiruvarur constituency would not only be denied of the cyclone relief, but also the joy of celebrating Pongal festival if the model code of conduct came into force and the election notification was allowed to be published in the gazette on Thursday.|0|
Revellers go on the rampage in park|CHENNAI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Revellers went on the rampage at an amusement park in Injambakkam, disappointed over denial of adequate food and drinks, despite the organisers collecting huge sums for entry. A private entertainment firm had organised New Year celebrations in the open area of the VGP Golden Beach Injambakkam on Monday night. They had sold tickets worth Rs. 1,500 for a person and Rs. 3,000 for couples, offering discounts such as unlimited liquor. With crowds swelling beyond expectations, no proper arrangements were made to serve food and liquor. Moreover, the organisers failed to conduct the programme as per the schedule given earlier. Venue ransacked People were disappointed as they did not get food at 9 p.m. According to the participants, the organisers stopped serving liquor early. Infuriated, the guests had heated arguments with the staff of the firm. Since there was no response from the staff, the guests ransacked the venue. The police had to intervene, and had a tough time getting the crowd to disperse. When the irate guests demanded their money back, police personnel resorted to force. The programme was abruptly stopped. Neither the guests nor the organisers have preferred any complaint with the police. “We paid Rs. 25,000 for our family to celebrate the New Year. We did not expect that such an unfortunate event would occur. The organisers sold more tickets and allowed more persons than what the capacity of the premises permitted,” said a woman who was here to participate in the event.|0|

On December 30, Tasmac sold liquor worth Rs. 113 crore as against Rs. 90.97 crore on the same day in 2017.

Mr. Purohit underlined the State’s opposition to Karnataka’s proposal to construct a dam across the Cauvery at Mekedatu and also to Kerala’s attempts to construct a new dam to replace the existing Mullaperiyar dam.

On the issue of the Sri Lankan authorities arresting Tamil Nadu fishermen, he said the Centre should work with the neighbouring nation on finding an amicable and lasting solution. He thanked the Central government for supporting the ongoing restoration efforts in Tamil Nadu in the wake of Cyclone Gaja and urged it to extend adequate financial assistance to the State to rebuild the damaged homes and restore the livelihood of those affected. On the reopening of the Sterlite Copper plant in Thoothukudi, the Governor said the State government will appeal against the National Green Tribunal’s order. The State would also seek amendments to the National Medical Commission Bill, the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Bill and the Electricity Bill and demand the withdrawal of the Dam Safety Bill. The Governor said the Dam Safety Bill, which was introduced in Parliament, infringed upon the State’s rights, adding that he hoped the concerns of Tamil Nadu would be impartially addressed and resolved by the Centre. Though Tamil Nadu continued to be a fiscally prudent State, “the revenue deficit has been on the rise in recent years”, mainly due to the devolution formulae evolved by the 14th Finance Commission, he said. “I earnestly hope that the 15th Finance Commission will uphold the principles of equity and efficiency and will give a fair deal in financial devolution to Tamil Nadu,” he added. Dues from Centre As for the implementation of the GST regime, the Governor said the Centre was yet to settle IGST dues of Rs. 5,454 crore for 2017-18 and make short payments on GST compensation to the tune of Rs. 455 crore for 2017-18 and Rs. 1,305 crore for the period between April and September 2018, which were adversely affecting the State’s finances. “I urge the Central government to settle these dues at the earliest and ensure prompt release of such dues in future,” the Governor said. Since the Tamil Nadu government was “forced to bear almost the entire liability” in the post-matric scholarship scheme for students from socially disadvantaged sections, the Governor requested the Centre to reconsider the matter and hoped that the guidelines would be revised so that the expenses were shared by the Centre and the States. The Centre was planning to close research units such as the Central Institute of Brackishwater Aquaculture (CIBA) in Chennai and the Sugarcane Breeding Institute in Coimbatore. Such moves will “adversely impact the scientific research work in Tamil Nadu” aimed at bettering the lives of farmers and fishermen, Mr. Purohit said. Lauding Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, the Governor said, “His able leadership has made the administration responsive to public needs and has been taking swift decisions by clearing an unprecedented number of 11,286 files since he assumed office.”|0|
‘Steel flyover will be saturated’|Bengaluru|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|As revival of the contentious steel flyover project by the coalition government made headlines, a mobility and traffic volume study of the project on the road to Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) has argued that the flyover would be saturated with traffic volumes beyond its capacity on the day of its inauguration. The study ‘Shifting Focus from Supply to Demand – The Changing Face of Transportation towards Sustainability’ is by Ashish Verma, associate professor, CiSTUP, Indian Institute of Science (IISc.). It argues that a metro line (with 2 Up lines and 2 Down lines) on the same corridor can easily serve commuters up to 2044. Deputy Chief Minister and Bengaluru development minister Dr. G. Parameshwara, on Tuesday, had announced that the government is reviving the steel flyover project on ‘popular demand’ to ease the commute to the KIA. The previous Congress government had dropped the project in March 2017 following stiff opposition from civic groups. The Deputy CM’s announcement has drawn the ire of the civic activists again. The IISc. study argues that the steel flyover would not ease the commute to KIA, as is being claimed by the government. The study considers three scenarios: annual vehicle growth rate at 4.5%, as mentioned by Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) in the steel flyover DPR, 10.6% traffic volume growth replicating the volume growth at KIA over the past nine years, and number of cars double every five years in the city. The study says that the vehicle to capacity ratio in Mehkri Circle is already 2. Going by the BDA’s estimated 4.5% annual growth of traffic, this will only worsen over two years, which is the estimated time taken to complete the project. Essentially, traffic volume would have exceeded road capacity by several times on the day the flyover would be inaugurated, the study says. At the same time, a metro line on the corridor, with half the passengers shifting to metro, will serve the corridor till 2087. The 4.5% annual growth of traffic is a very optimistic assumption, argues Dr. Verma. KIA has seen an annual traffic growth of 10.6% over the past nine years. Assuming traffic on the airport corridor will mirror this trend, the corridor-with-a-flyover already has 2 times traffic volume than the road capacity at Mehkri Circle. A metro line on the corridor will serve till 2048 with half the passengers shift to the metro, he said. Dr. Verma said the number of cars have been doubling every five years over the past decades. The corridor already has traffic volume of over three times the combined capacity of the corridor-with-a-flyover. Even with such high traffic growth, a metro line on the corridor will serve till 2044 if even half of the passengers shift to metro rail, he said. He said that Indian cities are facing ‘a vicious cycle of congestion’ fuelled by exponential growth of car ownership, a situation developed economies have already faced: USA 50 years ago and Europe 40 years ago. “We are reinventing the wheel. There are many examples of nations, like Netherlands, that have come out of the vicious circle of congestion through sustainable transport solutions – mass transit systems and non-motorised transport,” he said.|0|

Waterbodies in north and west Chennai to be restored|CHENNAI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Waterbodies in north and west Chennai that have been neglected for decades are now being rejuvenated. The Environmentalist Foundation of India (EFI), which has been involved in the revival of the city’s waterbodies, has now turned its focus to ponds in these parts of the city. The EFI has identified nearly 15 ponds in Chennai, Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram districts that are in dire need of restoration. Arun, founder of EFI, said: “We restored 17 ponds, including ones in the northern and western parts of the city last year, with the support of local bodies and community participation. This includes ponds in Minjur, Theeyambakkam near Manali, Kullapan Nagar in Mandhavaram and Vinayagapuram near Retteri.” “We found that many of them remained neglected for several decades. The Minjur pond had turned into a space for dumping trash and volunteers removed trash and plugged sewage outfalls,” he said. They then deepened the waterbody and fenced it, he added. This year, the organisation is taking up work to restore 15 ponds such as Arrakulam, Vairavankulam and Mandapamkuttai in Ambattur zone, Aluvancheri near Porur and Thalambur and Egattur along Rajiv Gandhi Salai. Similar neglect These ponds are of various sizes but face similar kind of neglect. The restoration of ponds would also help in building capacity to handle localised flooding and drought, and prevent soil and water contamination, Mr. Arun said. Welcoming the move, residents said it would help in groundwater recharge. T. Gunaseelan, a resident of Ambattur, said a compound wall must be built around waterbodies that were restored, to prevent encroachments. Government agencies must also maintain an inventory of ponds, he suggested.|0|
Ageing bus fleets to get BS-VI vehicles as replacement|Chennai|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Governor Banwarilal Purohit on Wednesday told the Assembly that a comprehensive restructuring programme for State-run transport corporations would be introduced with the support of the German bilateral financing agency KfW. “This would involve replacement of the ageing fleet with fuel efficient BS-VI buses and procurement of environment-friendly electric buses in metro cities like Chennai, Coimbatore and Madurai,” he said. Besides, a comprehensive Athikadavu-Avinashi scheme, aimed at recharging groundwater and augmenting water supply in Coimbatore, Erode and Tirupur districts at a cost of Rs. 1,652 crore to benefit 24,468 acres of cultivated lands, would be launched very soon by the Chief Minister, the Governor said. On the appointment of Vice-Chancellors, the Governor said: “Higher education institutions should be headed by competent and talented Vice-Chancellors to improve the quality of teaching and research to international standards. Accordingly, this government is adopting a transparent selection procedure in appointing Vice-Chancellors. Similarly the vacancies in the syndicate of Universities are being filled up promptly.” Boosting literacy Since literacy among tribal communities is significantly lower than the State average, the Governor announced that the government would soon launch a scheme to extend financial support to non-governmental organisations for opening schools in interior tribal areas. The Governor urged the Centre to expedite the implementation of the defence industrial production corridor project. The establishment of industrial hubs for defence products in the Chennai-Vellore-Salem-Hosur-Coimbatore-Tiruchi corridor will definitely improve the prospects of Tamil Nadu as a major defence manufacturing force, he added. The first phase of upgrading 1,436 km of roads at a cost of Rs. 608 crore was under progress and the second phase to upgrade 1,538 km of roads at a cost of Rs. 882 crore had been sanctioned by the State government this year. An international conference to promote Tamil language and culture once in two years, rolling out a new startup and innovation policy, a new aerospace and defence industrial policy were among the announcements made by the Governor in the House.|0|
Items not on banned list seized, say traders|CHENNAI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Traders on Wednesday said that plastic items that aren’t on the list of banned items were also being taken away during raids by local bodies while enforcing the ban on 14 kinds of plastic goods. “We are getting videos of shop racks just being emptied out in other places. A trader in Erode lost goods worth Rs. 4 lakh in one go. These items are banned only in Tamil Nadu but not in Andhra Pradesh or Puducherry; we can sell them elsewhere. We don’t want to lose things,” said a trader, who did not want to be named.  A.M. Vikramaraja, president, Tamil Nadu Vanigar Sangankalin Peramaipu, said small vendors who made snacks at home and sold at shops were unable to pack their goods since plastic shops were closed. He said this government order was only helping multinational companies and crushing local industries.|0|
‘Purohit merely read out the government’s failure papers’|CHENNAI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Accusing the AIADMK government of having failed on all fronts, Opposition leader and DMK president M.K. Stalin on Wednesday said the Governor merely read out the “failure papers” prepared by the government during his speech to the Assembly. Explaining why his party staged a walkout during the Governor’s address, Mr. Stalin told journalists that though the State government had sought Rs. 15,000 crore as relief in the wake of Cyclone Gaja, the Centre had released merely Rs. 1,146 crore, 46 days after the cyclone ravaged the State. “Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami does not have the capacity to get adequate funds from the Centre. The failure of the government to take a policy decision against the Sterlite Copper plant [in Thoothukudi] during its Cabinet meeting has resulted in the National Green Tribunal giving a verdict in favour of the company. It is a failure on the part of Industries Minister M.C. Sampath,” he said. Six months had passed since the constitution of the Cauvery Management Board, and the Chief Minister was still not able to bring pressure to bear on the Centre to appoint a permanent chairperson to the board, Mr. Stalin said. “He couldn’t get a stay against the plan to construct a dam at Mekedatu. Karnataka’s decision [to build the dam] will turn Tamil Nadu into a desert,” the DMK leader claimed. Noting that the transfusion of HIV-infected blood to a pregnant woman at the Sattur Government Hospital had sent shockwaves across the State, he said Health Minister C. Vijaya Baskar had failed to ensure the safety of the people. He said Electricity Minister P. Thangamani had failed to find solutions to the problems of farmers opposed to the laying of high-tension power lines on their lands. “The Chief Minister is unable to remove the Health Minister from his post even after he appeared before the CBI in connection with the gutkha scam. The Cabinet [during former CM Jayalalithaa’s hospitalisation] had actually failed to save their leader, and Law Minister C.Ve. Shanmugam is now pointing the finger at former Chief Secretary Rama Mohana Rao and Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan,” he pointed out.

Better tech. would have let me play a little longer: Kapil Dev|CHENNAI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|“Had there been [better] technology then, I would have played cricket for another 5-7 years,” cricketer Kapil Dev said. While speaking at an event, where the SRM Institutes for Medical Sciences (SIMS) announced the robotic knee replacement performed at the hospital, he said he would have certainly played more cricket, had the technology in medicine been advanced. He spoke of how he underwent a knee surgery as a kid after an injury. “I have had four surgeries in my knee so far. Way back in the 80s, they didn’t have technology or systems to mend, and hence they had to open the knee to see what went wrong. Today, they don’t have to do such things. Technology is good but the person behind it is even more important,” he said. Surgeries at SIMS were perfomed using NAVIO PFS robotic surgical system, which is an advanced generation robotic intervention in joint replacement. Better accuracy Vijay C. Bose, joint-director and senior consultant, Institute of Orthopaedics, SIMS, said robotic joint replacement improves results of knee replacement surgery. “The accuracy is better and there is increased patient safety and decreased blood loss. Precision is very important in procedures like knee replacement,” he added. Actress Jyotika spoke of how her mother’s life was transformed after knee replacement. “The first time, she was operated at a hospital in Mumbai and was unhappy; so we decided to bring her to SIMS and now she is able to travel across the world,” she added.|0|
Karunaas warms up to Edappadi|CHENNAI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The ruling AIADMK received a shot in its arm on Wednesday when actor-turned-legislator S. Karunaas (Tiruvadanai) called on Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami at the Secretariat. Mr. Karunaas, who heads a fringe outfit, was elected on an AIADMK ticket but later identified himself as a supporter of rebel leader T.T.V. Dhinakaran. He had publicly criticised the Chief Minister and issued a notice of no-confidence against Speaker P. Dhanapal. But later, he quietly withdrew the notice against the Speaker. Mr. Karunaas claimed that he met the Chief Minister only to discuss development projects in his constituency and ensure that his supporters don’t come under attack in a couple of districts in southern Tamil Nadu. Mr. Karunaas justified withdrawing the notice against the Speaker, contending that given the numbers in favour of the AIADMK in the House, the motion would not have been adopted.|0|
‘Jaya’s residence worth not less than Rs. 100 cr.’|CHENNAI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Madras High Court was on Wednesday surprised to hear that Veda Nilayam, residence of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, at Poes Garden was spread over 10 grounds (around 24,000 sq.ft.) of land with the market value of each ground (2,400 sq.ft.) being nothing less than Rs. 10 crore. A Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and Abdul Quddhose could not contain its surprise when advocate S.L. Sudarsanam, representing Jayalalithaa’s nephew J. Deepak, asserted that the Poes Garden property was spread over 10 grounds of land. The submission was made during the hearing of a civil case filed by two AIADMK cadre for appointment of an administrator to take care of the movable as well as immovable properties left behind by the former Chief Minister. The court hadsuo motuincluded her nephew as well as niece, J. Deepa, as respondents to the case. It also directed them to submit a complete list of properties owned by their aunt. Mr. Sudarsanam said his client wanted to adopt the list of properties declared by his aunt before contesting the 2016 Assembly elections. Discrepancies in list When questioned about the Kodanad estate, he said it was owned by a partnership firm in which his client’s aunt, her aide V.K. Sasikala, Ilavarasi and one more person were partners. However, finding that there were discrepancies in the list of properties declared during elections and those that found place in the Supreme Court judgement in a disproportionate assets case, the judges impleaded the Principal Chief Commissioner of Income Tax too as a respondent to the case so that her tax returns could be analysed. A.P. Srinivas, senior standing cousel for the I-T Department, was asked to take notice and submit details of assets and liabilities declared by Jayalalithaa during her lifetime. Further, since the State government was contemplating to convert the Poes Garden residence into a memorial, the judges ordered notice to the government, returnable by Monday.|0|

Special Deputy Collector under court scanner|CHENNAI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Madras High Court has directed Chennai Collector to conduct a detailed inquiry to find out whether a Special Deputy Collector had colluded with a private individual last year and handed over a compensation of Rs. 25.79 lakh for land acquisition though there was a dispute over the ownership of the property that was acquired. Justice V. Bharathidasan pointed out that the land had been acquired for the purpose of construction of a bridge at Porur here. Since there was a serious dispute over its ownership between two groups, the Special Deputy Collector had initially ordered that the compensation should be deposited before the jurisdictional civil court. However, this order was suddenly changed on November 30, 2017, and the money was ordered to be paid to one of the two groups. No power to review order Holding that such a change in stance was ex facie illegal and without jurisdiction, the judge said the Special Deputy Collector, Land Acquisition, lacked the power to review his own order. After setting aside the subsequent order, the judge directed the Collector to recover the amount from the group to which it was paid and deposit it in the civil court concerned. Simultaneously, an inquiry should be conducted to find out if there was a collusion so that appropriate criminal complaint could be lodged against erring officials.|0|
Dignity march to end sexual violence reaches Chennai|Chennai|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Dignity March organised by the Rashtriya Garima Abhiyan to end sexual violence against women and children reached the city on Wednesday.

Law college students assault MTC bus crew|CHENNAI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Bus services on Rajiv Gandhi Salai were disrupted for more than three hours after bus drivers and conductors of the Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) went on a flash strike demanding action against students of the government law college who assaulted a member of their crew on Wednesday. Trouble started when a student travelling in MTC bus no.102 cut proceeding from Broadway to Siruseri IT Park refused to take a bus ticket, saying he was a college student. When the conductor asked him to show the student identification card, he did not and picked up an argument with him. When the conductor stopped the bus and asked the student to get down, he, along with his accomplices, assaulted the conductor and time keeper Elumalai. When the news of the assault on the MTC crew members spread, bus drivers and conductors stopped buses abruptly on Siruseri Road, forcing commuters to get down. An official of the MTC said senior officials along with the local police held talks with the striking drivers and conductors to get back to work. But they refused to withdraw the strike until the students were arrested.

Sasikala’s counsel slams Law Minister|CHENNAI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Counsel for V.K. Sasikala, the jailed aide of late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, has cast aspersions on Tamil Nadu Law Minister C.Ve. Shanmugam’s demand for an independent probe into Jayalalithaa’s death, and raised doubts whether he is trying to influence the Justice (Retd.) A. Arumughaswamy Commission. Slamming the demand of the Law Minister, N. Raja Senthoor Pandian, Sasikala’s lawyer, told the media on Wednesday that it was Sasikala who brought a doctor from the U.S., Shameem Sharma, on 25 November 2016, who suggested an angiogram be performed on her. “He saw the reports and noticed fluctuations. In fact, he met Ms. Jayalalithaa and took her permission (for the angio). She accepted it,” Mr. Pandian said. However, doctors at Apollo and Dr. Richard Beale suggested it was not advisable then, he said. Mr. Pandian also wondered how the affidavit of the standing counsel for the Commission, Mohammed Jafarullah Khan’s petition was leaked to the media. “His petition is unnumbered, and I came to know about it only now.” “I hope the Commission will not bow down to the pressure. If a Law Minister talks about this, this raises doubts on whether there is external pressure on the Commission,” Mr. Pandian said, adding that AIADMK leaders such as D. Jayakumar, C. Ve. Shanmugam, Nirmala Periasamy, and Dindigul Sreenivasan must be summoned “since they have been giving bytes regularly to the media on her hospitalisation”. Doctor objects It is also learnt that Madhan Kumar, who objected to the Commission’s notation on his deposition, submitted a petition to the authority, putting in writing his objections. He had appeared on November 29 to provide testimony on the treatment provided to Jayalalithaa. Questioned about the sternotomy procedure performed on her after she suffered a heart attack, he had said that the procedure to open the chest and the ‘cardiac massage’ to revive her was done simultaneously, and the exact duration of each step was difficult to predict. Changes noted However, when he was given a copy of the deposition, he found it had recorded him as saying the massage was stopped after 5-10 seconds, and he made some changes, rewriting it to match his deposition. Dr. Madhan Kumar claimed since they refused to make the changes, he had to leave without signing the note. Subsequent efforts made to alter the written deposition that he claimed was contrary to the facts in the matter also failed. He also objected to another statement in a petition filed by the Standing Counsel for the Commission, about cessation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation resulting in brain death. His petition submitted that the changes suggested by him be properly incorporated in the Commission’s official documentation.|0|
Veda Nilayam to be acquired under new law|CHENNAI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Veda Nilayam, the residence of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa in Poes Garden, will be the first property to be acquired by the State under the provisions of the new land acquisition Act, said Chennai Collector A. Shanmuga Sundaram. Speaking at a public consultation on the acquisition of the property on Wednesday, Mr. Sundaram said the process would be completed in six months. The notification of social impact assessment is required under Section 4 and Sub Section 1 of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, and Rule 6 of T.N. Rules 2017. He said other properties in the vicinity would not be acquired for the memorial. Residents of Poes Garden, however, have opposed the proposal to convert the residence of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa into a memorial. Representatives from 20 residents’ associations participated, opposing the land acquisition. Some residents from other parts of the city participated in the meeting and demanded speedy completion of the process of land acquisition. The project area is located in block number 31 in Mylapore Taluk, covering an extent of 10 grounds and 322 sq.ft.|0|

Monsoon ends, winter sets in Chennai|CHENNAI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The northeast monsoon has ended in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry on Wednesday and dry weather will continue to prevail over the State till the weekend, according to the India Meteorological Department. Winter conditions have set in over Chennai and January is considered the coldest month of the year as the city’s average minimum temperature is around 21.2 degrees Celsius. Lower temperature The weather stations in Nungambakkam and Meenambakkam have recorded a minimum temperature of 20.2 degrees Celsius and 19.3 degrees Celsius respectively on Wednesday, which is nearly two degrees Celsius lower than the normal.

Pay Rs. 2.5 lakh to massage therapist: HC|CHENNAI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Stressing the need for instilling confidence among foreigners that a strong judicial system exists in the country, the Madras High Court on Wednesday directed the State government to pay a compensation of Rs. 2.5 lakh to a female Indonesian massage therapist for infringement of her personal liberty and reputation. Justice N. Anand Venkatesh ordered that the compensation should be paid through the consulate and recovered in equated monthly instalments from the salary of K. Natarajan, Inspector of the Neelankarai police station, for having detained her for 26 days after booking a case against her employer under the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act of 1956.

‘Linguistic and religious pluralism promoted by Gandhi saved the nation’|COIMBATORE|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The linguistic and religious pluralism promoted by Mahatma Gandhi has saved the nation and made India different from other European and Asian countries, said noted historian and author Ramachandra Guha in Coimbatore on Wednesday. To highlight the cause of linguistic pluralism, Gandhi started ‘Indian Opinion’, the first multilingual newspaper in the world, he said. “To be a patriotic Indian, one need not have to be a Hindu, do not have to speak Hindi or do not have to hate Pakistan. This diversity has fully saved us. South Africa taught Gandhi to respect the linguistic and religious diversity and that is how he created a nation that does not define citizenship by religion or language,” said Mr. Guha at the 150th birth anniversary celebration of the Father of the Nation organised by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan (Coimbatore Kendra), Shanti Ashram, and the Committee of Hosts comprising 50 organisations.  B.K. Krishnaraj Vanavarayar, Chairman of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan (Coimbatore Kendra), conferred the ‘Defender of Peace Award- 2019’ on Ela Gandhi, peace activist and granddaughter of Mahatma Gandhi, on behalf of Shanthi Ashram and Sarvodaya Movement at the event. “In the materialistic world that we live in, the messages of Gandhi are being discarded and people criticise him for the person he was rather than his ideas, eventually leading to the loss of his ideas. If we look within ourselves, we can find those values of compassion, empathy and understanding,” said Ms. Gandhi, also member of the Religious Affairs Committee of South Africa, after accepting the award. She dedicated the award to all the people who helped and sacrificed their lives for a good cause. Kesav Desi Raju, former secretary, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, and grandson of S. Radhakrishnan, former President of India, said that Gandhi belonged to every one, irrespective of he/ she being a Gandhian or historian or citizen of India or any other country. “It may be 150 years since Mahatma has gone, but he still lives within us,” he said. Kezevino Aram, President, Shanti Ashram, spoke about the ‘Defender of Peace Award’. ‘Mahatma Gandhi Spirit of Service Award’ was conferred on K. Kulandaivelu, former Chancellor, Avinashilingam Deemed University, N. Markandan, former Vice-Chancellor, Gandhigram Deemed University, V. P. Kalimuthu, freedom fighter; C.S. Ramakrishnan, Gandhian activist, K.A. Subramaniam, Chairman, Gandhiadigal Kalvi Niruvanam, M. Vannikkalai, founder of Gandhi Seva Sangam, N. R.

District administration reaches compromise with land owners|Coimbatore|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Talks by Minister for Municipal Administration S.P. Velumani and officials with the land owners in SIHS Colony for land acquisition which had been dragging for seven years ended on a positive note on Tuesday. A proposal for constructing a bridge across the railway level crossing was mooted in 2010 and on October 26, 2012, tenders were floated for the project at a cost of Rs. 21.16 crore. A service road was planned on either side of the bridge. Even when the constructions were nearing 80 %, the project hit a stalemate over compensation for the lands to be acquired for the service road. The land owners obtained a stay from the Madras High Court on April 28, 2014 which said that works could continue after paying the compensation due to the land owners, thus halting the works. On Tuesday, the Minister, district administration, Corporation and Highway officials held talks with the land owners. The talks concluded with the land owners agreeing to accept the due/reasonable compensation. The quantum of compensation would be notified in the GO and Gazette shortly, the officials said. A release from the Collectorate said that as per the court guidelines, disbursement of compensation would be worked out and would be informed to the court by the both parties, thus enabling the vacation of the stay. This would result in works to resume. The bridge would serve as a connecting link between the two busy Avanashi and Tiruchi Roads and vehicles that wait at the level crossing for 72 times a day could be avoided.|0|

Peacock menace haunts Karaikal farmers|Karaikal|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|At a time when farmers in Karaikal expect a good paddy yield in the current season after receiving Cauvery water, they are faced with a peculiar problem: rampant peacock menace. Farmers of T. R Pattinam, Neravvy, Keezhakasakudi, Mela Keezhakasudi and Pillaitheruvasal are struggling to keep the birds at bay which stray in large numbers into the paddy fields in search of worms and insects, thereby completely damaging the crops. According to Arogyadas, a farmer in Pillaithiruvasal, the peafowl population had multiplied in large numbers. “Three to four years ago, there were only a handful of peacocks in the area. “But the number had increased as peacocks start breeding from an young age,” he said. Varadarajan, another farmer from the locality, said they were also worried that the birds may perish as the fields are sprayed with pesticides. “We will be made accountable for the incident. We are now chasing the bird away but the damage to the crop has already been done,” he said. The President of the Karaikal Region Farmers Welfare P. Rajendran said the forest department should use its resources to redeploy the peacocks into the forest area.  If the department does not act now, the population of the bird will increase further and then it would be difficult to manage the situation, he added. Cultivation hit “Some forty years ago, there were around 12,000 hectares of paddy under cultivation in Karaikal. Now, it has come down to 6,000 hectares. If issues were not addressed people may stop cultivation resulting in further dip in paddy production,” he said. Borewell construction Mr Rajendran also demanded the relaxation of government rule giving permission for the construction of borewells. Presently, borewells were allowed to be constructed 6 km away from the coast. Farmers who have constructed borewells in the stipulated distance were not able to draw adequate water. The distance should be relaxed to 4 km, he said.|0|

‘Consumption-based credit system useful’|MADURAI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Former Deputy Governor R. Gandhi on Wednesday called for a consumption-based financial credit system, covering areas such as housing, health, education, marriage and birth and death, that would be effective in alleviating the status of small and medium farmers. Consumption was part of everyday life, and social events often became major expenditure for rural households, he pointed out. “The financial policy has been anti-consumption finance. Economies in the United States have followed a purely consumption-based model and thrived. India need not go to extremes but can look into providing long-term housing loans for creation of pucca structures. We also need to change the mindset of people seeking health insurance through provision of incentives,” he said. Mr. Gandhi was speaking at the inauguration of a 11-day rural immersion programme for students of Thiagarajar School of Management by DHAN Foundation. Mr. Gandhi said microfinances and cooperatives, which often provided last mile connectivity, should be empowered through the government. Marginal households would be helped through livelihood enhancement, production credit, consumption finance, micro savings and micro insurances. Calling the students to dive deep into the immersion programme and gain solid and practical understanding of the status of the villages surrounding their habitat, he said the programme was going to provide everyone a platform to experience and observe rural and development dimensions. M. P. Vasimalai, Executive Director, DHAN Foundation, shared the experience of the Vinoba Boodan movement and spoke about how each community had the capacity and knowledge to overcome its problems. A total of 120 students would be trained over 11 days, organisers said.|0|

This was after he decided to end his life by consuming rat poison at his village near Kamuthi in Ramanathapuram district. He died on December 30, said Mr. Shanmugasundaram. On Sunday, the family members opposed conduct of autopsy because they suspected foul play in the death. The procedure was stalled on Wednesday for a couple of hours since a clarification was sought before the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court over the doctors engaged to perform the autopsy. Justice B. Pugalendhi gave the go-ahead after the GRH Dean (in-charge) submitted that two associate professors of Forensic Medicine from the Theni medical college would conduct the autopsy along with senior professors of the GRH. Assistance for overcoming suicidal thoughts is available on the State’s health helpline 104 and Sneha’s suicide prevention helpline 044-24640050.|0|
Can’t stop DGP from discharging duties: HC|MADURAI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Wednesday refused to pass interim orders restraining Director General of Police T.K. Rajendran, whose name figures in the gutkha scam, from discharging his official duties. The court directed the State to file within two weeks its counter to a public interest litigation petition that sought a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation into certain missing documents in the gutkha scam. A Division Bench of Justices K. K. Sasidharan and P. D. Audikesavalu adjourned the case for further hearing till January 21. The petitioner had sought a direction to restrain Mr. Rajendran from discharging his official duties till investigation in the scam was completed. The petitioner, K. Kathiresan, a member of the AITUC, Madurai, questioned the appointment of Mr. Rajendran to the post of DGP. He pointed out that searches by Income Tax department officials in the gutka scam had exposed high-ranking police officers, including Mr. Rajendran. Given the serious nature of allegations raised against Mr. Rajendran and in view of the fact that investigation was pending in the case, he should not be allowed to discharge his official duties. The government order issued for Mr. Rajendran’s appointment as DGP must be set aside, he said.|0|

‘Will strive to bring MKU back to its old glory’|MADURAI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|M. Krishnan, who took charge as the 17th Vice-Chancellor of Madurai Kamaraj University on Wednesday, said he would strive to bring the university back to its old glory. Addressing the media after assuming charge, he said he would not hesitate to take action against any existing irregularities in the university. “Governor Banwarilal Purohit has asked me to first observe the functioning of the university for a month to understand why there were so many complaints and issues. The idea is not to be punitive, but issues will certainly be weeded out,” he said. Pointing out that he was from Nagamalai Pudukkottai (the area where the university is located) and got his Ph. D. from the MKU itself, he said the university that was a frontrunner once had become issue-ridden over the years. “In the National Assessment and Accreditation Council assessment, the university has a score of only 3.08 now. An institution needs a score of at least 3.25 to offer courses through distance education. Receiving funds from the Ministry of Human Resource Development will become difficult if the score is less than 3.5,” he said. Mr. Krishnan said his strategy to put the university on a growth path would focus on six areas, including attracting more students through better infrastructure; job opportunities and new courses; improving quality of teaching in collaboration with international faculty and improving research output by ensuring better laboratory and library infrastructure. He said the other focus areas would be ensuring governance with transparency and integrity, environmental friendly initiatives and providing consultancy based on the university’s research expertise. Stating that there was a need for receiving more funds from government agencies for all development initiatives, he said special attention would be given on that front. “Fortunately, I have the experience of serving in committees of NAAC, University Grants Commission and the Department of Science and Technology, which, I hope, will be of help,” he added. He appealed for cooperation from the university staff and the public to achieve the objectives. “I will not disappoint the Governor and others who have trust in me in delivering the best for the university,” he said.|0|

Dalit colony reinstated with panchayat after 12 years|MADURAI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|A 12-year wait for residents of a Dalit colony in Aruppukottai ended on Wednesday after the State submitted before the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court that it was re-instated with Sukkilanatham panchayat, thereby restoring government welfare schemes to them. The State submitted that both Ambedkar Colony and Narikuravar Colony were re-instated with Sukkilanatham panchayat and a Gazette notification was issued bringing the order to effect. A Division Bench of Justices K.K. Sasidharan and P.D. Audikesavalu observed that the State government should have taken the step much earlier. The court had sought appearance of the Principal Secretary, Rural Development and Panchayat Raj, if no steps were taken in the case. The court was hearing a public interest litigation petition filed in 2010 by K. Samuelraj of Tamil Nadu Untouchability Eradication Front. The petitioner complained that the people of Ambedkar Colony were marginalised over want of jurisdiction. He said that the colony was part of Sukkilanatham panchayat. In 2007, the then panchayat president refused to collect property tax from residents, claiming that they were part of Aruppukottai Municipality. Hence, there was no jurisdiction for the panchayat to collect the tax for houses built under the Group House Scheme. Aruppukottai Municipality also did not collect tax since the colony did not fall under its jurisdiction. Unable to pay the tax, the residents were made to run from pillar to post and were subsequently denied government welfare schemes. He sought a direction to restore the government welfare schemes to residents and put an end to discrimination and victimisation. Taking into account the plight of the people, the court had earlier directed the authorities to restore basic amenities to the colony.|0|
Veterinarians begin issuing fitness certificates for jallikattu bulls|MADURAI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Ahead of jallikattu season, veterinarians began issuing fitness certificates for bulls in hospitals and dispensaries across Madurai district on Wednesday. Joint Director of Animal Husbandry R. Rajasekaran said the animal’s height and weight would be checked during inspection. “The animal should be at least 120 cm tall below its hump region,” he said. It would also have to be at least 2.5 years old and should have milch teeth. Also, if the animal was over 10 years, it would be rejected. The animals would be checked for disease, illness, injuries and wounds, he added. A doctor from Alanganallur said it was common to reject animals if they had a blood parasite, or if they were weak. “The horn should not be mutilated and the tail should not be cut. Only then can we provide a fitness certificate,” he said. The certificates would be provided for the next six months at 91 dispensaries, seven veterinary hospitals, one polyclinic and one mobile clinic. More such inspections would take place on the day of registration. “A 10-member team from the Indo-Tibetan Border Police Force will also assist us on the day of the first jallikattu,” he said.|0|
Plastic ban: officials begin inspection|MADURAI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The district administration and City Corporation on Wednesday took part in a series of raids and awareness initiatives throwing light on the State government’s plastic ban that came into effect on January 1. Collector S. Natarajan went to several areas, including Tirupparankundram, Paravai, Chekkanurani and Nagamalai, accompanied by a team consisting of members from revenue and police departments and the Corporation and conducted raids. The team visited shops around Subramanya Swamy temple and enlightened shopkeepers about switching over to cloth bags. “The life of single-use plastic barely lasts a few minutes,” Mr. Natarajan said. People must make the move to indigenous and environmentally friendly methods at the earliest, he added. The Collector also distributed cloth bags to passers-by. Mr. Natarajan also inspected shops at Chekkanurani Bus Stop and appealed to travellers to use cloth bags. He appreciated shopkeepers who used banana leaves as packaging material in Paravai and addressed students of S. Vellaichamy Nadar College in Nagamalai. Meanwhile, a civic team comprising assistant commissioners, sanitary officers, inspectors, Swachh police and volunteers inspected shops across different zones. A press statement said a total of 781 shops were inspected and 41 fined Rs. 20,500 for continuing to use plastic. A total of 462 kg was seized. Many shops continued to use non-woven bags and some shopkeepers complained that sanitary workers often seized plastic items not listed by the government.|0|
Dhinakaran moves SC seeking ‘pressure cooker’ symbol|NEW DELHI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam leader T.T.V. Dhinakaran on Wednesday moved the Supreme Court, seeking a direction to the Election Commission to allot the 'pressure cooker' symbol to his party for the Tiruvarur bypoll. Mr. Dhinakaran, represented by senior advocate A.M. Singhvi, orally mentioned his plea before a Bench led by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi. The court agreed to list the case on January 7 after Mr. Dhinakaran said the last date for filing nominations was January 10. Meanwhile, a resident of Tiruvarur constituency separately moved the top court, seeking to defer the election till a situation of normalcy was restored in the region, which had been suffering in the aftermath of Cyclone Gaja. Marimmuthu, the petitioner, said voters had lost their voter identity cards in the natural calamity and the court should intervene to protect their right to vote. Lack of facilities The petitioner cited the severe lack of facilities in what was one of the areas worst hit by the cyclone. The storm left a trail of destruction, damaging huts, crops and houses of thousands. The Election Commission has announced the election date as January 28. The counting of votes would be on January 31. The election would be completed on February 2. ‘Relief work to be hit’ The Centre has announced Rs. 1,143 crore as relief for Gaja-affected areas. When the model code of conduct is in force, the Centre or State cannot announce any new schemes or projects. This would further affect relief operations, the petitioner said.|0|
Plastic retailers down shutters in Krishnagiri|KRISHNAGIRI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Plastic bag retailers organised under a yet-to-be-registered Krishnagiri District and Town Plastic Manufacturers and Traders Association downed shutters on Wednesday, launching an indefinite strike protesting against the ban on single-use plastics in the State. The town’s plastic retailers are less amused. According to Sharad Kumar, who handles his father’s plastic retail business that included plastic tumblers, plastic covers and other now-banned items, the ban has not addressed solid waste management. “Countries like China imports plastic waste for recycling into other products. We are only asking that the government invest in solid waste management instead of banning plastics.” The ban will be ineffective, because it does not address chocolate wrappers, biscuits packets that come with less than 10 microns inner packaging, and other items by large corporates. But, smaller cottage units that will need these smaller plastic wrappings will be hit, says Mr. Kumar. Town has less plastic manufacturers, but a large number of retailers, who claim to be affected by the ban. “We don’t know about what other associations are demanding. We retailers in Krishnagiri town demand that the focus should be on solid waste segregation and not a blanket ban. When the 50 micron rule came for plastics, we stopped manufacturing or trading in less than 50 micron plastics. But, it continued in circulation because it was manufactured inside various lanes without scrutiny,” he says. On Wednesday, just as the monthly purchases for household provisions commenced, a number of consumers, who had forgotten to carry their own bags were seen requesting for the polypropylene bags that were in use until last week. The ubiquitous polypropylene bags with the partial feel of a light cloth bag and were seen as an alternative to plastic carry bags would elicit a spot fine of Rs. 10,000, says Paul Vincent, proprietor of Paulsons departmental store, the largest store in the town. “The officials said, it has a mix of nylon, and therefore not biodegradable. We had put up posters urging customers to get their own bags since November. Customers were made aware of the ban, thanks to the visual media,” says Mr. Vincent. Plastic and paper cups, plastic sheets as table covers, plastic plates, plastic coated tumblers, plastic straws, plastic flags, plastic water pouches are among the banned plastic items, according to the pamphlets distributed by Krishnagiri municipality. However, there appears to be significant confusion on the parameters that attracts the ban. “Black garbage bags are allowed for sale. Similarly, milk and curd packaged in plastic packets are permitted.” While water packets are banned, there is no clarity on water bottles, especially the smaller 500 ml bottles, says a restaurant manager pointing to his refrigerator stacked with water bottles of all sizes. According to Babu, manager of Mangalam, a popular non-vegetarian restaurant, a considerable number of customers were turned away on New Year’s day because they hadn’t carried their own bags or food carriers for take away home orders. “Customers assumed we would provide them with alternatives. Quite a few orders were not taken because customers had no carry bags to carry their large orders.”|0|

Weighbridge commissioned|TIRUCHI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|With the commissioning of a weighbridge, a long-felt need of tribal farmers of Top Sengattupatti on Pachamalai Hills was met on Wednesday. The farmers have been demanding the weigh bridge to minimise exploitation by middlemen purchasing tapioca. Farmers have been alleging that the traders and middlemen have been squandering their due by following dubious method in weighing tapioca with old and unchecked scales. The demand topped their grievances whenever Tiruchi Collector visited Pachamalai. When Collector K. Rajamani made his maiden visit in June 2017 to Pachamalai after assuming office, they impressed upon him the need to take steps to prevent interference of middlemen in fixing the price for tapioca, which is a major crop raised in Pachamalai, a row of low range hills, a part of the Eastern Ghats in Tiruchi district. He assured that their demand would be considered positively. He took up the issue with the Secretary and Director of Rural Development Department when he attended the conference of Collectors in Chennai and subsequently Rs. 20 lakh was sanctioned by the Rural Development Department controlled Panagal Building Society for erecting weighbridge at Pachamalai. Mr. Rajamani, who declared open the weighbridge at Top Sengattupatti, hoped that it would pave the way for breaking the syndicate of traders and middlemen in fixing the prices of tapioca. A nominal charge would be levied for weighing tapioca and other produces of tribal farmers. The rural development, revenue and tribal welfare officials had been asked to monitor the system of tapioca procurement from tribal farmers.|0|

Fish vendor’s action comes in for praise|Ramanathapuram|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|A fish vendor received appreciation for discarding throwaway plastic carry bags and using paper to pack fish after the State-wide ban on single use plastic items came into force on January 1. Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao, who inspected shops, markets, restaurants, bakeries and other commercial establishments on Wednesday, was pleasantly surprised when he found the fish vendor positively responding to the ban. He appreciated his gesture and exhorted other vendors in the fish market to either insist the consumers to bring vessels to buy fish or make available vessels to the consumers for a price. “The response is very good and people are keen on stop using the 14 plastic items identified by the government in the ban order,” he said. Except in a bakery where he found a large number of unwoven carry bags, which were also banned, most of the shops and vendors had complied with the government order, he said. As usage of plastic in the pre-packed items was less, people should not use the widely used 14 items, which were harmful to the environment and largely contributed to plastic pollution, he said. As people had been accustomed to these items all these years, he has asked the officials to educate the public on the ill effects of single use plastics instead of acting tough. “The focus is not to trouble people but make them understand the issue and come forward to enforce the ban,” Mr. Rao said. He said officials in 37 teams would visit all the taluk and block headquarters in urban and rural local bodies and monitor the ban. The officials had been asked to seize the banned items, wherever they were in use, he said. Shopkeepers and vendors had been asked to install boards asking customers to bring their cloth bags and vessels, he added. Mr. Rao later visited Rameswaram and monitored the enforcement of the ban by visiting shops and markets. Accompanied by officials, he walked through the entire stretch from Goswami Mutt to the Ramanathaswamy Temple, asking people to stop using the banned items.|0|

Mixed response to ban on single-use plastic products|THOOTHUKUDI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Checks for the banned single-use plastic items started in Thoothukudi on Wednesday, with around 1.4 tonnes of plastic products being seized within the Corporation limits. Inspections were conducted at 780 shops by 14 teams of officials in the city. Besides plastic carry bags and other materials, non-woven bags made of polypropylene and aluminium foil were also seized. However, fines were not slapped on the violators of the ban. A Corporation official said the shopkeepers did not protest, and instead asked for alternatives that could be used. They were told to use cloth bags. Following the local ban on single-use plastics, which came into force on August 15, 2018 within the Corporation limits, many people had switched to non-woven polypropylene bags and aluminium foil packaging, which are also not allowed. In Kovilpatti, around one tonne of plastic products were seized on Wednesday. Shops, including bakeries andkadalamittaishops, which protested against the ban and sought more time for shifting from plastic packaging materials, downed their shutters. A municipal official said widespread awareness campaigns had been carried out over the past several months. The enforcement would continue, he added. Similar seizures were made at various other places in the district. Students took a pledge to get rid of single-use plastics at most of the 1,834 schools in the district, after a circular was issued by the Department of School Education in this regard. Nine teams, comprising 10 members each, were deployed by Tirunelveli Corporation to check for use of plastics. Officials seized plastic items in all the four zones – Tirunelveli, Thachanallur, Melapalayam and Palayamkottai. Meanwhile, members of Plastic Manufacturers and Traders Association shut 15 shops within the Corporation limits, and around 125 shops across the district. They also staged a demonstration in the city, led by president Veeramuthu, demanding the revocation of the ban.|0|
High Court moots common syllabus across boards|Madurai|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has suggested a common syllabus for schools across the country. The government should introspect on the need for a uniform syllabus across boards so that one group does not march over the other. Also a centralised database of online study materials and knowledge of jobs could be created to benefit children, apart from career guidance cells, the court said. Besides, it suggested that yoga be introduced to help students cope with stress. A Division Bench of Justices S. Vimala and T. Krishnavalli observed that the present education system was having a telling effect on the well-being of the student community. The attention that students must be receiving from parents and teachers was lacking, the court said, after taking cognisance of the recommendations submitted by a court-appointed expert panel appointed to study the current educational scenario. The court said not sorting out the issue could lead to adverse effects. Though steps were initiated by the government, a competitive environment would not allow young minds to be at ease. “Education should be a knowledge gaining mechanism rather than just an employment generator. Education could be more of fun rather than run,” the judges observed. The court observed that steps must be initiated by parents, teachers and the government alike to effectively reduce stress. Influence of family, school, college and outer environment have profound influence on students’ abilities. Schools are looking more at producing results than ensuring the well-being of the child. Teachers could be given psychological training so that they could counsel students. Abuse, ragging Technology and exhibitions could be used effectively to help children. Girl students should be made aware of Vishaka committee (internal complaints committee). Abuse and ragging must be ended effectively. Psychiatrists and academic experts could be engaged at school level to help children, the court said. Habeas corpus case The court was hearing a habeas corpus case filed by a man after his college-going daughter went missing. During the hearing, the court was told that the girl, apprehensive over her performance in college exam, decided to run away. She returned after her father submitted to the court that he would not question her for the performance in the examination.|0|
Meet puts spotlight on gender equality|PUDUCHERRY|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Pondicherry University Vice-Chancellor Prof. Gurmeet Singh has urged the student community to gain awareness about women’s rights and put into practice gender justice. Addressing a seminar on ‘Gender Sensitisation for Gender Justice’ hosted by the Centre for Women’s Studies in coordination with School of Law of the University, Prof. Singh observed that gender justice began at home in the way we treat our immediate kin. The event was organised to raise gender awareness among the students of Pondicherry University. The Vice-Chancellor also distributed certificates and cash awards to the winners of the “Competition for University students on laws related to women” conducted under the aegis of the National Commission for Women, New Delhi. C. Aruna, Head (i/c), Centre for Women’s Studies, dwelt on the significance of promoting gender sensitisation for attaining gender justice. She also stressed on the importance of disseminating legal awareness. Human rights Prof. Gulam Dasthagir, in his concept note, pointed out how gender analysis of social justice assumes primacy in understanding women’s rights as human rights. Social legislations can be instrumental in promulgating, percolating and enforcing gender justice. Gender sensitisation programmes of this kind lend credence to capacity building among the educated youth in preparing them to engage in advocacy, research, consultancy and awareness campaigns in recasting society with gender justice, he said. Dr. Subhalakshmi of the School of Law underscored the relevance of promoting legal awareness about women’s rights for a gender just society.|0|
Yercaud residents seek post-mortem facility at government taluk hospital|SALEM|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The residents of the innumerable tribal villages on the Yercaud hills and various organisations have urged the government to set up post-mortem facility at the Government Taluk Headquarters Hospital in Yercaud town with immediate effect. In the absence of the post-mortem facility, the local community, a majority of them belonging to weaker sections, have to spend much for taking the bodies of accident victims etc to the Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College Hospital, situated in the city for autopsy. A cross-section of the people say that all the taluk hospitals in the district have post-mortem facility and the Yercaud taluk hospital was the only exception. The relatives have to bear the expenses for transporting the bodies to the medical college hospital for autopsy. Besides, they have to wait for a long time before getting the body and take it back to their respective villages. The poor tribal people have to spend much for this exercise and they could not afford the same. Needs equipment They say that there are adequate doctors at Yercaud hospital and infrastructure for conducting the post-mortem. Necessary equipment alone were needed for the introduction of the facility. The people say that the Health Department could procure the needed instruments from the National Rural Health Mission or under the MP / MLA Local Area Development Fund. G. Chitra, MLA of Yercaud constituency, has taken up the matter of creating post-mortem facility with the state health department. The MLA presented a petition to the State Assembly Public Undertakings Committee headed by S. Semmalai, MLA, during its recent sitting at the Salem Collectorate demanding introduction of post-mortem at the Yercaud hospital. When contacted, department sources toldThe Hinduthat the petition will be forwarded to the higher-ups for favourable consideration. The residents of the hill station and the surrounding villages are happy that the Department of Public Health and Preventive Medicine introduced the facility of registration of the births and deaths at the Yercaud taluk GH, a couple of months ago. The Yercaud hills accounted for three primary health centres at Nagalur, Manjakuttai and Vaazhavanthi villages with all infrastructure facilities.|0|

The victim is unlikely to continue her studies as she was one of the seven children – three girls and four boys – in the family and her siblings had dropped out, the officials said. The victim was taking care of her father, who is undergoing treatment in the hospital after fracturing his leg in an accident, when the accused, M. Saravanan, an employee of a bakery located in front of the hospital, lured and raped her after taking her to a toilet inside the hospital complex. Awareness campaign As the incident took place inside the hospital, visited by scores of women and children, the CPU has decided to launch an awareness campaign on the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POSCO) Act, 2012, the officials said. “We are also planning to display signboards warning of stringent punishment for sexual abuse of women and children,” they said. Meanwhile, Town All Women Police arrested the accused under Sections 366 (kidnap) and 376 (3) (rape) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 4 (penetrative sexual assault) of the POCSO Act. Saravanan was produced before a magistrate court and remanded in judicial custody on Wednesday, police sources said.|0|

Buses on wrong lane scare motorists|TIRUCHI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Driving on the wrong lane, especially by drivers of mofussil buses, on Anna Nagar Link Road in the city is posing a threat to other road users. The flagrant violation by many mofussil bus crew, including State Transport Corporations and omni buses entering the city, has been putting other road users at great risk between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. The violation is largely due to the failure of the authorities to provide direct access to Lawsons Road at the MGR Statue roundabout even four years after Anna Nagar Link Road was opened for traffic. A separate lane leading towards Lawsons Road on Anna Nagar Link Road has been blocked by the police with barricades to avert traffic congestion at the MGR statue junction. Without this vital link to Lawsons Road, all vehicles coming from Link Road have to necessarily go via the Court Junction to reach the Collector’s office Road through Reynolds Road. Alternatively, motorists heading towards Lawsons Road from Anna Nagar have to go via the Uzhavar Sandhai and Pattabiraman Road to reach the MGR statue junction. Reluctant to take the circuitous options, drivers of several buses take the wrong lane and head straight towards Lawsons Road to reach the Central Bus Stand. They take the wrong lane near the Andakondan Junction, which too has turned a dangerous accident prone spot. Residents blame the Corporation for poor planning of the traffic roundabout at the MGR statue junction and the police for failing to make an automatic signal functional at the junction to regulate the traffic. The corporation had originally planned to shift the statue to a traffic island created at the end of the link road near the district court complex. But the idea was shelved as the shifting of the MGR statue was considered a sensitive issue. Motorists say that the new road without a proper alignment and link to Lawsons Road does not serve its purpose fully. “It has become highly dangerous to proceed towards Anna Nagar after 9.30 p.m. as several mofussil buses take the wrong lane, catching unwary motorists by surprise. It is very scary as the drivers proceed at high speed unmindful of the danger to other road users. As there is a median on the road, motorists do not expect vehicles to come on the wrong lane and many have to swerve at the last minute to avoid hitting the vehicles. The police should allow traffic towards Lawsons Road by installing traffic signals at the MGR Statue Junction,” said N.Jamaludeen, a resident of Anna Nagar. Even by keeping the lane towards Lawsons Road close, there is traffic chaos around the junction as vehicles converge from different directions, Mr.Jamaludeen said and called for steps to streamline traffic flow at the spot. Although the police tried to operate an automatic traffic signal at the junction some time ago, the move was given up within a few days. Residents point out that hundreds of people use the walking track and the gym opened by the Corporation along Link Road till late in the night and early in the morning. “This lane is usually busy with walkers moving about. Buses coming on the wrong lane pose a danger to these people too. It is unfortunate that the police turn a blind eye to the violation even after a bus coming on the wrong lane fatally knocked down a motorcyclist some months ago,” said R.Gopal, another resident. Some suggest that the barricades towards Lawsons Road can at least be removed during nights allowing mofussil buses to head straight.|0|
Kin of missing CRPF jawan stage dharna at Collectorate|TIRUNELVELI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Relatives of a CRPF jawan, who went missing six months ago, staged a dharna at the Collectorate here on Wednesday, seeking the Collector’s intervention to find his whereabouts. N. Annadurai, 36, of Pattu Pillayar Kovil Street in Palayamkottai, a CRPF head constable who had been posted at Gadchiroli in Maharashtra, was transferred to Chandigarh. After coming to Palayamkottai on leave, he boarded a train on June 29 to report for duty in Chandigarh. When his wife A. Deivakani called him the next day, he said his mobile reception was week and messaged his wife on WhatsApp saying he would call her on reaching Chandigarh. It was the last communication she received from him. On July 2, she received a call from Delhi police saying her husband’s luggage was found at a railway police station in the city. It was only then she came to know that her husband had not joined duty in Chandigarh and filed a complaint with Palayamkottai police. She said no action was taken to trace her husband even after they filed complaints with the local police, the CRPF in Delhi and at the Collectorate. Further, she said it had become very difficult to raise her two children, Kanishka and Selvaraj, as Annadurai’s salary was not disbursed as he, who had been in service for 15 years, did not report for duty. After submitting the petition to Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish, BJP district president Dayashankar and farmers’ wing State general secretary Ganeshkumar Adithan said they would send a complaint through fax to Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and take Ms. Deivakani to New Delhi to lodge a complaint.|1|Wednesday
39 kg of plastic carry bags seized|TIRUCHI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Kickstarting the enforcement of plastic ban in the city, corporation officials imposed fine to the tune of Rs. 59,000 on traders who were found holding stocks of use-and-throw plastic products here on Wednesday.

Will get Statehood after Cong. comes to power at Centre: CM|PUDUCHERRY|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The “anti-democratic” and the unconstitutional style of functioning of Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi has prompted the Congress to take to the streets of national capital its battle to obtain Statehood for the Union Territory, Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy has said. The Chief Minister toldThe Hinduthat “no other government in the U.T. has taken such an assertive stand on obtaining Statehood because no other Lieutenant Governor has created so many troubles for an elected government like Ms. Bedi did in the last two-and-a-half years.” The administrative power struggle in the U.T. started after Ms. Bedi took over as L-G. It had brought all major political parties, barring the AINRC and the BJP, on to the same page. Although the AIADMK had decided not to join the protest in New Delhi, the Dravidian party was the first to seek the recall of the Lt. Governor, the Chief Minister said. Exuding confidence in getting Statehood, the Chief Minister said there had been several favourable factors that emerged in the last few years. Govt. staff support The government employees were earlier against getting Statehood because of the 70% grant accorded by the Centre as budgetary support. After the size of this grant accorded by the Centre shrunk to 26%, the employees’ association had changed its stand on Statehood, he said. As an endorsement of U.T.’s demand, the Standing Committee on Home Affairs, which was headed by the present External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, had given a report recommending Statehood for the U.T. Ms. Swaraj, who as Opposition leader in the Lok Sabha during the tenure of United Progressive Alliance government, had visited the U.T. to elicit views of political parties, employees association and other outfits. The committee, in its report, had stated that the U.T. was eligible for full Statehood. Asked whether the non-contiguous geography of U.T. would stand in the way of getting Statehood, the Chief Minister said: “anyway Statehood can be accorded by Constitutional amendment and necessary changes can be made for keeping the four regions together while attaining Statehood. Those issues can be sorted out through deliberations,” the Chief Minister said. When his reaction was sought on the criticism that the Congress had ignored the demand while in power at the Centre, he said: “If the party comes to power (and it will) in 2019, we will definitely accord Statehood.” The Chief Minister said the protest in Delhi would be used as a platform to tell the nation about the problems faced by the elected government because of the “deliberate hindrances,” created by the Lt. Governor.|0|

Modi likely to lay foundation stone for Dhanushkodi line|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to lay the foundation stone for laying a railway line between Rameswaram and Dhanushkodi also when he lays foundation stone for the construction of All India Institutes of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Madurai later this month. Official sources said the Prime Minister is scheduled to launch a host of projects during his Madurai visit in the third week of this month.  Alignment discussed After the government approved the 17-km broad gauge railway line project, costing more than Rs. 200 crore, Divisional Railway Manager Neenu Irryerah met Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao recently with engineers and discussed the project and the possible alignment. Additional DRM Lalit Kumar Mansukhani met Mr. Rao on Wednesday, and discussed the availability of land and acquisition process. The ADRM said two or three options were explored. Mr. Rao said he would give priority to Dhanushkodi railway line and coordinate with the railways in land acquisition to expedite the project. Dhanushkodi was a flourishing town before the cyclone in 1964. The town and railway tracks were destroyed in the cyclone. Since then, trains were being operated only up to Rameswaram. Dhanushkodi remains as a ghost town after the cyclone. The National Highways has laid a road to Dhanushkodi and the proposed rail connectivity would be a boon to lakhs of pilgrims visiting the island. For a majority of the people, a pilgrimage to Rameswaram island is not complete without a visit to Dhanushkodi.|0|

The engineers conducted the inspection, on the request of the Southern Railway, under the supervision of Additional Divisional Railway Manager Lalit Kumar Mansukhani. Chief Bridge Engineer Ravindrababu, who inspected the repair work on December 24, had said that only after engineers from SERI conducted an analysis and gave their opinion, the Southern Railway could fix a timeframe for resuming train services on the bridge after completing the repair work.

The 104-year-old bridge remained shut since December 4. Since then, repair work was going on a war-footing. Presently, the members in the span are being strengthened and the officials are satisfied with the progress of repair work, being carried out under challenging weather conditions, especially when high velocity wind sweeps the area.

Forest dept. places 2 cages to trap leopard|VELLORE|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Forest Department has placed two cages at Chikkanangkuppam village near Vaniyambadi to capture a leopard that was spotted on December 27. The animal could have strayed into human habitation in search of food and it attacked five villagers after a large crowd gathered around it, officials said. Sewa Singh, chief conservator of forests, Vellore circle, said the leopard had not been sighted in the region in the past two days. “We have not found any pug marks. The animal could have moved to another location. But we are taking measures to trap the animal,” he said after visiting the village on Wednesday. “We have placed two cages with baits in Chikkanangkuppam where it was spotted. The village is on the forest fringe, about 2 or 3 km from the reserve forests. We are ready to tranquillise the animal if it is directly spotted. Once captured, we will release it far into the reserve forests,” he said. As the third strategy, the department has formed three to four teams of personnel attached to the Tirupattur Forest Range. The members of the Village Forest Council are helping the teams. “These teams will disturb the animal by way of bursting fire crackers to chase it into the reserve forest area,” he said.|0|
Plea to reopen quarries|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The State BJP unit on Wednesday demanded that the government take earnest steps to reopen granite quarries in the district. Leading a well-attended demonstration at Anna Nagar, Party State secretary R. Srinivasan said the granite quarries in and around the district were closed in 2012. Despite lack of directive from the courts or from the State government, the quarries remained shut without any reason. As a result, lakhs of workers — directly and indirectly — were jobless. The stories narrated by the worker and their families were pathetic and painful. ‘Oral’ order Inquiry showed that the district administration “orally” forced the quarries not to work. Even the government-owned TAMIN remained closed, he said and demanded immediate reopening of the units. Workers representing different associations submitted a memorandum to Collector S. Natarajan seeking his intervention to reopen and rehabilitate the industry. Later, talking to reporters at the Collectorate, the BJP leader said no government could give jobs in this belt and the only solution was to allow the reopening of granite quarries. Out of 175 quarries, 84 were under scanner for violations. Hence, the government could permit the remaining units to function. By setting up a special or a fast track court, the quarries that had allegedly committed irregularities could also be heard and settled in the interest of the workers. By closing down the units, the government could claim to have won over the industry. The BJP would welcome the setting up of a regulatory body to monitor granite operations. The entrepreneurs could come out of the red and banks shall also make good of the debts, Dr. Srinivasan added. The BJP (rural unit) conducted a yatra in Melur, Thiruvathavur, Keelavalavu and other pockets for two days last month to create awareness of the need to reopen the units.|0|
TNPCB rejects Vedanta’s request|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The State argued that the tribunal went outside the four walls of the statute governing its functions to appoint a committee led by former High Court chief justice Tarun Aggarwala to prepare a report in the case. It said the NGT was not a constitutional court liked the Supreme Court to employ unbridled powers to constitute a committee. The committee failed to consider any of the contentions as well as documents while preparing its report. The NGT had, in turn, relied on the committee’s report. “The scientific material and the analysis report on water and air pollution have not even been set out or considered. Thus, effectively, the NGT assumed a non-existent jurisdiction but having done so, failed to exercise it by considering the facts and evidence while arriving at findings. There are no reasons but mere conclusions in the impugned order. It is unfortunate that the NGT has not bestowed adequate and serious consideration on the environmental pollution caused by the respondent’s (Vedanta) unit,” Tamil Nadu argued. ‘Firm flouted norms’ It contended that Vedanta had not been complying with pollution norms, and the situation had deteriorated since 1996. “Far from taking precautionary steps, the unit has willfully flouted norms and caused the present appalling situation where the groundwater contains TDS more than 20 to 40 times the permissible limit,” it said. The appeal questioned the manner in which Vedanta approached the NGT directly when the statutory appeal against the TNPCB order to shut down the plant was pending adjudication before the appellate authority.|0|

High Court imposes costs of Rs. 50,000 on Forest Department|Bengaluru|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The High Court of Karnataka has imposed costs of Rs. 50,000 on the State’s forest authorities for misleading a litigant by initially granting permission to cut trees grown on a coffee estate in Kodagu district and later claiming that he was not the owner of the trees situated on ‘bane’ land as per the laws applicable to certain types of land in Kodagu. However, the court granted an opportunity to the authorities to give a chance to the estate owner to establish rights over the trees, which were cut and auctioned way back in 2014, and later determine whether he is entitled for claiming 90% of Rs. 4.32 crore, the amount realised by the forest authorities by selling the trees in a government depot through an auction during 2014. 2017 order A Division Bench comprising Justice L. Narayana Swamy and Justice P.B. Bajanthri passed the order while allowing an appeal filed by the forest authorities against the single judge’s February 20, 2017 order for considering the plea of Udaya Eshwaran for releasing the amount. The forest authorities, who had initially permitted cutting of trees and then auctioned cut trees, later claimed that he had no right over the trees. Without going into the merits of the case on whether or not the litigant is entitled for claiming the amount realised by auctioning 107 rosewood trees and 507 trees of other species cut from the land bearing survey number 56/3 of Kirudale village of Suntikoppa Nad in Somwarpet taluk of Kodagu district, the court asked the authorities to first decide the issue on the rights over those trees. The court directed the authorities to issue a show-cause notice to the litigant to establish in law that he had rights over the trees as against the claim of the authorities that the ownership of the trees on the litigant’s estate were vested with the government, and pass a speaking order after giving an opportunity of hearing, both written and oral, to the litigant.|0|

Medium of instruction likely to be sahitya sammelana’s plank|Bengaluru|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The order on introducing English-medium classes in 1,000 government schools may become an important point of debate at the 84th Akhila Bharata Kannada Sahitya Sammelana and could dominate the three-day event starting on Friday in Dharwad. Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, who will inaugurate the literary event, may have to face a barrage of questions on this issue. Resolution Upset with the government’s move to introduce English medium, the Kannada Sahitya Parishat had recently convened a meeting of writers, intellectuals, language and legal experts, and activists and resolved to urge the government to drop the decision and cautioned the government of a stir on the lines of the Gokak agitation if it refused to heed to their plea. Chandrashekar Patil, who chaired the 83rd sammelana in Mysuru and will hand over the charge to Jnanpith recipient Chandrashekar Kambar this time, said he would raise the issue during his address and impress upon the parishat to take a final call on the matter. “The government’s stand on the medium of instruction has to be the primary issue of the sammelana,” said Dr. Patil. Chairman of the Kannada Development Authority S.G. Siddaramaiah said it was more important for the parishat to prioritise issues pertaining survival of Kannada and protecting the pride of the language than organising the sammelana. Manu Baligar, president of the parishat, said reports on the government’s stand on the medium of instruction was “shocking”. “When we sought an appointment with Mr. Kumaraswamy, he promised to take a final call on the issue after convening a meeting of Kannada writers and educationists,” he said. “Introducing English as a medium of instruction by the government is not the right move and not desirable. The parishat will not hesitate to take up the issue,” he added.  The government’s stand on the medium of instruction has to be the primary issue of the sammelana.

Shivakumar invites BJP workers in Channapatna to join Congress|Bengaluru|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Amid allegations that the BJP is trying to poach Congress legislators to bring down the coalition government, Water Resources Minister and Congress strongman D.K. Shivakumar welcomed BJP workers in Channapatna to join his party. Channapatna in Ramanagaram district — of which Mr. Shivakumar is the in charge Minister — is represented by Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy in the Assembly. “Many BJP workers and leaders in the taluk have told me they are upset with the self-interested politics of BJP leaders. They have also expressed interest to join the Congress. Those who believe in the Congress’ ideology and are ready to join the party are welcome to join it any day,” he said in a statement.

Order on English medium out, but CM to take a call|Bengaluru|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Although the Department of Primary and Secondary Education issued a Government Order (GO) recently stating that English-medium sections will be opened in 1,000 government schools, the final call on this will be taken by Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy who holds the charge of this department. This comes after several Kannada writers and scholars criticised the move. Recently, the former Chief Minister and chairman of the coordination committee of the coalition government, Siddaramaiah, too had objected to the government move. Order ‘automatic’ Sources in the Chief Minister’s office said Mr. Kumaraswamy had an “open mind” and was willing to listen to the concerns of all stakeholders. “In fact, the Government Order was issued automatically as this was one of the budget promises for the 2018–19 year,” sources said. The GO issued as early as October 26, 2018 states that English-medium sections should be opened in lower primary classes along with Kannada medium. The order states that starting English-medium classes on a pilot basis will ensure that more students will enrol in government schools. According to the order, government schools teaching English medium in upper primary classes and the 276 Karnataka public schools (model schools) should be given preference to start English medium from classes one. English-medium sections will operate in a phased manner. While English medium should begin in class one from the 2019–20 academic year, it will continue progressively grade-wise for every academic year, the GO stated. Placing emphasis on rural areas, the order states that sections should be started in rural areas that have high student enrolment. It directs the department to short-list teachers who are proficient in English and select them to teach in English-medium classes. Teachers to be trained The order also directs the department to conduct a 15-day training and urges the department to develop e-content for this training. The government has set aside a Rs. 14 crore for this purpose.  The State government should go ahead and start English-medium classes. When they are giving permission to private schools to start English-medium classes, how can they deny the same privilege to government schools? Basavaraj Gurikar,president of the Karnataka State Primary School Teachers’ Association  The government’s stand on the medium of instruction is shocking. Introducing English as a medium of instruction is not a right move and not desirable. The Kannada Sahitya Parishat will not hesitate to take up the issue in all its earnestness.

Revanna has said he will transfer those officers who fail to secure good results this year. In a meeting with officers of the Department of Public Instructions and Pre-University Education, Mr. Revanna, who is also Minister in-charge of the district, said he will not tolerate officers responsible for poor results. “If the district fails to secure a good result in PUC and SSLC, I will get the DDPI and the DDPU transferred from the district. The headmasters of the schools which fail to secure good result will also face the same,” he said. Further, he said the government had provided funds to improve basic infrastructure facilities in schools and colleges. “I am ready to provide what facilities schools and colleges require in the district.

High school dropout lands in U.S. with fake work permit|Bengaluru|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|A 30-year-old high school dropout from Goa, who had allegedly managed to land in New York airport with a fake work permit on Sunday, was caught by U.S. immigration officials and deported to Kempegowda International Airport on Tuesday. The accused, Valezio Fernandes, is a resident of Curtorim in south Goa. He has been charged under cheating and forgery by the airport police, and remanded in judicial custody. The police said Valezio claimed to have paid Rs. 2.7 lakh to a tout in Goa for arranging travel documents and a fake work permit issued by a leading pizza company in New York. Using the travel documents, Valezio boarded a flight to New York from KIA on Sunday. However, he was caught by U.S. immigration officials who were told by the company that the work permit was fake. US officials deported Valezio and alerted KIA immigration officials. Valezio told Indian officials that after dropping out from high school, he took a six-month hotel management course in Goa and worked as a cook in a hotel for three years. He then approached Savio Fernandes, a Goa-based travel agent, seeking employment abroad. Savio allegedly assured him a job in the U.S. and arranged the travel documents, including a fake work permit. The airport officials remanded Valezio in judicial custody and are on the lookout for Savio.|0|

People urged to reject BJP in Lok Sabha elections|Chitradurga|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Chitradurga District Congress Committee (DCC) president Fathyarajan has appealed to people to teach a befitting lesson to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the coming Lok Sabha elections for what he said its failure to protect the interests of the common man and farmers in the last four-and-a-half years. Speaking at a meeting of Congress office-bearers here on Wednesday, he said that before the last Lok Sabha elections, the BJP had made several promises to the people of the country, including bringing back black money stashed in accounts of foreign banks. However, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has done nothing except roaming around the world spending public money. Voters in five States where Assembly elections were held have taught a lesson to the BJP by keeping it away from power for its false assurances. In the coming Lok Sabha elections, the entire nation should reject the BJP and give a clear majority for the Congress and its allies. In the State, the Congress had to join hands with the Janata Dal(S) to ensure that the communal BJP stayed away from power. Since there was no majority for the Congress in the Assembly elections, it was inevitable for it to join hands with the Janata Dal(S), he added. Congress City Block president Syed Allabaksh said that the Congress in the district has launched a programme to ensure facilities under different government schemes directly to the people. The people have to submit their applications to avail of the benefits of government schemes along with necessary documents at the Congress office and the leaders would take them to officers concerned to make sure that they get the facilities as early as possible.|0|

This time, focus on Bahubali Panchamaha Vaibhava|MANGALURU|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Mahamastakabhisheka for Lord Bahubali at Ratnagiri in Dharmasthala from February 9 to February 18 will revolve around Bahubali Panchamaha Vaibhava that gives a deeper view of Bahubali. Dharmasthala Dharmadhikari D. Veerendra Heggade told reporters at Dharmasthala on Wednesday that senior Jain munis, Vardhamana Sagarji and Pushtadanta Sagarji, would guide the three-day anointment rituals from February 16. About the Panchamaha Vaibhava, Mr. Heggade said that Jains in general know about the life of Bahubali, while the Vaibhava, spread over five days from February 11, would offer a deeper view of the Lord, from his youth to self-realisation of truth, to generation next. Panchamaha Vaibhava is a change from tradition, Mr. Heggade noted and said that Mahamastakabhisheka is usually offered to the Lord after the traditional Panchakalyana Programme of Jain Tirthankaras. He said that the two senior Acharyas and Sri Charukeerthi Bhattaraka of Sri Kshetra Shravanabelagola have permitted the Heggades to organise religious and cultural programmes — Panchamaha Vaibhava. Both the Acharyas would be visiting Dharmasthala along with their disciples. While it is the second Mahamastakabhisheka at the Kshetra for Vardhaman Sagarji, it would be the first for Pushtadanta Sagarji. These Acharyas would also lead the Santha Sammelan, a multi-religious meet scheduled on February 9 to spread the message of social amity, Mr. Heggade said. The Aagrodhaka procession after special puja at the Sri Chandranatha Swami Basadi on February 9 will kick off the rituals while the Mahamastakabhisheka would start at 8.45 a.m. on February 16 with 1,008 punyamruta kalashas. The Heggade family would offer the first Mahamastakabhisheka followed by other Jain devotees.|0|

‘Consider stipend for endosulfan victims with cancer’|Mangaluru|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The district administration is proposing that the State government grant monthly stipend to endosulfan victims suffering from cancer. During a meeting to review endosulfan victims relief programmes on Wednesday, chaired by Deputy Commissioner Sasikanth Senthil S., it was pointed there are 52 endosulfan victims who are suffering from cancer. These 52 are among the 556 who are not receiving monthly stipend as their disability was less than 25 %. The government was providing a stipend of Rs. 1,500 (for those with disability between 25 and 60 %) and Rs. 3,000 (to those with disability more than 60 %) to 3,519 victims. 4,227 victims There was a total of 4,227 endosulfan victims. All the victims were getting free treatment at government hosptials and in empanelled private hosptials. Mr. Senthil and Zilla Panchayat Chief Executive Officer R.

Creating awareness on saving girl child, women’s rights|Mandya|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|‘Walk for a cause’, a walkathon to create awareness against female foeticide and to promote women’s rights, was organised here on Wednesday. Doctors, around 500 students from different institutions and nursing colleges, members of various NGOs, government employees and volunteers attended the programme organised by the Public Awareness Committee of the Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI). H.P. Manchegowda, District Health Officer, flagged off the programme outside his office and spoke on the importance of protecting the girl child and respecting women’s rights.

It’s all work and no rest for these senior citizens|Bengaluru|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Life after 60 years may be about retirement for some, but not for all. The number of senior citizens seeking jobs to ensure that they are financially independent is on the rise. Out of 2,622 senior citizens who were placed between 2011 and September 2018 by the Nightingales Medical Trust, a majority were employed in admin departments and as supervisors. Other job roles popular among senior citizens include cashiers and accountants Increase in job seekers The trust, since 2011, runs a programme called the Nightingales Job 60 plus which aims to provide employment to senior citizens so that they have job security. The elderly get jobs after registering for job melas or on the job portal. The helpline also has been getting many enquiries regarding job opportunities, according to trust officials. S. Premkumar Raja, co-founder of Nightingales Medical Trust said companies were willing to give senior citizens supervisory and admin roles as they do not tend to change their jobs frequently. Mr. Raja said there has been an increase in the number of senior citizens seeking jobs as many of them do not have financial security. “About 88% of the aged in our country are not covered under any adequate social security scheme. Therefore, most of them are economically insecure and need to depend on their meagre savings or entirely on their children for sustenance. In the absence of any such support, many of them suffer loss of independence and self-dignity,” he said. He, however, added that with the life expectancy increasing, many senior citizens of the age group 60-70 years are physically fit. Rekha Murthy, HelpAge India, Karnataka Head, said besides the economic criteria, many of them choose to opt for re-employment as they want to remain active and share their experience and knowledge. Challenges It’s not easy though. Many elders said they faced the challenge of not being tech savvy. Salaries too appeared to be an issue. Illavarasi Rani, 64, who has been working as a college hostel warden for over a year said she chose this job as she wanted to move away from the house due personal problems.“I am glad that I am able to manage my expenses on my own. However, we are also not paid as per industry standards; we are paid much less,” she said.

Better interaction with people solves many issues: New SP|Mangaluru|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|While stressing on having mutual respect between the police and the public, the new Superintendent of Police B.M. Laxmi Prasad on Wednesday said better interaction between the two solves many problems. Talking to reporters, Mr. Prasad said it was necessary for the police to have a patient hearing of people’s problems. “There is fear about the police. We need to remove the fear and have a good relationship.” Mr. Prasad said he will strive to strengthen the new beat system put in place by his predecessor Ravikanthe Gowda B.R. in which a police constable discharges the role of an inspector of his area. “I am keen on fortifying the (new beat) system,” he said and added that he will follow ‘people-friendly policing’ guidelines laid down by the Director-General and Inspector-General of Police. Terming the district as more sensitive than others, Mr. Prasad said he believed in maintaining a good communication channel with people. “But if the situation goes off hand, then I know how to handle it,” he said and added that this was his first independent charge of a district. The police will act as per law and will not be favouring any community, he added. While maintaining that there was no question of allowing illegal sand mining and transportation, Mr. Prasad said he will study the issue and take necessary action, including creation of new check-posts. Mr. Prasad, who earlier served as the Superintendent of Police of Anti Naxal Force, Karkala, said effective action by the State government had largely kept the activities of Maoists under control. The ANF and district police units are now tasked with continuing the vigil and maintaining the same control. Mr. Prasad, a 2014-batch IPS officer, had his schooling in Kudremukh. He finished his B.E. (computer science) from R.V. Engineering College, Bengaluru. Having worked for five years in an IT firm, Mr. Prasad cleared the UPSC in the second attempt to enter IPS. “It’s the drive to serve people and have a better understanding of the society that made me choose IPS,” Mr. Prasad said and added nearly 70% of IPS officers in 2014 were engineering graduates. Mr. Prasad first served as Assistant Superintendent of Police, Bagalkot. He then served as SP, ANF before this posting as SP, Internal Security (Centre for Counter Terrorism), Bengaluru.|0|

‘Bhagavan has chosen the path of Ninda Stuti for speedy salvation’|MANGALURU|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Dharmasthala Dharmadhikari D. Veerendra Heggade on Wednesday said that rationalist K.S. Bhagavan appears to be following the Ninda Stuti (hate worship) of Lord Rama to attain speedy salvation. Interacting with reporters at Dharmasthala on Wednesday, Mr. Heggade said that Lord Vishnu had cursed Jaya-Vijaya, his gatekeepers, either to opt for seven re-births as his devotees or three rebirths as his enemies before they could resume duties, for a mistake. It looks like Mr. Bhagavan has chosen the Trijanma Moksha (three rebirths to attain salvation), Mr. Heggade said, referring to the rationalist’s outbursts against Lord Rama.  Sabarimala On the Sabarimala issue, Mr. Heggade said that tradition pertaining to any religious place should be preserved as they are there for a reason.

‘Set up cybercrime cell in State Women’s Commission’|MYSURU|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Karantaka State Women’s Commission has urged the Director-General of Police Neelamani Raju to set up a cybercrime cell in the commission as most complaints involved the misuse of various social media platforms to victimise women. Commission chairperson Nagalakshmi Bai told reporters that more than 60 per cent of the complaints received by the commission involve the misuse of social media. The commission has to depend on the police department’s cybercrime wing to investigate the crime and the process takes a long time. Hence, Ms. Bai said a cyber crime cell in the commission will help them pursue the complaints expeditiously. Out of the 5,080 complaints the commission received during the last two years, 4,500 had been resolved. The remaining are in different stages of investigation. Ms. Bai, who also visited Shahi Exports in Mysuru after receiving complaints, expressed surprise over the absence of any complaints submitted to the internal complaints committee (ICC) of the factory even though a large number of employees were facing a variety of problems. She lashed out at the Labour Department for their alleged inaction in the matter of harassment to women employees in various companies, particularly textile factories. Ms. Bai said she is working towards overhauling the ICC, which comprises not only employees, but also representatives of the management. “When the management representatives are present in the committee, the employees will hesitate to complain, lest they lose their jobs. Hence, the commission is working towards removing the management representatives from the ICC. Let there be representatives from NGOs, doctors or advocates,” she said.|0|

Tortured 87-year-old widow rescued|MYSURU|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Karnataka State Commission for Women came to the rescue of an 87-year-old widow, who was allegedly confined to the house and tortured by her son and grandson at Bogadi in Mysuru. After receiving a complaint from the neighbours that Mangala Gowramma, was being beaten and subjected to various kinds of torture in confinement, the commission chairperson Nagalakshmi Bai, accompanied by police personnel, visited the house on Wednesday. The commission not only extracted an assurance from her son, Krupashankar, 71, that he will look after his mother and meet all her needs, but also lodged a police complaint against him and grandson, Sandeep, 35, who had allegedly beaten her. Property issue Ms. Bai said inquiries revealed that the victim was the owner of property estimated to be worth around Rs. 7.5 crore, including two houses in Bengaluru and two plots of farmland. However, under pressure from Krupashankar, she had transferred all her property to him. They were staying in a rented house at Prashanthnagar in Bogadi. Though she was being tortured by her son and grandson during the last few years, their treatment worsened after she recently handed over some of her silver articles to her daughter, who stays in Chennai. “She was even pushed out of the house one night, but following the intervention of the neighbours, she managed to get back inside. She had to borrow money from the maid for her sustenance,” Ms. Bai said. “A diabetic, she was denied even her daily dose of medicine. She was kept incommunicado. The grandson had snatched her mobile phone from her and smashed it a few days ago,” she said. Though Krupashankar, who had married three women, but had been separated from all of them, has promised to look after the mother, Ms. Bai said the commission had lodged a complaint against him as well, and sought the arrest of the grandson, who had allegedly beaten the old woman. The commission has also directed the police to regularly check on the well-being of the woman and report to the commission. Citing a recent order by the Supreme Court, which has made it mandatory for the children to take care of their elderly parents, Ms. Bai said the commission would stand by the widow in her legal battle to take back at least a portion of the property she had already bequeathed to his son.|0|

‘I don’t endorse women’s entry’|MYSURU|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Karnataka State Women’s Commission chairperson Nagalakshmi Bai has said that she does not endorse the entry of women into the Ayyappa temple at Sabarimala. When asked to react to the uproar over two women entering the temple premises early on Wednesday morning, Ms. Bai said she was “personally against violating religious traditions in the country”. She cited the example of how among Muslims, women are not allowed into mosques, and argued that there is a tradition against entry of women aged above 10 and below 50 into the Ayyappa temple, which should be respected. “Ours is a country of traditions. Religious traditions are particularly sensitive. No attempt should be made to provoke sentiments of the people by forcibly breaking tradition,” she said, adding that the entry of women into the temple would send out a “wrong message”. When she was reminded that the Supreme Court had permitted the entry of women, she said everybody should bow their heads to the apex court’s directions and her views on the matter were personal. Meanwhile, writer S.L. Bhyrappa said that prevention of entry of women into the temple was part of traditional belief and there were a few temples where the entry of men is banned. He alleged that the communist ideology was being forced upon the people in Kerala.|0|

Veerabhadra Simpi, president of the district unit of Kannada Sahitya Parishat, addressing presspersons here on Wednesday, said that efforts are on to conduct the prestigious event in Kalaburagi.

Political parties criticised for not restoring original powers of Lokayukta|KALABURAGI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The former Lokayukta N. Santosh Hegde has criticised all mainstream political parties for going back on their promise of restoring the Lokayukta’s original powers to conduct independent investigation in corruption cases and taking action against government officers. Inaugurating an interaction session on “Lokayukta and present scenario” organised by the Sriguru Chikkaveereshwar Samsthan Mutt of Srinivas Saradagi in Kalaburagi on Tuesday, Mr. Hedge said that all the mainstream political parties, including the BJP, the Congress and the Janata Dal(S), had, in their manifestos before the elections, promised to strengthen the institution of the Lokayukta. The Congress-Janata Dal(S) coalition government in the State has neglected the issue after it came to power, he added. Mr. Hegde said that politicians and government officers have always opposed the Lokayukta being provided with extra teeth because rampant corruption lies within the two pillars of democracy — the Legislature and the Executive. There could be no major corruption without connivance between bureaucrats and public representatives. Mr. Hegde added. Mr. Hegde recalled the situation prior to 1984 when the State had a Vigilance Commission headed by a retired High Court judge and an Anti Corruption Bureau headed by senior police officers. The then government headed by Ramakrishna Hegde found that this set-up was inefficient and merged both the Vigilance Commission and Anti Corruption Bureau and formed the Lokayukta. But the provisions of the draft Karnataka Lokayukta Bill 2015, introduced by the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government, had taken away almost all powers of the institution of Lokayukta, including the right to conduct raids on those accused under the Prevention of Corruption Act. After the removal of several sections from the Lokayukta Act, the institution lost its power to issue summons or conduct investigation under any section of the Indian Penal Code. The Lokayukta officials can only conduct inquiries as per the relevant Act. Mr. Hegde said that more than 700 raids were conducted during his five-year tenure as Lokayukta between 2006 and 2011, including those on three former Chief Ministers, IAS and IPS officers and other top bureaucrats. To a question from a member of the audience, Mr. Hegde said that everyone has to fight corruption and society should be more vigilant. He urged youths to make efforts to bring change in society and lead a corruption-free life. He said that there was a need for honesty among public representatives and in government departments while addressing the problems faced by the common people. The former Minister S.K. Kanta, farmer leader Maruti Manpade and Nagalingayya Mathapati and others were present.|0|
After a four-year gap, KSOU to hold convocation|MYSURU|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The convocation of the Karnataka State Open University (KSOU) for conferring degrees on the anxiously-waiting students is expected to happen either in January-end or early February, after a gap of four years. The date will be announced upon confirmation from the office of the Governor, who is the Chancellor of the university. The convocation is meant only for students who have cleared in-house courses for which admissions had been taken in 2012-13. The last convocation was held in March 2015 and the university was de-recognised three months after the 12th convocation. About 28,000 students had received degrees in the convocation held at Kalamandira here. The students who had taken admissions in the academic year 2012-13 were awaiting conferment of their degrees as the university officials were engaged in getting back the recognition that was terminated by the UGC in June 2015. KSOU Vice-Chancellor B. Shivalingaiah toldThe Hinduthat the university was making arrangements for holding the convocation. It could have been conducted earlier, may be soon after the UGC restored the recognition last year. “I came to know many students have applied for revaluation. Unless the results of such students were not announced, it would be inappropriate to conduct the convocation. I have therefore told the staff to prepare the list of students eligible for degrees taking into consideration the results after revaluation,” the VC said. Prof. Shivalingaiah said the students of 2012-13 batch may have to wait for another three years to receive their degrees if the convocation was not conducted now. “Therefore, all steps had been taken in this regard and ensure that no student, who has cleared the course, was left out,” he said, adding that some students have cleared their courses in 2017 as the university conducted examination for such students.|0|
‘Encourage alcoholics to give up their addiction’|UDUPI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Na. Mogasale, writer, said on Tuesday that it was essential to provide proper medical treatment to alcoholics so that they gave up alcoholism and joined the mainstream of society. He was speaking after inaugurating the 26th annual 10-day Alcohol De-addiction Camp organised by the Udupi-Karavali unit of the Indian Medical Association, Kamal A. Baliga Charities, Mumbai, and other organisations, at the Dr. A.V. Baliga Memorial Hospital, here. Dr. Mogasale said that it was necessary to see alcoholics as human beings. People were these days living a high-pressure life, which had made them forget themselves, he added. Efforts such as the de-addiction camp would go a long way in helping alcoholics give up their addiction, he said. Releasing a book, “Baluvantha Huve… Baaduvase Yeke” written by P.V. Bhandary, psychiatrist, and Nagarajamurthy, psychologist, Director of All Karnataka Janajagriti Vedike, Vivek V. Pais, said that compassion and humanity were two instruments in the hands of human beings to lead a peaceful life. Often a fickle mind led people to get addicted to alcoholism. There were many who coaxed people to drink. In comparison, there were few who encouraged alcoholics to give up their addiction. The habit of alcoholism was bad, he said. Those who were previously alcoholics but had given up alcoholism for over five years were felicitated on the occasion. They included Ramesh Manipal, Ashok Malpe, John D’Souza and Sunil.

Don’t play with sentiments of people by citing past conventions: Congress|Special Correspondent Bengaluru|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Condemning the Bharatiya Janata Party’s opposition to entry of women of all ages to Kerala’s Sabarimala temple, Congress leaders here said political parties should refrain from playing with the sentiments of the people, particularly women, citing past conventions. Manuvadi mindset Speaking toThe Hinduon Wednesday, V.S. Ugrappa, Ballari MP, said it reflects the discriminatory “Manuvadi mindset” of BJP leaders. Describing the Supreme Court’s verdict “progressive”, Mr. Ugrappa said there should not be any gender discrimination for worship. “Only people having Manuvadi mindset are opposing women’s entry into the temple,” he said. KPCC spokespersons H.A. Venkatesh and V.R. Sudarshan, former chairman of the Legislative Council, too opposed the BJP and Sangh Parivar’s stand, saying more women should come forward to speak on the issue and educate people on the judgment. Mr. Sudarshan said the BJP has been opposing the darshan of Lord Ayyappa without historical evidence. “One cannot prevent women’s entry into the temple citing past conventions,” he claimed. Mr. Venkatesh questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s silence on the matter and said the BJP adopts “double standards” with regard to triple talaq and the Sabarimala issue. Mr. Modi on Tuesday had said that while triple talaq is a matter of gender equality, entry of women into Sabarimala is related to tradition. The Congress leaders opposed the “emotional blackmail of women” and said it was the duty of the Kerala government to enforce the apex court’s verdict, without fear or favour.|0|

State govt. seeks Rs. 16,000 cr. crop loss from Centre|Vijayapura|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Minister for Agriculture N.H. Shivashankara Reddy has said that the government has sought Rs. 16,000 crore from the Union government for crop loss due to drought in the State. Addressing presspersons here on Wednesday, he said that the amount submitted is only for kharif loss and the survey for the rabi loss is under way. “The survey is expected to be completed within a week. Only then will we get a clear picture on the quantum of loss,” he said. On the allegations that the government is yet to start procuring toor, Mr. Reddy said that the procurement will start within two to three days. Taking exception to the statement of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who recently claimed that only 800 farmers of Karnataka have benefited from loan waiver, Mr. Reddy claimed that around 60,000 farmers have already got the benefits. The Minister claimed that after Karnataka waived farm loans, other States in north India began replicating it. On the allegations that custom hire centres are not performing well in many districts of the State, Mr. Reddy said the government has decided to offer the functioning of centres to the Rural Development Organisation. “We have so far requested the NGO to take up the operation of entire State, however we still yet to receive reply from the NGO,” he said. Later, chairing a review meeting he said that the government is contemplating putting a condition to crop insurance agencies to appoint a coordinator in every district to coordinate between the agency and the Agriculture Department. He also said that the decision has been taken following complaints by officials that agencies are not cooperating with the officials in settling the claims owing to which complaints are piling up. Health Minister Shivanand Patil, who was also in the meeting, advised agriculture officials to promote multi-crop system instead of cultivating single crop in the district.|0|

LDF condemns Sangh attack on women’s wall|KANNUR|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Left Democratic Front (LDF) in the Kasaragod district has alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party has lost its sanity following the massive turnout for the women’s wall. Condemning the incidents in different parts of the district here on Tuesday, when BJP workers allegedly carried out attacks against women who arrived to join the wall, Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader and LDF district convener K.P. Satheesh Chandran said at a press conference in Kasaragod here on Wednesday said that the wall was organised in an unimaginable manner surpassing the campaign of untruth launched by the Sangh Parivar. The Sangh Parivar had unleashed the attack against the women who came to join the wall, Mr. Chandran said. The CPI(M) leader said that 27 people, including 15 women, four each media persons, police personnel, and LDF workers had suffered injuries in the attack. The injuries suffered by two women were serious and they had been admitted in a Mangaluru hospital, he said, adding that the other injured were undergoing treatment in Kasaragod. He said the incidents of attack had occurred mainly at Chettukundu, Kuthirappadi, Thattummal, and Kattumadam.

No fisheries operation in coastal districts on Jan. 6|UDUPI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|A meeting of fishermen at the Malpe fisheries harbour here on Wednesday decided to shut down fisheries operations in all three coastal districts and stage a ‘rasta roko’ on National Highway 66 at Karavali Junction here on January 6. They decided to do this to put pressure on the State government to trace the fishing boat, Suvarna Tribhuja with seven fishermen on board, which went missing off the Goa coast on December 15. Speaking to presspersons after the meeting, Satish Kundar, president of Malpe Fishermen’s Association, said that it was 18 days since the boat went missing. But neither the Udupi district in-charge Minister Jaimala nor the Fisheries Minister Venkatarao Nadagouda had bothered to visit the fishermen in Malpe with regard to the missing boat. About 1,000 deep-sea trawlers and 130 purse seine boats had stopped their fishing operations and were anchored at the Malpe fisheries harbour for the last nine days after the Suvarna Tribhuja went missing as this created an atmosphere of fright among the fishermen. Only small country boats were going out for fishing, he said. Yashpal Suvarna, president of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi Districts Cooperative Fish Marketing Federation, said that on January 6 the fishermen will gather in large numbers at the Malpe harbour at 8.30 a.m. They will then leave on a padayatra to Karavali Junction and stage a rasta roko on National Highway 66. This agitation will continue till Ms. Jaimala came and pacified the fishermen. The fishermen in all fisheries harbours in the State will shut down their business, he said. Earlier, speaking at the meeting, Anand Kharvi Uppunda, fishermen leader, said that Mr. Nadagouda had camped in Byndoor for nearly 15 days to campaign for the Janata Dal (Secular) – Congress candidate, Madhu Bangarappa in the recently concluded bypolls for Shivamogga parliamentary seat. “But Mr. Nadagouda has all the time for election campaign, but has no time for fishermen though the boat has been untraceable for last 18 days,” he said. Manju Billava, another fishermen leader, demanded to know why Ms. Jaimala, despite being district incharge Minister, had not come and meet the fishermen despite such a serious incident. “Do we need such an irresponsible district in-charge Minister?” he questioned.|0|
Protesters throw stones at KSRTC bus|KANNUR|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|A Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) bus was attacked by two masked men at the BOT bus terminal here on Wednesday, amid protests by the Sabarimala Karma Samithi (SKS) and the Bharatiya Janata Party against the entry of two young women to the Sabarimala temple.

Police should not be abettors of crime: HC|KOCHI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court has observed that the police are deemed to be guardians to protect the life and property of citizens and when the guardians turn perpetrators, society will perish and anarchy will prevail. The Bench was dismissing on Wednesday an appeal filed by T. Ajith Kumar, DySP, Crime Branch, seeking to suspend his conviction by the CBI Special Court, Thiruvananthapuram, in the Udayakumar custodial death case. He was sub-inspector of the Fort police station at the time of the incident. The petitioner was sentenced to three-year jail term after he was found guilty of offence under Sections 167 (public servant framing an incorrect document with intent to cause injury) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender) of the Indian Penal Code. The court observed that custodial torture was against all the fundamental rights of a citizen and such instances had to be viewed very seriously. While considering the applications of the accused, the court should also keep in mind the plight of the legal heirs of the victim and the impression society would have, in the event of suspending the conviction. Silent spectator The court said that as a sub-inspector of a police station, it was his duty to ensure that the records were properly kept. May be he would not have involved in the manipulation of documents but at least he should have the knowledge about it and brought it to the notice of the competent authorities. Being a silent spectator for such acts itself have very serious consequences and repercussion to the rule of law and rights of citizens.|0|
Traders to defy hartal call|Kochi|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Joint Action Council Against Hartal (JACAH), a forum formed in the aftermath of a ‘flash’ hartal called by the Bharatiya Janata Party on the Sabarimala issue in December, will adopt a two-pronged strategy of insurance coverage and legal recourse in what seems to be a protracted battle against hartals. The council was formed with 45 organisations representing chambers of commerce and industry, merchants, service providers, tourism industry, tour and transport operators, Indian Medical Association, Kerala Management Association, and educational institutions. The number has swelled thereon. “Since destruction of vehicles and property is the main deterrent to resisting hartals, we were planning to implement an insurance scheme. But this hartal came way too soon. Besides, we are also planning to approach the court citing the illegality of forceful closure of shops and disruption of traffic and for fixing the responsibility of damage caused by the hartal with the organisation calling for it,” said architect S. Gopakumar, a founding member of the JACAH. The latest hartal called by the Sabarimala Karma Samithi on Thursday comes less than a fortnight after the JACAH requested the government for a moratorium on hartals. Tourism sector’s plea Meanwhile, tourism industry stakeholders have urged the government and the public to cooperate for the smooth functioning of the tourism sector on Thursday. After the floods, the tourism industry was slowly bouncing back to normality. “December-January is the peak season and a hartal at this time will cause huge hardships for the tourists who have already made their travel plans,” they added. Cameras near shops The Anti Hartal Coordination Committee, a combine of 49 organisations under the Kerala Trade and Industries Coordination Forum, said shops would function as usual. V.A. Yousuf, president, said the government and the police should provide protection for safe functioning. Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samiti (KVVES) president T. Nazirudeen said traders had kitted out their establishments with surveillance cameras to record any attempt to disrupt business. Hartal organisers who hurt commerce would be sued. Private buses are likely to stay off the road in the climate of fear and unrest. “Though we have aligned against hartals, we will have to take into consideration the prevailing atmosphere,” said M.B. Sathyan, president, Kerala Private Bus Operators Federation.|0|
Idukki DTPC to celebrate district’s settler heritage|IDUKKI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|With Idukki completing a century of human migration, the District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC) is set to commemorate it with a befitting memorial near the district headquarters. The entrance to the memorial park will have a sculpture of ‘Kudiyetta Karshakan’ (settler farmer) similar to the ‘Kuravan Kurathi’ sculpture at Ramakkalmedu, a landmark at the tourism spot. DTPC secretary Jayan P. Vijayan toldThe Hinduthat the project aimed at exploring the tourism potential of Cheruthoni and the memorial park would come up on its 100 acres adjacent to the Idukki dam. “There will be different monuments to explain settlements in the district in addition to the various phases of development in the earlier period,” he said adding that there would be sculptures of those who contributed to the history of the district. Mr. Vijayan said with more tourists visiting Munnar and Wagamon, the DTPC was exploring the possibility of tapping the tourism potential of Cheruthoni. There were many less-known tourism spots in and around Cheruthoni and the Tourism Department planned to make it a major tourism centre. “The Hill View Park under the DTPC provides one of the best views of the Idukki dam and adjoining areas. With the completion of the memorial park, visitors will have more space to move around,” Mr. Vijayan said. The work on the two accommodation facilities under the Tourism Department - Ecolog and Yatri Nivas - was in the final stage of construction. At the memorial park, there would be photographs depicting early life in the district, cafeteria, resting places, laser theatre, and an exhibition of farm instruments in the early years. There would be facilities to promote adventure tourism. The statues of settler leaders who led the early agitations would also come up at the park. Mr. Vijayan said the work on the memorial park was expected to start in January as the government had allotted Rs. 3 crore for the first phase of the Rs. 10-crore project.|0|

In-principle nod from State govt. for suburban rail DPR|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The meeting also decided to jointly agree on the Detailed Project Report (DPR) to be tabled before Railway Board before January 15 for final approval. The SWR and the State government have agreed to lease 650 acres of railway land and 150 acres of government land respectively at a nominal Rs. 1/acre for the project. As total of 150 acres of private land needs to be acquired for which the expenditure was capped at Rs. 2,130 crore as per RITES report during the meeting. The State government has also agreed to provide for a high Floor Space Index (FSI) of 5 along the sub-urban rail corridors, which is expected to be leveraged to finance the project. In the meeting, it was decided to jointly resolve any issue of intersections with roads and Namma Metro lines in the city. In another major development, the earlier sanctioned suburban rail projects worth Rs. 1,745 crore, which was decided to be taken up under cost-sharing basis between the SWR and the State government, will now be done by Railways alone. These projects include: doubling of track between Baiyappanahalli–Hosur with electrification and automatic signalling from Baiyappanahalli to Salem, doubling of Yeshwantpur–Chennasandra line and provision of automatic signalling in Bengaluru–Tumakuru, Bengaluru–Mandya and Yeshwantpur–Yelahanka segments, apart from adding additional MEMU rakes, sources said.|0|
Pokkali rice is going places|Kochi|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Not many Malayalis may have heard about pokkali, but Kerala’s very own indigenous rice variety is inspiring scientists the world over to develop new rice cultivars in an effort to build resilience against climate change. Several teams of researchers have turned to pokkali to study how the indigenous rice variety, which is traditionally cultivated only in the districts of Ernakulam, Thrissur and Alappuzha, is able to thrive in naturally-occurring saline coastal paddy fields. A team, including scientists from New Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), has found through a series of experiments conducted over six years that the high expression of a specific gene – OsIF – stabilizes the plant’s photosynthetic machinery in high salinity conditions, thereby playing a crucial role in pokkali’s tolerance to salty conditions. ‘Transgenic’ rice The team developed a new rice variety by moving this single gene from pokkali to IR64 (a high-yielding variety cultivated in more than 200 countries). They found that this resulting ‘transgenic’ or modified rice was even more tolerant to salty conditions and high temperatures than pokkali itself. “Pokkali has an excellent gene pool which is very useful for salinity tolerance,” said Professor Ashwani Pareek of JNU, co-author of the study published inScientific Reports, who has been studying the genetic basis of pokkali’s impressive salinity tolerance for the past two decades. In his laboratory, at least a dozen unique genes from pokkali have been identified and characterised for stress tolerance. Kochi’s Rice Research Station (RRS) also created a similar variety in 2015 by moving another portion of pokkali’s DNA (named Saltol QTL, which has also been shown to aid the plant’s salt tolerance) into Jyothi, one of the State’s popular rice breeds. Named Jyotsna and released officially less than a year ago after successful field trials in 2017, the new variety is now being distributed to farmers, said Shylaraj K.S., Director of the RRS. Useful traits On an average, pokkali fields yield only around one-and-a-half tonnes per hectare, she said. “While pokkali’s best yields are up to four tonnes per hectare, Jyotsna easily produces up to six tonnes in good soil conditions,” she said. Several foreign research institutes, including the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines, have also been studying pokkali’s gene pools and has identified a portion of DNA on one of its chromosomes that is crucial for salt tolerance, said Dr. Pareek. With pokkali also being tolerant to submergence in water for a week, it does have numerous useful traits, said Dr. Shylaraj. As a result, farmers reported that pokkali fields in Kadamakkudy and Varapuzha were relatively unaffected by the floods that ravaged paddy fields where other short rice varieties were cultivated, she said. Need for conservation In a recent review of Kerala’s indigenous rice varieties published in the journalCurrent Science, scientists at Chennai’s M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation argue that given the wide range of such adaptations of these indigenous rice varieties as well as their ability to thrive under harsh climatic conditions, conserving them is critical in promoting climate-resilient agriculture. “Unpredictable monsoons and higher temperatures are fallouts of climate change and we need high-yielding varieties that can trump over these,” said Dr. Pareek.

Around 100 arrested in Kochi|KOCHI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Close to 100 people, including Sangh Parivar and Kerala Students Union activists, were arrested across the district in connection with protests organised against the entry of two women below the age of 50 years into the Sabarimala Temple on Wednesday. A majority of the arrested were released on bail except those charged with serious offences. The Vadakkekkara police arrested two Sangh Parivar activists on the charge of assaulting a women officer of the Special Branch on duty at Thuruthipuram. The arrested are Santhosh and Unnithan from Kodungalloor. The protesters had allegedly smashed the windshield of a KSRTC bus, and the officer was recording a video and collecting evidence from the bus crew when a group of five assaulted her. “They [protesters] grabbed her hand and took away her mobile phone. We are on the hunt for the remaining three accused. The arrested have been slapped with provisions of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act and various Sections of the IPC, including 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty),” said Stepto John, Sub Inspector, Vadakkekkara police. Marches taken out The Central Police arrested around 50 KSU and Sangh Parivar activists in connection with two separate demonstrations. While the KSU activists were arrested on the charge of taking out a protest march to the office of the District Police Chief (Kochi City), the Sangh Parivar activists were arrested on the charge of conducting a march to the venue of a programme organised by Dalit and women’s rights activists celebrating the entry of women into the Sabarimala Temple. Three women who allegedly tried to disrupt the programme and manhandle the activists were also arrested. The Kothamangalam police arrested and released on bail 20 persons who had participated in a police station march. Twelve persons were arrested by the Kunnathunadu police on the charge of disrupting traffic at Pattimattom Junction, while cases were registered against another 40 persons. The police remain on high alert in the district in the wake of the developments in Sabarimala. “The entire force in the rural district has been mobilised, and all officers on leave have been called back. A special police bandobast plan has been drawn up. Maximum men have been deployed on the field with strict direction to firmly deal with violence by invoking non-bailable charges against the perpetrators,” said Rahul R. Nair, District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural). Meanwhile, the two women pilgrims who were on their way back after entering the hilltop shrine crossed the district limits to Thrissur around 12.30 p.m. Considering security threats, they reportedly changed vehicles en route.|0|
Brahmapuram fire: Oppn. seeks emergency meet|KOCHI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Opposition LDF has demanded an emergency council meeting to discuss the issue of the Brahmapuram solid waste treatment plant where plastic waste caught fire on Tuesday evening. Opposition leader K.J. Antony and LDF Parliamentary Party leader V.P. Chandran has written to the Mayor in this regard. The fire at Brahmapuram was quite serious, and a bigger damage was averted by sheer luck, the Opposition observed. It said that plastic waste remains carelessly dumped on the plant premises. The Opposition had repeatedly warned against the possibility of fire in such circumstances. The opposition councillors who had visited the plant had called for emergency corrective measures, but in vain. In a release issued here, Mr. Chandran said no scientific treatment facilities in compliance with the Central Plastic Waste Management Rules had been set up at the plant where more than 150 tonnes of plastic waste are dumped daily. Nothing is being done to segregate or recycle plastic waste. Two fire tenders continue to be deployed on standby at the plant as a precaution against any revival of fire. “The wind had fanned the embers on Tuesday night reviving it in patches. However, the fire tenders stationed at the plant doused it by around 2 a.m. on Wednesday, said a fire force official. Fire fighting unit Mayor Soumini Jain said a fire fighting unit would be installed at the plant as soon as Plan funds were available. She added that the plant had not been affected in any way, and that waste collection would be restored the day after hartal.|0|
Now, student doctors for health awareness|KANNUR|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|A grama panchayat in the eastern hill areas of the district has roped in school students for health awareness under an innovative, ‘student doctor’ programme, that envisages deployment of trained students to be active in health awareness initiatives in the panchayat. Under the first phase of the student doctor programme, 101 students have been trained to equip them to take part in the health awareness activities in the panchayat. At a function at Kunnoth Higher Secondary School in the panchayat here on Wednesday, Health Minister K.K. Shylaja inaugurated the programme and distributed badges to the trained students at the function. The panchayat has conducted training programmes for the students on various health-related topics.

Vembanad fish count records 115 species|Kochi|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The post-flood Vembanad fish count of 2018, conducted on December 21, 22, and 23 by the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology (ATRE) and the Community Environmental Resource Centre (CERC) to determine whether the floods had caused changes in fish diversity and resources of Vembanad Lake, has recorded the presence of 115 fish species here. North, south surveys Surveys began in the northern regions of the lake (the High Court, Aroorkutty, Poothotta and Manjali areas) on December 22 and concluded the next day at the Thanneermukkam bund. From these northern areas alone, the team, including those from the State Wetland Authority, ANTRIX Corporation, and the Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies (KUFOS), recorded 82 fin fishes and nine species of freshwater fish. On December 23, the southern regions of the lake, including Thanneermukkam, Punnamada, and Kayippuram, were surveyed. The team obtained a total of 46 fin fishes and five freshwater fish from the region. The last fish count (conducted in May 2018) had recorded a total of 110 species in the lake. According to ATRE-CERC project coordinator Jojo T.D., the presence of marine fish and exotic fish (such as African catfish and tilapia) caused the increase in fish species. It could also be due to seasonal changes in fish species diversity as well as the heavy current that could have swept away some local fish populations. Market survey The survey also consisted of interviews with local fishermen who depend on the fish resources of the Vembanad Lake for livelihood as well as market surveys to determine the composition of fish catch available for sale. The surveys and interviews showed that the availability of fish had come down post-flood. There has also been a decrease in fish species that bring in high income for local fishermen such as pearl spot (karimeen) and shrimp. Several fishermen attributed the phenomenon to the increase in exotic species in the lake. Other observations made during the survey included the presence of water hyacinth in the southern areas of the lake which has grown indiscriminately. Similarly, silt deposits brought into the lake bed during the floods affected fish populations. However, detailed studies would be required to study the impact of the floods, Mr. Jojo said.|0|

Praise for the duo, fury at ‘cleansing’|KOCHI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|“It isn’t the beginning of a year, but of an era,” wrote writer Sethu on social media, as reports of two women of menstruating age, Bindu Ammini and Kanakadurga, seeking darshan at the Sabarimala temple trickled in. While the Supreme Court had upheld the right of women of all age groups to worship at the temple in September last year, resistance from Sangh Parivar had prevented that till the other day. Several writers equated the entry to great human accomplishments. N.S. Madhavan likened it to the maiden Mount Everest summit in 1953. Poet P.N. Gopikrishnan marked the moment as similar to the first conquest of Mt. Everest by a woman, Junko Tabei, in 1975. But, as word spread about the temple being shut for ‘purification’ rites, there was anger in equal measure. “#Sabarimalaclosed for purification? Is this Kerala or some place in cow land? Women are new Dalits? Bindu and Kanakadurga only followed the SC ruling.#RemoveSabarimalaThantrifor misogyny and serious contempt of court,” Mr. Madhavan tweeted. Dalit reaction Similar sentiments were echoed by Dalit activists, including academic Rekha Raj, who urged the government to invoke action under Article 17 of the Constitution and under the SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act against the Tantri for “practising untouchability against the two women.” Dalit and tribal rights activists gathered at Vanchi Square near the High Court to distribute sweets to celebrate the temple entry, hailing it as a watershed in gender equality struggles. While three women tried to disrupt the meeting with Ayyappa chants, they were removed by the police.  N.S. Madhavan likened it to the maiden Mount Everest summit in 1953.|0|

Excise draws up plan to crack down on drugs|KOCHI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|With narcotics proving to be a far bigger menace than liquor, the Excise Department has drawn up an action plan aimed at choking the drug supply line in the district. Speaking toThe Hinduhere on Monday, Chandra Palan K., Deputy Excise Commissioner, Ernakulam, said the focus would be on cracking down on the movement of synthetic drugs. “Youngsters will continue to look for a high one way or the other. But with liquor being easily available now, we hope the demand for drugs comes down this year,” said Mr. Chandra Palan. However, the department is in no mood to let the guard down. “Since these drugs [synthetic] are very costly, they are hardly consumed here but merely passes through the city unlike stuff like Nitrozepam tablets which are easily available and come cheap,” the officer said. The department has drawn up an intelligence network at its divisional and circle offices. A shadow team under the Deputy Excise Commissioner is engaged in intelligence gathering, while there are intelligence teams under all seven circle offices, in addition to the Anti-Narcotic Special Squad. Then there is a special squad under Excise Commissioner Rishi Raj Singh that works across the State. “Youngsters engaged in intelligence are doing a daring job at considerable risk by infiltrating drug rackets. However, to their credit, they find the task interesting and exciting,” Mr. Chandra Palan said. Abkari cases Meanwhile, Abkari cases have come down considerably over the last few years, especially within the city limits with a few ones registered being mostly related to public consumption of alcohol. “Bootlegging and illicit liquor trade have come down drastically, whereas brewing illicit arrack has become not worth the risk considering the stringent non-bailable charges it attracts,” the officer said.|0|

BJP offers support to hartal despite initial dithering|KOZHIKODE|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The BJP has formally offered support to Thursday’s State-wide hartal announced by the Sabarimala Karma Samiti. The party had initially feigned ignorance about the hartal call given by the samiti in protest against the entry of two women to the Sabarimala temple, and the involvement of its cadre in the violent protests in different parts of the State on Wednesday. Addressing the media here on early Wednesday afternoon, BJP State unit president P.S. Sreedharan Pillai had claimed that he was not aware of the blocking of vehicles and forced closure of shops in different parts of Kerala by alleged activists of Sangh Parivar outfits. He said that the BJP would only launch a “non-violent and peaceful agitation involving devotees” against the alleged attempt by the Left Democratic Front government to destroy the hill shrine. Inquiry sought Seeking an inquiry into how those women managed to offer worship at the temple, Mr. Pillai accused the State government and the CPI(M) of hatching a conspiracy and hurting the sentiments of the devotees. Quoting a news report from a Malayalam news channel, he also claimed that a senior police official in Kottayam district had joined hands with CPI(M) local leaders and a member of the Travancore Devaswom Board to ensure that the women had a ‘darshan’ at Sabarimala. “This is a betrayal. These atheists have an agenda to damage the temple,” he claimed. The BJP leader also said that the party would rally behind the 40-odd pro-Hindu organisations and the ‘sanyasis’ who had launched the agitation seeking conservation of the Sabarimala customs, and stage protests on Thursday. However, by later in the afternoon, Mr. Pillai told the media that the BJP would offer its support to the hartal call, claiming that the devotees would offer a “stiff resistance to the bid to ruin the temple”.|0|
Police sound alert as violence erupts across State|Thiruvananthapuram|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Hindu right wing outfits, enraged over the closure of the Sabarimala temple for purification rituals following the entry of two women of childbearing age to the sanctum, unleashed violence across the State on Wednesday.

Noting that Mannam sought to serve his community denouncing the well-paid job of a lawyer, Mr. Parasaran said the social reformer had realised the significance of education in the growth of any community. “He approached the wealthy class to collect money to commence educational institutions and persuaded people to donate land for the purpose,” he said. Despite his role as a social reformer, Mannam had meticulously chosen to stay away from the mainstream politics except on two occasions. “One occasion was very important when he opposed the then Diwan of Travancore Sir C.P. Ramaswami Iyer’s stance on the merger of Travancore and Cochin to Indian Union,” he said. Delivering his presidential address, NSS president P.N. Narendranathan Nair said the NSS would continue its fight to protect the faith, custom, and traditions of the Hindu community. “The news about two young women entering the Sannidhanam should not distract our resolve to continue the legal battle in the Sabarimala issue,” he said. Former High Court judge A.V. Ramakrishna Pillai delivered the keynote address. Writer C. Radhakrishnan made the remembrance speech. NSS general secretary G. Sukumaran Nair welcomed the gathering. The event was also attended by leaders from the United Democratic Front and the Bharatiya Janata Party including Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan, P.J. Kurian, Joseph M. Puthussery, and P.K. Krishnadas, among others.|0|
Withdraw surveillance provisions: KNM|KOZHIKODE|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|A council meeting of the Kerala Nadvathul Mujahideen (Markazudawa) held here has urged the Centre to withdraw the provisions of the Information Technology Act that intrudes into the privacy of individuals. Some of the provisions allow the Central agencies to intercept, monitor and decrypt all data in electronic devices.

Tourists’ safety at risk at Kariyathanpara|Kozhikode|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Even after two recent incidents of drowning, the District Tourism Promotion Council or the local bodies concerned are yet to put in place basic safety arrangements at Kariyathanpara, one of the emerging ecotourism destinations, near Kakkayam in Kozhikode district. Now, rescue operations in times of emergency are carried out by a few local people who say that tourists ignore their warnings. Though the Kariyathanpara river is comparatively safe for tourists, swimming in deeper areas is dangerous. During festive seasons, the flow of tourists to the location increases. “We had asked the Tourism Department, the local police and the panchayat authorities to have a proper surveillance in the area as people who are totally unfamiliar with the region spend lot of time in unsafe areas here. They never listen to the advice of local residents as they think it is a kind of policing,” says Byju Joseph, a resident in the area. There were even attempts to conduct night camps and liquor parties by youths from distance locations, he claims. The police say Kariyathanpara is one of the safest destinations near Kakkayam. Only those who carelessly swim in dangerous areas or consume alcohol are at risk, they claim. When contacted, local body representatives said they had taken up the issue with the Tourism Department several times. At least, a few security guards should be posted at the spot by the DTPC as in other such prominent tourism locations, they point out. Meanwhile, Tourism Department sources said the flow of tourists to Kariyathanpara witnessed an increase very recently and that too through social media users. Efforts are on to address safety concerns in the area, they say. Small-scale homestay entrepreneurs and teashop owners in the area say the increasing number of drowning incidents will hit the popularity of the region and the development of a scenic ecotourism spot. “What we seek is a proper crowd-controlling mechanism in the area and attempts to prevent unlawful camping as it should be made one of the popular family tourism destinations for enjoying the beauty of nature,” they add.|0|
BJP, RSS workers unleash wave of protest|MALAPPURAM|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|BJP and RSS activists unleashed a wave of protests across the district on Wednesday as part of their Statewide agitation against the entry of two young women to the Sabarimala Ayyappa temple. Protesters attacked KSRTC buses at several places. Police showed maximum restraint to prevent an open showdown with the belligerent protesters who blocked roads at several places. The protesters staged a sit-in at Angadipuram and burned Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s effigy. Women protesters were seen beating the effigy with brooms. The protesters showered abuses on the government. Police provided security cover to the house of Kanakadurga at Angadipuram. Ms. Kanakadurga had entered Sabarimala temple along with her friend Bindu on Wednesday morning with police security. The protests by RSS men strengthened by Wednesday evening, triggering tension at several places. Shops to be opened Meanwhile, traders under the banner of the Kerala Vyapari Vyavayi Ekopana Samiti decided to open their shops and business establishments on Thursday, rejecting the hartal call by the Sabarimala Karma Samiti. Traders said here that they were not against any particular group or organisation, but they would not support any group disrupting business and people’s lives. Ms. Durga’s family alleged a conspiracy by the police and the CPI(M) in taking the two women to the Sabarimala temple. Her brother Bharat Bushan said that the police had lodged her in an unknown destination for about a week without allowing the family to contact her.|0|
Farmers threaten to boycott market|Kozhikode|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Farmers associated with the Agricultural Urban Wholesale Market at Vengeri have threatened to boycott the biweekly markets in protest against the change in auction timings. The auction committee comprising Agriculture Department officials and representatives of farmers had decided to change the timings of auction conducted every Monday and Thursday to 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. from 12 noon to 3 p.m. More traders The change in timing was mainly to facilitate the participation of more traders in the auction. “However, the change is unsuitable for farmers, especially for those who transport vegetables from far off places in the interiors of the district as well as from Malappuram,” K. Kunhimohammed, a farmer from Manjeri, says. “Farmers have no choice but to boycott the auction markets and sell off the produce at local markets. At present, we are forced to harvest vegetables or fruits a day before the auction. And it is anybody’s guess what happens to the produce. The freshness is lost and traders either purchase vegetables at low rates or refuse to buy them,” Mohammed Haji of Mukkom says. He says the decision to implement the new timings also fell flat. “This was evident when traders failed to turn up at the auction on Monday,” he adds.  Horticorp Even, Mr. Haji says, the Kerala State Horticultural Products Development Corporation (Horticorp), under the Department of Agriculture, buys produce at low rates. The Horticorp was supposed to purchases all unsold vegetables from the market at rates 10% higher than in the open market, he points out. On Monday, he says, the ‘poovan banana’ was sold at Rs. 35 per kg; ‘njalipoovan pazham’ for Rs. 30 and ‘robusta pazham’ for Rs. 20. “ Why should a farmer transport his produce and sell them at low rates ?” he asks About 200 farmers from Malappuram, Kannur, Palakkad and Kozhikode have registered with the Vengeri market. The Agriculture Department had also stopped the transport subsidy a few months ago. Besides, the Hortcorp has not yet given money to farmers for the vegetables purchased from them. However, Narayanan Kalpakassery, chairman of Sangha Maithri, an apex body of farmers’ clubs, and convener of the auction committee, says the decision to change the timings was taken by the auction committee involving farmers. The decision was taken so that both farmers and traders would mutually benefit. Any move to reverse the decision has to be taken by the committee, he adds.  The change is unsuitable for farmers, especially for those who transport vegetables from far off places|0|

Action committee flays move to hold hearing on quarry|Kozhikode|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|"The Kottur grama panchayat authorities and the Chengottumala People's Action Committee have flayed the decision of the District Industries Department to conduct a hearing in the presence of the District Collector to discuss the disputes over quarrying and the operation of crushers at Chengottumala in Koyilandy taluk. Action council leaders said the hearing scheduled for January 3 was illegal and the violation of all the standing orders of the Kerala High Court. The action council leaders said the hearing to be chaired by the District Collector was planned by the Industries Department ignoring the fact that the case was now under the consideration of the High Court. ‘Facts covered up’ Jayaraj, one of the action council leaders, said the matter had already been brought to the attention of the District Collector by their representatives and the panchayat authorities. He alleged that the hearing was planned by covering up many facts and meant to bypass all the standing orders against quarrying. Mr. Jayaraj said the private company that purchased large areas of land in the hillock was trying to win the licence for the project through crooked ways. ""We had staged a series of protests against the project and its impact on the people. The latest hearing is also an attempt to secure the nod for the project evading the court,"" he claimed. K.M. Biju, a resident of the area, said hundreds of families in the panchayat were apprehensive of the project and they wanted all permissions already given to the quarry operators cancelled. They had already staged numerous protests in the area with their demand and called upon the Mining and Geology department to review the applications previously submitted by the quarry operators."|0|
Warning to be issued to keep off Edayar estuary|Thiruvananthapuram|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|A warning will be issued through the Coastal Vigilance Committees (Kadalora Jagratha Samiti) to keep people away from the dangerous waters at the point where the river drains into the sea at Edayar, Panathura. The decision was taken in the wake of the death by drowning of four Beemapally residents on Tuesday, the police said. ''This is a place where even the local fishermen are wary of taking a dip. There are eddies and strong currents which make it a dangerous spot even for people who know how to swim,” said Saji Kumar, Circle Inspector, Poonthura. The plan is to issue the warning through the Coastal Vigilance Committees and the churches and mosques in the region, he said. Remote area The committees consist of local fishermen and coastal inhabitants. “'The local people are quite aware of the danger and they stay away. It is also a relatively remote and thinly-populated region,”' the officer said. In fact, on Tuesday, the local fishermen had come to know of the accident only after one of the victims, Ali Mukthar, washed up on the beach. The 19-year-old, also from Beemapally, survived the ordeal, but four of his friends did not. Not as dangerous According to the police, other spots with a ‘Pozhi’ (estuary with sandbar) in the district are not as dangerous as the one at Panathura.  There are eddies and strong currents making it a dangerous spot even for expert swimmers|0|
Traders vow to keep their shops open|Kozhikode|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The business community, which had last month resolved to observe 2019 as ‘anti-hartal year’, on Wednesday decided not to down shutters during Thursday’s State-wide hartal announced by Sangh Parivar outfits. The Hartal Virudha Koottayma (the anti-hartal collective), a platform of 92 organisations of merchants, traders, restaurateurs, bus and lorry operators, said its affiliates would run their services on Thursday. BJP threat However, BJP leaders in Kozhikode have threatened the business community to forcibly get the shops and businesses closed. “If anyone is planning to open their shops on Thursday, they will have to face the consequences,” BJP Kozhikode district president T.P. Jayachandran has warned. T. Nazirudheen, president of the Kerala Vayapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samiti, which is the leading member of the Koottayma, toldThe Hinduthat the Samiti had urged the Chief Minister to provide protection to all the businesses on the hartal day. He said district leaders of his Samiti would tour all the 14 districts to encourage the businesses to remain open. Samiti units had been asked to videograph any violence or attacks against any business unit and present the evidence before courts and other authorities. “Our decision to keep open our shops and businesses on the hartal day has nothing to do with the Sabarimala issue,” Mr. Nazirudeen said. “It is born out of the denial of our right to earn our daily bread and butter.” He said the business community, which was the biggest sufferers of any hartal or strike, was tired of the frequent hartals. He noted that because of the ongoing economic recession in Kerala, businesses were very badly hit. The frequent hartals, several in each month, had worsened their woes. It was following last month's flash hartal forced by the Sangh Parivar against the alleged immolation of a middle-aged man in Thiruvananthapuram that the Hartal Virudha Koottayma decided to observe 2019 as anti-hartal year. However, the Bus Operators Organisation indicated that its members would not operate buses on Thursday. K. Radhakrishnan, general secretary, toldThe Hinduthat since the organisation feared violence and huge damage to their buses, the nearly 700 buses owned by the organisation members might not be on the road. But tour vehicle operators, chambers of commerce and host of other business outfits have asserted that they would keep their businesses and services open on the hartal day.|0|

Swachh Bharat: Corpn. to apply for two-star rating|Kozhikode|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Kozhikode Municipal Corporation will apply for a two-star rating under the Swachh Bharat Mission in 2019. The Corporation council has decided to submit the application before January 4. However, the public will have a few more days to point out any problems related to waste management in the city, so that the Corporation could correct them before ranking is confirmed. “Urban spaces in the country are given rating up to seven stars based on several parameters. Kozhikode qualifies for the two-star rating,” said Corporation Health Officer R.S. Gopakumar. The parameters being considered for the rating include door-to-door garbage collection system, source-level waste segregation, effectiveness of waste management, status of scientific landfills, plastic waste management, construction and demolition management, and a citizen grievance redressal system. “Our door-to-door collection system covers only 60% of the city, while 100% coverage is needed for a three-star city. Once the Green Task Force comes into effect in about three months, we will be qualified to apply for three-star,” Dr. Gopakumar said. Kozhikode has already declared itself open defecation free (ODF), another parameter required for the three-star status. This will enable the Corporation to apply for three-star rating next year. However, only a proper sewage treatment mechanism will help the city qualify for any higher ranking. Kozhikode can declare itself a two-star city in a step-by-step process. First, ward councillors should declare each ward as a waste-free ward and then the Corporation council can declare the city waste-free. Once the public opinion is also taken care of, the city can make the final declaration. However, if Kozhikode is aiming at three-star or five-star rating, it will have to undergo an additional verification by an independent agency under the Ministry of Housing and Urban affairs.|0|

Shops remained closed on both sides of the street - a mark of respect to the departed. Minutes later, the sound of prayers rose from the mosque, reminding everyone present how much a day of sorrow it was for the tight-knit community in this small but thickly-populated locality. On Tuesday evening, Beemapally residents had been shocked to learn that the turbulent estuarine waters at Edayar, Panathura, had claimed the lives of four youngsters during New Year festivities.

HC stays ban on online sale of drugs|CHENNAI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|A Division Bench of the Madras High Court on Wednesday stayed the operation of a single judge’s December 17 order banning online sale of medicines. Though the Centre was yet to notify statutory rules for regulating such sales, imposing a sudden ban would cause grave hardship and health issues to patients relying on e-pharmacies, the Bench said. Passing interim orders on a batch of writ appeals preferred by e-pharma firms, Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and P. Rajamanickam said the number of people who prefer to purchase medicines online was on the rise because not all patients and their caregivers would be in a position to go in search of the required drugs. They also recorded the submission of senior counsel P.S. Raman that e-pharmacies aided those who travelled from one State to another for medical treatment. “A patient from Assam might get treated at a hospital in Tamil Nadu and the drugs prescribed by the doctors here may not be available in the northeastern State. “In such cases, e-pharmacies play a crucial role by procuring the drugs from the nearest possible location like West Bengal and delivering it to the patient through courier and other services,” Mr. Raman had argued while appealing the single judge’s order banning online sales till the Centre notifies the statutory rules. “Of course sale/dispensation of medicines requires great care... as it deals with human lives,” the Bench observed, recording the assurance given by senior counsel P.R. Raman and others that there was no possibility of any irregularity or illegality as medicines would not be dispensed online without buyers having furnished prescriptions from registered medical practitioners. Writing the interim order for the Bench, Justice Sathyanarayanan said there was no necessity to ban online sale in toto when e-pharma firms had conceded that the authorities constituted under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act of 1940 were already empowered to initiate appropriate action against them.|0|
Mullappally sees conspiracy|THIRUVANANTHAPURAM|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The entry of two young women to Sabarimala on Wednesday could only be seen as the climax of the women’s wall sponsored by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president Mullappally Ramachandran has said. Mr.Ramachandran told reporters in Delhi on Wednesday that it was an operation planned and executed by Mr. Vijayan. The decision was made along with the proposal to form the women’s wall. This was a political conspiracy to gain political advantage. The secret agenda of the CPI(M), the BJP, and the Sangh Parivar organisations to create violence and chaos and thus promote their political interest now stood exposed. The BJP’s intention was to create another Ayodhya and the CPI(M)’s to create violence and unrest to divert attention from its administrative failures, he said. The Sabarimala issue was being used as a ploy by Mr.Vijayan to divert attention from the problems affecting the people, mainly post-flood issues. The government had failed in the relief and rehabilitation of the flood victims, he said. Suo motu The Kerala State Women’s Commission has taken a suo motu case in connection with the attack on women mediapersons in the violence over the entry of women to Sabarimala on Wednesday.|0|

Vigilance report reveals lapses in departments|GUNTUR|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Regional Vigilance and Enforcement Office here has estimated that a sum of Rs. 177 crore in the form of tax arrears is to be credited to the State exchequer at the end of inspections held in the year that just ended. The arrears include university common fees (Rs. 8.24 crore), non-payment of customer charges (Rs. 13.87 crore), Indiramma Housing Scheme (non-payment of housing loans — Rs. 41.06 crore) and non-payment of various charges from urban local bodies (Rs. 17.35 crore).

Telangana takes serious note of A.P.’s white papers|HYDERABAD|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The State government has taken a serious note of the views articulated by the neighbouring Andhra Pradesh government relating to bifurcation of assets, especially Schedule IX and X institutions between the two States post bifurcation. The Andhra Pradesh government, in its series of white papers, said that the bifurcation of the Schedule IX and X institutions was not completed because of the non-cooperation by the Centre and the Telangana government. The white paper said the expert committee constituted on division of assets and liabilities of 85 institutions and the AP government had issued orders for division of assets, liabilities and employees in respect of 41 institutions in line with the recommendations of the expert committee. “However, no institution is so far bifurcated due to non-cooperation from the Government of India and Government of Telangana,” the white paper said. The same was the case regarding the division of 142 State institutions that remained unsettled till date due to non-cooperation from the Centre and the Telangana government, the AP government said in its publication. AP’s interpretation Senior officials pointed out that the AP government was interpreting the definitions, like headquarters assets, given in the Reorganisation Act in its favour. According to Section 75 of the Act, the governments are mandated to continue to provide services of the institution located under their purview to the other State. The Telangana government had expressed its willingness to resolve the issues amicably in a manner that would not adversely affect the interests of Telangana and the same was communicated to the Joint Parliamentary Committee headed by former Union minister P. Chidambaram. Sources said the views articulated in the white papers had been referred to the State Reorganisation wing and the officials concerned are reported to have been asked to prepare a detailed note on the issue giving clarity about the State’s stand on the pending issues.  However, no institution is so far bifurcated due to non-cooperation from the Government of India and Government of Telangana White paper published by AP government|0|

Public service vehicles to get time to install panic button|Bengaluru|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Transport Department has said that owners of public service vehicles such as buses and cabs will be given a “reasonable amount of time” to comply with the mandatory installation of vehicle tracking system and panic button. After being directed by the Union government, the department made the device installation mandatory for newly registered vehicles with effect from January 1. On Wednesday, Transport Minister D.C. Thammanna, who inaugurated the initiative at Yeshwantpur RTO, said in the coming days, device installation would be mandatory for vehicles already registered in the State. The device, developed by BSNL, will cost Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 12,000. The Minster said the State government would approach the Centre to reduce the cost if the vehicle owners find the device too expensive. Department officials said the device would help ensure safety of passengers, especially women, and help reduce accidents as vehicles can be monitored for rash driving and other offences. Transport Commissioner V.P. Ikkeri toldThe Hinduthat the time frame for installation of vehicle tracking system and panic button would be decided depending on the age of the vehicle. “We will give a reasonable time for the owners to install the device mandated by the Union government. There are talks of imposing a ban on vehicles older than 15 years from plying on the road. We have to consider this issue as well while implementing the new rules. The department will come up with a plan on the time frame and action that needs to be taken on vehicle owners who fail to follow the directions,” he said. While issuing the notification, the Centre had given the liberty to the State to come up with rules on fixing the deadline for the vehicles already registered. The State has over 3.37 lakh maxi-cabs and other taxis, out of which 1.68 lakh are registered with RTOs in Bengaluru. Over 1.06 lakh buses registered in the State are operated as stage carriages, contract carriages, and private service vehicles. In Bengaluru, 48,899 buses are registered. It has also become mandatory for the State road transport corporations such as the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) to comply with the rules. The KSRTC has a fleet of over 8,700 buses. The Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC), which has a fleet of over 6,600 buses, is gearing up to comply with the rules. N.V. Prasad, MD, BMTC, said the buses were already fitted with GPS and installation of the panic button would be done in the coming days.

‘Modi has cheated the State’|CHITTOOR|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Exhorting people to defeat the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre in the general elections, Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu has said the need of the hour is to “protect the nation and the State from betrayal of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.” Addressing a public meeting at Kuppam after launching the sixth phase of the Janmabhoomi - Maa Vooru programme, Mr. Naidu said he was angered and pained as Mr. Modi betrayed the State and its people. Dig at KCR, Jagan “Mr. Modi, Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and YSRCP president Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy are acting in tandem, albeit surreptitiously, with a view to scuttling the development of Andhra Pradesh. “The three leaders are jealous of the rapid strides being made by the State in spite of financial stringency,” Mr Naidu said, and dwelt at length the development and welfare activities his government had initiated in the last over four years. Stating that he had opposed the release of high-denomination currency notes, Mr. Naidu alleged that “demonetisation and GST have destabilised the country’s economy and devastated the banking sector.” Referring to the Rafale deal, he said, “Under Mr. Modi’s rule, the country’s security is at stake.” I-T raids The Centre would not mind resorting to tapping the phones of TDP leaders, he said, and cited the Income-Tax and Enforcement Directorate raids on the party functionaries to drive home his point. The “political doublespeak” of the BJP on issues such as triple talaq and women devotees’ entry into the Sabarimala temple was deplorable, he said. Explaining the circumstances that had forced the TDP to quit the NDA, Mr. Naidu said non-fulfilment of the provisions of the State Reorganisation Act and denying funds that were legitimately due to the State tantamount to betrayal. “Denial of steel plant to the Rayalaseema region and Dugarajapatnam port has forced us to look for alternatives,” Mr. Naidu added. Training his guns on Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy, the Chief Minister said that the Opposition leader had completely surrendered to the Prime Minister to save himself from court cases. Terming the verbal attack of Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao against him as “indecent and uncivilised,” Mr. Naidu said he was ready to bear the humiliation for the sake of the people of the State. Appeal to JSP Interestingly, Mr. Naidu going soft on Jana Sena Party president Pawan Kalyan came as a surprise. “The JSP’s fact-finding committee had stated that Rs. 70,000 crore was due to the State. Mr. Pawan has to question the betrayal of the Centre and cooperate with us,” Mr. Naidu said. Thanking the people of Kuppam for reposing faith in him in every election, Mr. Naidu said, “There is some disenchantment among the people here that I am not frequently visiting the constituency. However, wherever I may be, my heart is with you.”|0|
Azharuddin scotches rumours of joining TRS|Hyderabad|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Telangana Congress Committee working president and former Indian cricketer Mohd. Azharuddin has denied that he is joining the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS). After the rumours started doing rounds that Mr. Azaharuddin has been offered the Secunderabad Lok Sabha seat to contest on the TRS ticket, the former Indian cricket captain took to twitter and denied any such move. “The news doing the rounds in the media of me joining the TRS party in Telangana is incorrect & false,” he tweeted on his official account thus putting an end to rumours. Party sources said that Mr. Azharuddin’s name was linked to TRS after he attended the marriage of daughter of Hyderabad Member of Parliament Asaduddin Owaisi. Social gathering He was seen along with TRS working president K.T. Rama Rao and Mr. Owaisi at the marriage. But even attending functions of leaders of other political parties is being viewed with suspicion now and people are posting such pictures and writing their comments. But such comments are not facts, a senior leader said. TPCC Minorities Department chairman Shaik Abdullah Sohail, said at a press conference here that Mr. Azharuddin personally spoke to him this morning and denied reports that appeared in a section of media on the reports. He said the TRS was deliberately spreading rumours targeting many Congress leaders. He said it was strange that despite winning two Assembly elections since 2014 TRS has failed to groom leadership of its own and was luring Congress leaders to fill that vacuum.|0|
Exotic trees eating up Western Ghat’s grasslands|Kochi|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The new year heralds bad news for the high-altitude grasslands of the Western Ghats. Over four decades, the country lost almost one-fourth of these grasslands and exotic invasive trees are primarily to blame, find scientists. Though grassland afforestation using pine, acacia and eucalyptus ceased in 1996, the exotics still invade these ecosystems, confirms a study published on January 2 in the international journal Biological Conservation. When satellite images revealed to a team including scientists from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER, Tirupati) grassland loss in Tamil Nadu’s Palani hills in early 2018, they decided to study how shola-grasslands (characterised by patches of stunted evergreen shola trees in the valleys and grasslands on hill slopes) across the Ghats – from the Baba Budan Hills in Karnataka to Tamil Nadu's Ashambu Hills – changed in extent between 1972 and 2017. The satellite images they accessed reveal that 60% of the shola-grassland landscape has changed; almost 40% (516 km2) of native high-elevation grasslands have disappeared. Most of this loss occurred on the mountain tops of the Nilgiri, Palani and Anamalai hill ranges, which comprise more than half of the Ghat’s shola-grassland ecosystems, primarily due to the expansion of exotic trees (pine, acacia and eucalyptus). Even though no plantations were established between 2003 and 2017, invasion by existing trees increased areas under exotic plantations by 27% in the Palanis and 17% in the Nilgiris. Broadly, shola-grassland ecosystems in Tamil Nadu showed the highest rates of invasion. The researchers also visited 840 locations across the Ghats to confirm these changes. Despite this, there’s some good news: shola forests have remained “relatively unchanged” over these years. The Anamalai-Munnar areas have also remained stable during this time. ‘Little research focus’ However, all possible efforts must be made to conserve the remaining grassland tracts, said scientist Dr. Robin V. Vijayan (IISER Tirupati), one of the authors who led the study. “There is very little research focus on grasslands and mechanisms to restore them are also few, unlike forests,” he added. “The immediate reaction would be to remove all exotics including mature plantations from grasslands but that should not be done,” said Godwin Vasanth Bosco, who has restored some grassland patches in Udhagamandalam.|0|
Vehicle buyers taken for a ride|Hyderabad|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Hundreds of Hyderabadis are being duped by gangs of miscreants from Rajasthan in the name of selling second-hand two-wheelers, well-maintained cars or electronics for throwaway prices on OLX, an online classified platform. In the first two days of the new year alone, the Cyber Crime police have reportedly received nearly 10 complaints. Last year, around 130 such cases were filed, all with the same modus operandi. “Bharatpur gang is looting people across the country on the pretext of selling used automobiles and electronic items,” said a senior cyber crime police officer. He said the miscreants, in the guise of defence personnel or claiming that they are selling vehicles in an emergency, show buyers the photos and registration documents online, and ask them for advance payment via Paytm or Google Pay. Once they receive the entire money, they switch off their mobile phones and go untraceable, the investigator said.  Hostile locals The Hyderabad police’s earlier efforts to nab the culprits at Bharatpur went in vain, as the fraudsters escaped allegedly on a tip-off by the local police, the officer said. In December last, a team of over 25 police personnel led by four inspector-rank officers had gone to Bharatpur to nab the fraudsters. However, due to lack of support from the local police in the unfamiliar area, they had to return empty-handed to Hyderabad. Recently, an instructor attached to the Army training centre at Golconda, who was planning to buy a Royal Enfield bike, was duped by the same gang for Rs. 80,000. “He (culprit) informed us that he is a CISF officer at Shamshabad airport and asked to pick up the bike from the airport parking area on December 31 morning. I waited for him till sunset and returned home,” said the Army instructor, who was at the Hyderabad Cyber Crime police station on Wednesday afternoon. The officer transferred the amount through Google Pay and said that the culprit was still in touch with him. A mason from Shaikpet and a butcher also claimed that they were cheated by a person pretending to be an Army officer. Awareness campaigns When contacted, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Detective Department) Avinash Mohanty said of late, OLX frauds have increased in Hyderabad and police were conducting awareness campaigns as a precautionary measure. “While purchasing something, people should verify the details of the seller before transferring the money. Our teams are working round-the-clock to nab the culprits,” he said. Mr. Mohanty said most of the cyber crime fraudsters are from other States and they pose themselves as Army officers or staff of any other uniform service. They usually post ads on OLX with attractive photographs of the vehicles to be sold at throwaway prices and provide their contact numbers. “When a prospective buyer contacts them, they ask them to transfer the money saying that the vehicle will be delivered soon and dupe them,” the officer said.  While purchasing something, people should verify the details of the seller before transferring money to his/her account. Avinash Mohanty Deputy Commissioner of Police (Detective Department)|0|

Vontimitta temple: work picks up pace|KADAPA|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Work with regard to implementation of the master plan at Sri Kodandaramalayam at Vontimitta is progressing at a brisk pace and everything is set to be ready for the ensuing Brahmotsavam. After taking over the shrine, The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) offered to pump in Rs. 100 crore towards developing it on the lines of Bhadrachalam in the combined State. Work worth Rs. 17.6 crore is already completed and projects costing Rs. 9 crore are in various stages of progress. A sum of Rs. 3 crore is spent every year on the conduct of ‘Sri Sita Rama Kalyanam’ as a State celebration. Mada streets TTD Executive Officer Anil Kumar Singhal, who visited the temple on Wednesday, inspected the ongoing wiring and lighting works. He announced that ‘kalyana vedika’, parking lot and toilets would be developed on a permanent basis, keeping in view the past experiences. Apart from expediting work on queue lines, the ‘Mada Streets’ around the temple would be widened to enable conduct of religious processions in future. “With the introduction of time-slot darshan at Tirumala, the visiting pilgrims are getting enough free time for nearby temples. As a result, footfall at Vontimitta has increased,” Mr. Singhal said. Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has offered to refurbish the kitchen (Potu) and flooring without damaging the aesthetics and originality of the temple.|0|
KCR beats NTR’s record in running government without Cabinet|HYDERABAD|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The year book has turned a new leaf but Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, who took oath as the Chief Minister for the second term on December 13 last year, is yet to constitute his Cabinet. In the process, Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao may have well created a new record, re-writing the old record of late N. T. Rama Rao, the first non-Congress Chief Minister of the combined State of Andhra Pradesh. Mr. Rama Rao had functioned alone for 17 days after he dismissed his entire 31-member Cabinet in 1989 taking a strong exception to the leakage of budget proposals to the Press before it was presented in the Legislative Assembly. A new 23-member team was brought in subsequently by NTR after 17 days, retired bureaucrats recalled. It created a flutter those days that the Chief Minister had dismissed the entire Cabinet and ran the administration single handedly. When some one pointed out to the then Chief Secretary G.R. Nair that there was no government in the State, he was believed to have replied that Chief Minister himself was the government and wherever the Chief Minister went, the government functioned from there!  One minister Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao, however, is not alone as he has the company of a Minister Mohammed Mahmood Ali who was administered oath of office along with the Chief Minister by Governor E.S.L.Narasimhan. Mr. Ali was one of the two Deputy Chief Ministers in the first term and had handled Revenue. He has been entrusted with Home portfolio this time round. Initially, it was expected that a new Cabinet, though a small team with seven or eight ministers would be in place within a week. Now, other member were expected to be inducted into the Cabinet mostly after Sankranthi festival for want of auspicious days. It is already 20 days since Mr. Rao is at the helm as the CM. Nevertheless, the Chief Minister has been pretty active as he has been holding continuous meetings with officials on Irrigation, Agriculture, Haritha Haram (plantation drive to improve forest cover) and holding deliberations over implementation of electoral promises. “Technically there is no Cabinet as yet, but it has no impact on the administration as the CM has a hands on knowledge and information about all departments,” official sources maintained.|0|
Vundavalli ready for debate on white papers|KAKINADA|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Wondering why the State government did not release a White Paper on the Polavaram irrigation project, former MP of Rajamahendravaram Vundavilli Arun Kumar on Wednesday invited representatives of the State government for an open discussion on the White Papers. “All the White Papers are far from reality, and the one on industrial development is a classic example to showcase this. The government claimed investments to the tune of Rs. 18 lakh crore in the last over four years. I doubt whether the actual figure is at least 10% of it,” he said while addressing the media in Rajamahendravaram. Mr. Kumar said he was ready to visit the industries that were established if addresses were given.|0|
State tops in implementation of welfare schemes: Yanamala|KAKINADA|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Protests from the residents of a few villages demanding re-carpeting of roads and uninterrupted power supply marred the sixth round of ‘Janmabhoomi-Maa Ooru’ programme which was launched all over the East Godavari district on Wednesday. Kick-starting the programme at Tuni town, Finance Minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu said that Andhra Pradesh stood top in the country with regard to the implementation of welfare programmes. “The State government is implementing as many as 105 welfare schemes,” he said. “The government has implemented farm loan waiver to the tune of Rs. 24,000 crore and the next instalment of Rs. 8,000 crore will be released soon. The aim is to ensure that each and every family earn a minimum monthly income of Rs. 10,000, for which different schemes and welfare programmes are being implemented,” he said. Accusing the Central government of failing to implement the assurances given to the State, the Finance Minister said that the Centre’s nonchalant attitude prompted the Telugu Desam Party to quit the National Democratic Alliance. He said that in the last four and a half years, the salaries of the government employees and the outsourcing staff were increased and the welfare schemes were designed and implemented for all sections. Call to public The Minister called upon the public to cast their vote to the Telugu Desam Party in the general elections scheduled to be held in the next six months. Meanwhile, residents of Gadarada village in Korukonda mandal obstructed the entry of officers into their village, demanding that the long-pending problem of uninterrupted power supply be addressed first. Farmers from the village staged a protest by blocking the road. The meeting, however, was held under police protection but the villagers did not turn up for it. Uppada Kothapalli MPTC Peerla Satyavathi and her husband Gangadhar, along with the residents of Ramanakkapeta and Sriramapuram, prevented Pithapuram MLA S.V.S.N. Varma from entering into the villages, as the long-pending problems in the villages remained unaddressed. At Pasumilli village near Ambajipeta, the villagers staged a walkout from the meeting, demanding that the local MLA visit their village and answer to their queries on unfulfilled assurances.|0|
Hospitals shut the door on NTR Vaidya Seva|Vijayawada|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Private hospitals rendering services under the NTR Vaidya Seva Health scheme to white-card holder, government employees and journalists have put up notices saying they are unable to continue as the bills are not being cleared on time. The beneficiaries particularly the white-cardholders are in a state of confusion as several network hospitals are turning them away. The hospitals claim they are attending to emergency cases. NTR Vaidya Seva Trust Chief Executive Officer N Subba Rao however told the media that the Finance department was poised to approve Rs. 100 crore to clear bills to hospitals for treating the white-cardholders and anther Rs. 100 crore for treating the employees. He said the crisis would blow over in a couple of days. The Andhra Pradesh Hospitals Association (ASHA) sources said this was unlikely because the Trust was due to hospitals nearly Rs. 500 crore: Rs. 300 crore for the white-cardholders and Rs. 180 crore for the employees. The State government has allocated Rs. 1,000 crore for the NTR Vaidya Seva Trust to treat 2.6 lakh beneficiaries through a network of 435 private hospitals. Besides the clearing of the bills, ASHA had other demands on which it wanted the State government to give an assurance. It primarily wanted the Trust to pay 70% of the claim amount immediately after its submission. The association also demanded hiking of tariffs for different ‘packages’, bringing of the ‘Arogyarakshna’ rates on a par with the Employees Health Scheme, payment of separate tariffs for emergency services, clarity on the ‘Thalli Suraksha Scheme’ and hiking of quality incentives.|0|

Turtles dying before reaching destination|MACHILIPATNAM|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Many of the first batch of olive ridley turtles that chose the Andhra Pradesh coast for the annual breeding season have died before they reached the destination, after being trapped in fishing nets. The coast, considered a safe breeding zone, is now witnessing deaths among the migrating turtles in recent years. The average lifespan of the turtle is 50. The conservation status of the animal is ‘vulnerable’ and their population faces various threats according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The breeding season normally commences in January and the conservation authorities prepare the ground for the season until mid-summer. “We try our best to release the turtles back into the sea if they are trapped in our nets. In many cases, they are dead by the time we notice them,” a fisherman toldThe Hindu. The prime reason for the rise in the deaths is the absence of the ‘Turtle Excluder Device’ in fishing operations. The Wildlife authorities have identified 12 locations to set up rookeries between the Krishna and the Koringa wildlife sanctuaries, which witness a huge turnout of turtles. Rookeries coming up “Seven rookeries will come up in the East Godavari district and five in the Krishna sanctuary alone,” Divisional Forest Officer (Wildlife-Eluru) Ananth Shankar said. Official teams at the rookeries are sent to save them from stray dogs and conserve the eggs. The hatchlings will be released into the sea in a phased manner.|0|

Action against TV channel sought|Kozhikode|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Muslim Students Federation (MSF), the students’ wing of the Indian Union Muslim League, has sought action against a private television channel which recently telecast visuals of festivities on a college campus in Thiruvananthapuram portraying them as activities of terror outfit Al-Qaeda. ‘Sangh agenda’ MSF State president Mishab Keezhariyur and general secretary M.P. Navas told the media on Wednesday that the news report was part of the “Sangh Parivar agenda to perpetuate communalism”. The students had attended the festivities wearing black dress and taken out a bike rally on the campus to welcome actor Salim Kumar. The channel reported that the campus was in the grip of Islamic terrorism and the students were being drawn to the Al-Qaeda. A police inquiry disproved the claims later. To lodge complaints The MSF leaders said the organisation would lodge complaints against the channel with the State Police Chief, the departments of Home and Information and Public Relations and the Broadcasting Authority of India. Mr. Mishab accused the State government of keeping mum on the issue. To hold ‘black fest’ The MSF would organise ‘black fest’ on campuses across the State where students would wear black dress to register their protest.|0|
Total LPG coverage is Chittoor’s next goal|Tirupati|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Having already been declared a ‘smokeless district’, Chittoor has now set its sights on ensuring saturation in terms of LPG distribution to the nooks and corners of the district. At 99.07%, Chittoor stands third in the State in terms of LPG penetration, next only to Guntur (100.69%) and Anantapur (99.86%), as on December 1, 2018. Ever since the ‘Deepam’ scheme was launched in 1999, the district has slowly but steadily replaced the traditional ‘chullah’ in the rural kitchen. The recent game-changer was the introduction of ‘Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana’ (PMUY) that initially aimed to provide five crore deposit-free LPG connections to BPL women, which was subsequently raised to cover eight crore beneficiaries, with a budgetary allocation of Rs. 12,800 crore. Initially, the scheme was meant only for SC/ST, beneficiaries of PM Awas Yojana, Antyodaya Anna Yojana, forest dwellers and Most Backward Classes (MBC), but now it has been opened to all. Of the 11.09 lakh households in the district, 10.98 lakh have LPG as cooking fuel, achieving a robust growth from 79.75% as on 1 April 2016. Now, to achieve the 100% mark, the district is focussing on issuing a second refill to every household by looking beyond the traditional beneficiary base. Dealers ready “Apart from the above set of beneficiaries, we have decided to issue double cylinders to all sections of society, as it will be of great help to them during emergency situations,” says S.N.V. Harikrishna, district nodal officer of PMUY, with an appeal to every LPG consumer with a single cylinder to go for the second. “We are fully prepared to rise to the occasion,” the district LPG dealers’ association president M.P. Naik said. The players are so aggressive that a flexible scheme has been put in place where the poor, who are unable to pay for the 14.2 kg cylinder, can swap it for one or two 5 kg cylinders, which are priced relatively lower. What’s more, the Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), one of the three oil marketing companies, has even announced to conduct a ‘bumper draw’ on April 4 for its customers going for the second connection, offering prizes such as a refrigerator and a mixer to incentivise sales.|0|

According to the officials, on December 31 and January 1, the IML sales stood at 18,918 cases when compared to the 18,457 in 2017 and 17,179 in the previous year. As many as 19,558 cases of beer were sold during the two days when compared to 10,989 and 11,921 in the last year respectively.

On the New Year’s day and on its eve, we had request the customers to form a queue in front of the counters,” a wine shop owner said. But what surprised both the excise department and the wine shop owners was the sky-rocketing sale of beer. “As the weather was chilly, we expected a drop in the sales of beer.

Conclave to support SC/ ST entrepreneurs|TIRUPATI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The National Small Industries Corporation (NSIC) will conduct a State conclave of the National SC-ST Hub at SPMVV’s Indira Priyadarshini auditorium here on January 4, to identify entrepreneurs among the marginalised and support them. Though the Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) have a mandate to channelise 25% of their procurement from the MSME sector, 5% of which has to come from Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) businesspersons, a dearth of skilled entrepreneurs has prompted the centre to attempt at bridging the gap. This conclave, which was held in Visakhatpatnam last year, is part of efforts to bring SC and ST aspirants and CPSEs like the NTPC, the RINL, the HPCL, the HSL, the BEL, the SBI and the Andhra Bank on a common platform. The Telugu Chamber of Commerce and Industry is playing a key role in this endeavour. Minister for Industries N. Amaranatha Reddy will inaugurate the event.|0|
CBI speeds up probe in Ayesha case|VIJAYAWADA|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which booked three court staffers last week on charges of destroying evidence in the Ayesha Meera case, is now preparing to interrogate more people as part of its investigation into the 11-year-old rape and murder case. Acting on the directions of the High Court on November 29, 2018, the CBI launched its probe while the Visakhapatnam Police registered a case against the court employees for destroying evidence. Pidatala Satyam Babu, who was earlier jailed for eight years and was subsequently acquitted, had filed a review petition in the High Court immediately after being awarded life imprisonment by a Mahila Court on September 29, 2010. The Mahila Court received the appeal intimation on January 10, 2011. However, P. Venkat Kumar, a property clerk at the Fourth Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Court in Vijayawada, obtained orders for destroying evidence from the magistrate and executed the same on October 7, 2014 without verifying the intimation of the pending appeal in the High Court. Mahila Court senior assistant Y. Subba Reddy, who had sent the material as part of the records to the High Court, did not send the appeal intimation to the Fourth Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Court, which amounted to criminal conspiracy, criminal breach of trust and other charges. Many questions There are many unanswered questions in the 11-year-old case. A big question is why the Vijayawada City Police, who investigated the case, failed to book a case against the court staff after knowing that the key evidence in the case was destroyed five years ago when an appeal was still pending in the HC. The role of investigating officers in the case as well as the court staff comes into doubt, as there are speculations that money must have changed hands. The HC, while acquitting Satyam Babu, had pulled up the police over the poor investigation into the rape and murder case and had ordered the constitution of a Special Investigation Team (SIT) before handing the case to the CBI. The police too booked a case against the court staff for destroying the evidence only after the HC ordered it to do so. The CBI’s Hyderabad unit is investigating the rape and murder of the B. Pharmacy student. Visakhapatnam CBI officers had questioned some court staff for destroying the evidence, and are planning to grill some others including some officers as part of their investigation. Then Krishna district judge had submitted a report to the High Court Registrar General for destroying the key evidence in the case, on which the CBI has filed a case now.|0|

Release CCS funds or face stir: RTC union|VIJAYAWADA|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Leaders of the AP State Road Transport Corporation’s Employees Union (EU) have demanded immediate release of funds to the tune of Rs. 222 crore, which they said, were collected by the employees from their monthly salaries and deposited in the Credit Cooperative Society (CCS) but diverted by the management. In a statement released on Wednesday, EU’s State president Y.V. Rao and general secretary P. Damodar Rao said the CCS, started by the employees had a turnover of Rs. 1,200 crore. This fund was used to sanction loans for purposes like performing their children’s marriages or for education purpose. But the management diverted the workers’ hard-earned money to the tune of Rs. 215 crore, they alleged, adding that it should immediately release the amount along with an interest of Rs. 7 crore, taking the total amount to Rs. 222 crore, said the statement.  ‘Agonising wait’ The employees’ union leaders threatened a massive strike at the RTC House, if the management failed to concede their demand. They said the society which had been running successfully for the last 66 years, may now incur losses due to the management’s failure to deposit the money deducted from the workers’ salaries. They said in the past, loans were sanctioned within 24 hours from the CCS but that was not the case any more. Several loan applications received in December for Christmas were pending to be sanctioned and now more applications would come during Sankranti, they said.|0|

Chandrababu Naidu dropping hints of a realignment of political forces. Mr. Naidu had at a press conference on Tuesday asked YSRCP president Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy what was wrong “ïf Pawan is on my side”.|0|

Mixed feelings as HC gets down to work|VIJAYAWADA|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Andhra Pradesh High Court (HC) began functioning from its temporary premises at the CM’s camp office on Monday amidst mixed feelings among the legal fraternity of coming back to what is now the capital region after nearly 65 years and being deprived of enough time to shift to Vijayawada. The advocates are apparently dissatisfied with the not-so-good infra and are sceptical of the timely completion of the judicial complex at Nelapadu in Guntur district where the court would be accommodated till the permanent HC complex nearby gets ready . The time and effort involved in physically moving a huge number of ‘case bundles’ from Hyderabad is a major cause for worry. Nevertheless, as per the Presidential Order , the HC started operating with a formal address to 13 judges by Acting Chief Justice C. Praveen Kumar and the judges then getting down to work in the chambers and court halls allotted to them. Court No. 1 headed by Chief Justice Praveen Kumar and Justice M. Satyanarayana Murthy had 19 fresh matters listed consisting of petitions related to the municipal administration and urban development , prohibition and excise, revenue and cooperation departments among others. All India Lawyers’ Union State general secretary N. Srinivasa Rao toldThe Hinduthat more than a lakh cases were to be adjudicated by the HC and only quick transportation of the case bundles would help in a prompt listing. He said the court halls and even the judges’ rooms were congested but he would not raise a hue and cry about it because the adjustment had to be made during the transition period. Apart from the concern about getting accustomed to the new place and finding accommodation, many advocates appeared to be pleased with the arrangements. ‘Better ambience’ “In a way this is better than the one in Hyderabad. The landscaping and ambience make us feel comfortable and also gives us a look into how good the actual complex in Amaravati would be,” said a former government pleader and senior counsel A.V. Sivaiah. “For a temporary facility, the arrangements are more than satisfactory and this being the camp office of the CM in the past feels secure . We are already prepared to cope,” said government pleader attached to Advocate General K.A. Narasimham taking a stroll along the plantations. On the other hand, finding space for parking vehicles turned into a Herculean task for visitors.|0|

‘Jabardast’ gave me recognition as an artiste, says ‘Shaking Seshu’|VISAKHAPATNAM|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|It does not ring a bell for many when one refers to him by his real name Addanki Sesh Kumar. But, say ‘Shaking Seshu’ and immediately, all strike a chord with him as the team leader of the popular comedy tele-show ‘Jabardast’. “I have done around 30 films as a character artiste including the mega hit ‘Rangasthalam’, starring Ram Charan Tej. In ‘Supreme’, I played a full-length role. ‘Cinema Chupistha Mava’ brought me a good recognition. But it was ‘Jabardast’ that gave me the real recognition as an artiste,” Sesh Kumar, who was on a visit to the city on the New Year’s Day, toldThe Hindu. Asked about his entry into the world of glamour, Mr. Sesh Kumar went down on the memory lane. “Tollywood comedian of yesteryear Raja Babu is my first inspiration. I would watch his films a lot during my childhood. I would immerse in trying to get a grip of his portrayal of characters, his mannerisms, gestures and facial expressions. That’s how I learnt to act,” he said. Mr. Sesh Kumar’s father A.E.V.P. Rama Rao was a village ‘karanam’ and used to manage the ‘Sri Rajyalakshmi Touring Talkies’. “My father had a keen interest in films. So no need to say, I had the freedom to watch movies whenever I wanted. After the movie, I would to go back home and narrate the story to everyone. I would mimic the sounds of horse riding and sword fights and the mannerisms of the hero,” Mr. Sesh Kumar said, laughing. Tollywood journey He gives the credit to the people of his village Dulla near Rajamahendravaram for triggering a passion in him to act. “I was barely 10 and I was attracted to mimicry and comedy and later to acting. My villagers would encourage me saying: ‘your narration and mannerisms are very good’ and ask me: “Why don’t you try your luck in films?,” he said. Mr. Sesh Kumar entered the field with popular TV serials such as ‘Abhishekam’, ‘Bharyamani’ and ‘Kumkumarekha’ and later did comedy shows on a television channel. “After seeing my performance in ‘Jabardast’, a film maker told me that I looked like noted character artiste M.S. Narayana and thus began my journey in films,” he said. Mr. Sesh Kumar likes stage performances. “Stage gives me immense pleasure as an artiste as I can see the response of the audience impromptu,” he added.|0|

Vijayashanti’s dig at KCR|Hyderabad|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Congress star campaigner and former MP Vijayashanti took a dig at Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao saying that Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself feigned ignorance of the Federal Front being promoted by KCR and it was time he changed its ideology to reflect BJP’s ideology to get recognition from Mr. Modi. In a statement here, she said one can understand if the Federal Front formula was not understood by other opposition parties but the Prime Minister himself missing the formula is quite intriguing. KCR is quite eloquent in both English and Hindi and yet he could not impress the Prime Minister, so he should take its ideology closer to BJP’s ideology, she said.|0|

No wage labour with fall in cotton yield|ADILABAD|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The drastic fall in yield of cotton has resulted in agriculture labourers losing at least Rs. 1.2 crore in wages pertaining to harvest work in old undivided Adilabad district. The average yield of the commercial crop has fallen by about 40 % against a normal of 20 quintals per hectare and the total production from the nearly 3.6 lakh hectare of cultivated area is expected to be of roughly of the quantum of 36 lakh quintals only. According to the trend, labourers are employed for picking of cotton in about two thirds of the total area, while farmer families themselves harvest the crop in the remaining 1.2 lakh hectare that is mostly located in the tribal heartland. The normal wages for picking cotton are Rs. 5 a kg which usually generate Rs. 2.4 crore as wages but, in the present circumstances, would generate only half of it. “There is hardly any demand for workers owing to the drastic fall in yield. Most of us have uprooted the crop after the first pickings itself as the threat of pink boll worm pest attack also loomed large,” pointed out Addi Ramchander Reddy of Jamidi village in Tamsi mandal of Adilabad district as he talked of the state of the season. Harvesting started in the second half of October and by mid-November it became obvious that the yields would be poor. Election employment There would have been a hue and cry over labourers not getting enough work on the fields had the period not coincided with the Assembly election which saw political parties hiring them. Landge Suresh, a migrant labourer from Kinwat in Maharashtra, pointed out that lower yield has farmers preferring deployment of family members for picking cotton even if it means a delay in harvesting and selling the produce. “It reduces the cost for them but scores of labourers from my villages in Maharashtra are returning without any employment because of this trend,” he added. First picking In most of the pockets in the Agency areas, farmers have not gone in even for the first picking of the crop. One can find fields in which the ‘white gold’ has fallen on the ground evidently as it has not been picked in time. The loss in wages in the four districts corresponds to the area under cotton cultivation. Of the total of about 3.6 lakh hectare under the commercial crop Adilabad district accounts for 1.42 lakh hectare, Kumram Bheem Asifabad for 0.92 lakh hectare, Mancherial for 0.63 lakh hectare and Nirmal for 0.62 lakh hectare.|0|

‘How can voters get back into voters’ list’|HYDERABAD|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Telangana High Court on Wednesday directed the Election Commission of India (ECI) to explain what options do deleted voters have to get included in the voter’s list.

The CJ said the point assumes importances in cases of persons shifting from one State or place to another by virtue of job or profession. The petition was posted to January 22 for next hearing.|0|

‘Expedite compensation to SCCL oustees’|HYDERABAD|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Telangana High Court on Wednesday directed the Khammam district judge to complete disbursal of money to persons whose lands were acquired by Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) in Kommepally and Lankapally villages of Khammam district. A division bench comprising Chief Justice Thottathil B. Radhakrishnan and Justice A. Rajasheker Reddy instructed the district judge to ensure it was completed by January 30 and an action taken report presented to it. When the counsel for the SCCL told the bench that Rs. 51 crore was already deposited in Khammam district towards compensation to the land owners, the CJ sought to know why the money didn’t reach the beneficiaries. Once the Lok Adalat passed an award, it should be complied with, he observed. “Why should there be another set of writ petitions seeking to claim the compensation. We’re not here to generate income for the lawyers,” the CJ said hinting that the beneficiaries should not be put to inconvenience. The counsel for the petitioners B. Rachna Reddy explained to the court that a division bench of the erstwhile Hyderabad HC passed an order to disburse the compensation by June 30, 2018. The district judge was still insisting that beneficiaries should file claim petitions, she said. Making it clear that there was no need for any delay in releasing the money to the beneficiaries, the bench directed the DJ to finish the disbursal. The matter was posted to February 2 for next hearing. 1.87 lakh cases pending Chief Justice Thottathil B. Radhakrishnan on Wednesday said that the Bar and the Bench should pledge to give their best through the different official sectors of judicial governance and administrative management of the newly created High Court. He said the newly constituted HC had an opening balance of 1,87,000 pending cases. Momentum, discipline and equilibrium would be needed to dispense timely justice, he observed. The CJ was speaking at a Full Court meeting held to mark the opening of the separate High Court for Telangana. “Quantitative and qualitative turnover of result-oriented adjudication can be achieved if the Bar and the Bench work as two wheels of a caravan of justice but not as merely two sides of a coin,” he said.|0|

‘Craving for fame motive behind attack on Jagan’|VISAKHAPATNAM|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Giving clarity on the ongoing investigation into the knife attack on Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, city Commissioner of Police Mahesh Chandra Laddha said the attacker J. Srinivasa Rao, had done it only to gain publicity. Addressing the media here on Wednesday, Mr. Laddha said the attacker appeared to be suffering from split personality syndrome and his entire focus was to become famous overnight. Mr. Jagan sustained an injury in the arm, when he was attacked by Srinivasa Rao in the VVIP lounge of the city airport with a blade that is used in rooster fights, on October 25 last year. Mr. Laddha said after examining about 92 witnesses it had emerged that the accused, who worked in a restaurant inside the airport, had been planning the attack for over two months. One of the witnesses by name S. Ammaji, a friend of the accused, has recorded that a couple of weeks ago before the attack, Srinivasa Rao had told her that very soon he would become ‘very popular.’ He took the help of his friends Vijaya Durga and Revathipathi to draft a 10-page letter, in which he highlighted a series of issues plaguing the people of the State. On the ‘D’ day, he personally wrote the 11th page in the restaurant, in which he said if he was killed in his mission, no one is to be blamed. Photo op “Prior to that, he had requested Ms. Hemalatha, a colleague, to arrange for a photo-op with Mr. Jagan and she obliged. He chose Ms. Hemalatha as she was known to Krishna Kanth alias KK who works as office assistant in the local YSRCP office,” said Mr. Laddha. The CP said that Srinivasa Rao was a follower of Mr. Jagan and he knew about the YSRCP chief’s schedule. The accused had confessed that he only wanted to inflict a minor injury on Mr. Jagan. The possibility of sending him for psychiatric evaluation was being explored, he added.|1|over two
GHMC officials have new targets to meet|HYDERABAD|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|In what could open the floodgates of corruption in the GHMC, instructions have been issued recently to circle-level officials fixing targets for spot fines, in the name of Swachh Bharat Mission. During a review meeting held by Commissioner M. Dana Kishore on Swachh Survekshan-2019 on Tuesday, instructions have been issued to Deputy Commissioners and Assistant Medical Officers of Health (AMOH) for imposition of penalties for a variety of violations. In January, each circle has been asked to identify a minimum of 500 instances of violations and levy penalties accordingly. Offences include open dumping of garbage, open littering, open urination, dumping of construction and demolition waste, letting out soiled water onto the road, use of plastic bags less than 50 microns in thickness, and display of illegal flexis and banners. Another circular, issued about a fortnight ago, asked the AMOHs of all the circles to crack down on violators for littering in public spaces, roads and in front of shops, throwing waste in drains, open urination and dumping of C&D waste. The circular fixed weekly targets for spot fines for each of these violations — a minimum of 10 instances each of C&D waste dumping, burning of garbage, open urination, and littering of nalas and public spaces, and 20 instances of littering. Penalties to be imposed for various offences range between Rs. 100 and Rs. 10,000, the minimum being for littering of roads and open spaces, and the maximum for dumping of unauthorised debris and garbage in nalas or drains. Estimates suggest that such imposition of penalties could fetch the corporation about Rs. 50 lakh per month on an average. It is to be noted that even while the GHMC Act prescribes penalties for violations, urban infrastructure in the city is still a far cry from basic expectations. For instance, the city is miles away from achieving the central stipulation about availability of one public toilet for every 500 meters. Provision of twin bins in public spaces too is wanting not only in numbers, but also in that they are not regularly cleared of refuse. Besides, the C&D waste processing plants are yet to be functional in the two locations designated for them. Officials inform that the penalties are being imposed as per the Swachh Bharat guidelines, in view of the Swachh Survekshan-2019 rankings in the offing. Mr. Dana Kishore, when contacted, said that the move had to be taken at some point, as there have been plenty of violations everywhere. He particularly expressed annoyance at roads getting damaged with water recklessly let out from residential and commercial establishments.|0|
Farmers say no to greenfield project|KHAMMAM|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Raising their voices against the proposed Khammam-Devarapalli greenfield national highway project, scores of aggrieved farmers from various parts of the district staged a dharna here on Wednesday to press for the cancellation of the project alleging that it involves loss of over 2,000 acres of farm land in 10 mandals. Expressing their reluctance to give up their farm land for the project, the farmers held a demonstration at Dharna Chowk here. They demanded that the existing 100-foot Khammam-Aswaraopet State highway be upgraded into a national highway to stave off irreparable damage to agricultural productivity. Farmers from several villages in Konijerla, Wyra, Chintakani, Thallada and some other mandals took part in the dharna under the aegis of the Joint Action Committee comprising farmers, and representatives of various farmers’ organisations. Addressing the dharna, the JAC leaders alleged that the greenfield project involves colossal loss of arable farm land endowed with abundant water sources for irrigation spread across ten mandals in the district. They contended that the project would deal a severe blow to thousands of farmers by way of “snatching away” their livelihood and taking a heavy toll on agricultural productivity. Some of the aggrieved farmers from Chintakani mandal asserted that they had already conveyed their objections to the officials concerned and opposed any move to “forcibly” acquire their land for the project.

More facilities for metro travellers this year, says HMR MD|HYDERABAD|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Multilevel parking complexes, electric vehicles and charging facilities for them at all the important metro stations are some of the new facilities that are being developed by the Hyderabad Metro Rail authorities this year, to make travel more convenient for passengers, said Managing Director N.V.S. Reddy on Wednesday. Addressing HMR staff and officers during new year celebrations on the office premises, Mr. Reddy pointed out that specialised stations would soon come into service once Ameerpet-HiTec City route is thrown open for public.

They can shop for anything from abindito clothing,” he said.

Chandrasekhar Rao. Mr. Reddy acknowledged the unstinted support and hard work of the employees pointing out that the project has bagged 72 awards so far.

‘Water supply augmentation projects to be finished by March’|New Delhi|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Supply of water across the city is likely to improve in time for summer 2019, with Delhi Chief Minister and Delhi Jal Board chairperson Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday setting March as the deadline for four water augmentation projects. On Wednesday, Mr. Kejriwal held a meeting at his residence to discuss the water augmentation projects of the DJB, a statement from the Chief Minister’s Office said. Six locations Among the projects discussed in the meeting was extraction of water from six locations on the Yamuna floodplains between Wazirabad and Okhla. The statement said the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) had identified the six locations that had the potential to provide 383 million litres per day (MLD) of water, but apart from two locations, the others had remained untapped. Mr. Kejriwal said the remaining potential should be tapped before the summer. The other augmentation project involved freshwater pockets identified in Dwarka. The DJB had engaged WAPCOS as a consultant to identify freshwater pockets and though the final report was pending, the consultant had given a preliminary estimate of pockets that can give 22.5 MLD of water. Mr. Kejriwal said this source of water should be developed by March-end, the statement added. After Mr. Kejriwal approved a pilot project for a ammonia treatment plant in east Delhi’s Shakarpur last week, he said the technique should be applied to non-functional ranney wells and borewells. Currently, seven ranney wells and 125 borewells are out of use due to the high level of ammonia in the water. “Now the problem of ammonia in water can be handled with the new technique. The ammonia treatment plants should be put up as soon as possible to restart these non-functional units. This should be completed by March end so that there is no dearth of water in the summers,” he said. Once functional, these wells would add 63 MLD of drinking water. Apart from this, Mr. Kejriwal also directed officials to set up new borewells in north and east Delhi, where the water table is high. “Additional bores can also be done in north and east Delhi areas where water table is high and the problem of ammonia can be done away with putting up the treatment plants. These additional bores will not only make these areas self-sufficient for water, but will also create additional water which can be then supplied to other water scant areas of Delhi,” said the Chief Minister. With these additional borewells, some water from the Sonia Vihar treatment plant in east Delhi can then be diverted to south Delhi, which faces shortage. Apart from officials of the DJB, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, Urban Development Minister Satyendar Jain, DJB vice-chairperson Dinesh Mohaniya, MLAs from east and north Delhi and Chief Secretary Vijay Dev also attended the meeting.|0|

Court convicts husband in dowry harassment case|New Delhi|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|A Delhi court has convicted a man for harassing his wife for dowry. However, it has acquitted him of the charge of abetting her to commit suicide. ‘Parents also liable’ “It is clear that deceased was physically and mentally tortured daily. The deceased was married with the accused at a tender age [without her consent, one of her letter says]. She wanted love from her husband but it seems that her husband was loving her for physical relations only. If she has committed suicide, then not only her husband but her parents are also liable for the same, and even then the parents are contesting the case because they have the custody of children and also they have filed suit for partition of the properties left behind by the deceased. Neither her in-laws nor her parents could understand her feelings which must have been conveyed by her to her parents,” the court observed. “Parents have alleged that deceased used to tell them about harassment and torture and also about demand of dowry. Even if the evidence of deceased’s son, father of the victim, victim’s mother, brother of the victim and her cousin sister is treated as hearsay and also that victim’s son has deposed against the accused under the influence of hisnanaandnani, the letters written [by the victim] from time to time are telling the story of the deceased as to how she was treated by the accused persons and why she committed suicide,” the court stated. “In view of above, from the letters and evidence of witnesses, prosecution has been able to bring the case under Section 498A IPC [Part I] against the accused and has proved the same beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly, accused is held guilty and convicted for the same,” Additional Sessions Judge Virender Kumar Goyal said, while holding accused Madhur Malhotra guilty. However, the judge acquitted him of the charge of driving his wife to commit suicide. “Prosecution has not been able to produce on record any evidence to the extend that the accused was having any mense rea and further he instigated the deceased, in any manner, to commit suicide. Accordingly, prosecution has failed to prove offence under Section 306 IPC against the accused, for which accused is acquitted,” the Judge said. The Kirti Nagar police had registered the case on a complaint by the victim’s father, alleging that the accused had started harassing her daughter for dowry from the day of the marriage. The couple had got married in 1998. Suicide prevention helpline: Sanjivini, Society for Mental Health, Telephone: 011-4076 9002, Monday-Saturday, 10 a.m. - 7.30 p.m.|0|
AAP govt to table fifth finance panel report in House today|New Delhi|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The second part of the Delhi Assembly’s winter session will commence on Thursday with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government expected to table the report of the fifth finance commission and the city unit of the BJP likely to protest on “issues affecting the sanctity of the House”. A government official said that Urban Development Minister Satyendar Jain was likely to table the financial report in the House. Resolution issue ‘Opposition BJP legislators said they plan to raise the issue of a recent resolution, involving an AAP legislator’s demand to strip former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of the Bharat Ratna. Leader of the Opposition, Vijender Gupta, told reporters that BJP MLAs would “strongly protest” the deletion of the demand from the proposal approved by the House. “It is against the sanctity and dignity of the House to tamper with official records. House Member M.S. Sirsa has already submitted a notice to the Secretary, Legislative Assembly, under Rule 245 and Section 7 (2) (c) to remove the Speaker. The Opposition will demand that the notice be taken up for necessary action,” he said. The ruling party has said that the demand of its MLA was an amendment to a resolution, which was not approved by the House. Mr. Gupta further said that the BJP MLAs felt that the Delhi government was “working with a vengeance” against the three local bodies and the Opposition would raise the issue in the House with “all the force at their command”. Sealing committee “An amount of Rs. 1,379.51 crore is payable to the east civic body and Rs. 639.48 crore is payable to the north municipality. The Opposition will also demand that the House should collectively fight against the monitoring committee on sealing for its dictatorial behaviour as a result of which residential, commercial and industrial units are being indiscriminately closed,” Mr. Gupta said. The BJP leader said that the Opposition would also raise the issue of “inordinate delay” in the notification of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016; the alleged failure of the Delhi government to find scientific, permanent and effective solutions to pollution; efforts to “derail” Phase-IV of the Delhi Metro; “inhuman behaviour with girls” in children homes; and the alleged failure of the government in implementing the Clinical Establishment Act, 2016.

AAP to announce Lok Sabha election candidates by Feb 15|New Delhi|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|With the aim of getting voters in Delhi and Haryana out on polling day, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) will be appointing lakhs of workers — one for every 10 households in Haryana and Delhi — for the week leading up to the Lok Sabha election, senior party leader Gopal Rai said on Wednesday. Taking a cue from the BJP’s ‘panna pramukhs’, who are appointed for every 30 to 35 families, the AAP will be looking to appoint 3.62 lakh ‘vijay pramukhs’, or ‘victory in-charges’, in Delhi and and 4.62 lakh in Haryana, Mr. Rai said. To ensure voter turnout These workers will start distributing voter slips in the two States a week ahead of the election and then make sure that the voters get to their polling booths on election day, he said. These in-charges will not be working throughout the campaign like the regular party workers or volunteers, said Mr. Rai. While the AAP national council decided on December 29, 2018, that the party would contest Lok Sabha seats in Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Goa and Chandigarh — a total of 33 seats, Mr. Rai said the candidates would be announced by February 15. He added that this time, unlike the 2014 Lok Sabha election, the AAP would not be contesting seats all over the country and would wait for its State committees for the remaining States to give a report to the political affairs committee. “We have decided that we will not contest where we may end up cutting votes. After receiving the reports from the State committees, the PAC will decide the number of seats. Our goal is to end the authoritarian rule of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah,” Mr. Rai said. Door-to-door campaign Leaving the option open of the AAP joining an alliance, Mr. Rai said: “We are monitoring the fluctuating situation in the country.” As part of its campaign in Haryana, the AAP will start a door-to-door drive by January 10. AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal will be meeting Lok Sabha-wise office-bearers from Saturday, after which the campaign will be initiated. In Delhi, where a door-to-door campaign is under way, Mr. Rai said the second phase of the drive will end by January 9. Like for Haryana, Mr. Kejriwal will be taking Lok Sabha-wise meetings starting January 10 to take feedback from the workers on the first two phases of the campaign and to plan out the third phase, he said. Punjab rallies For Punjab, a meeting to plan the campaign strategy will be held at Mr. Kejriwal’s residence on Thursday, with the AAP MPs and MLAs from the State expected to attend. Mr. Kejriwal will be addressing rallies in Sangrur, Anandpur Sahib and Amritsar on January 20, 28 and February 2 respectively, Mr. Rai said.|0|

Gupta accuses Cong of ‘hatching conspiracy’ against Amit Shah|New Delhi|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Delhi Bharatiya Janata Party on Wednesday attacked the erstwhile Congress government for what it alleged was a “conspiracy” against BJP national president Amit Shah and “propaganda against the BJP” in regard to the Sohrabuddin Sheikh encounter case. The Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Legislative Assembly Vijender Gupta accused the top leadership of the Congress of “directing the CBI to victimise” the then Gujarat Home Minister. “Today, the reality is before the nation. Now, it is quite clear that in the year 2010, the CBI arrested Mr. Shah at the instance of the Congress leadership. Not only this, the CBI stated before the judge that we don’t want to interrogate Mr. Shah but only want to arrest him,” Mr. Gupta said. “The same day, the CBI filed a chargesheet against Mr. Shah and put him in jail, while outside the Congress and its top leadership hatched a conspiracy to defame the then Chief Minister of Gujarat and now Prime Minister Narendra Modi...the court later found that there was no proof against Mr. Shah,” he added. The intention of the Congress, Mr. Gupta alleged, was to hatch a “political conspiracy and misuse the administrative system”. “We express our gratitude to the honourable judiciary. The long conspiracy of the Congress failed...During the last eight years, not only the [BJP] national president but his family also suffered...the Congress can cross any limit for its political gain,” he alleged.|0|

Freedom fighters win 36-year-long battle for pension|New Delhi|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|For most freedom fighters, getting the Swatantrata Sainik Samman Pension (SSSP) is more about the honour than the money. Two freedom fighters, both in their 90s now, had to fight the government for 36 years before finally getting their token of respect. Dev Narayan Mishra and Rajendra Thakur had applied for pension under the SSSP scheme in 1982 and 1981 respectively, but the Centre denied them the pension every step of the way. Having lost all hope, they recently approached the Delhi High Court. Acting on their separate pleas, the High Court had about three years back directed the Centre to grant them their pension along with arrears. But the Centre challenged it on the grounds that the two men did not fulfil the conditions to be granted pension under the scheme. Dismissing the Centre’s appeal, the High Court, in a combined verdict last month, reminded the government not to take a “hyper-technical” approach while granting pension to freedom fighters under the scheme. “In the present case, the respondents [Mr. Mishra and Mr. Thakur] fulfil the conditions as stated in the SSSP scheme for the grant of pension and it is also a settled proposition of law that the court shall not adopt a hyper-technical approach while dealing with the case of freedom fighters,” a Bench of Justice G.S. Sistani and Justice Sangita Dhingra Sehgal said. Noting that the basic objective of the scheme is to honour and benefit the kith and kin of freedom fighters, the Bench noted that “the standard of proof required in such cases is not as required in criminal cases”. “Once on the basis of evidence it is probable that the respondent had suffered imprisonment during freedom struggle, a presumption is required to be drawn in his favour,” the HC stated. The SSSP scheme The SSSP scheme was introduced in 1980 by the Centre for grant of pension to freedom fighters and their families from central revenues to extend the benefit of pension to all freedom fighters as a token of respect. For a person to be eligible for pension under the scheme, he/she should have remained underground for a period of more than six months during the freedom struggle for the reason of being declared a proclaimed offender, or one on whom an award for arrest on his head was announced, or one for whose detention, and order was issued but not served. The freedom fighters Mr. Mishra, (90), participated in the freedom movement and remained underground from August 1942 to 1946. In support of his application for grant of SSSP scheme, Mr. Mishra submitted a certificate of personal knowledge (PKC), issued by one Bhagirath Jha, who was a freedom fighter and had remained under detention from 1942-46. Mr. Thakur (96), also took part in the freedom struggle and remained underground between August 1942 till May 1946. Despite making his application for SSSP scheme in 1981, he was denied the pension. The Centre claimed that the PKC was a secondary evidence and cannot be accepted unless a Non Availability of Records Certificate (NARC), issued by the State government, is duly furnished by the claimant. It argued that in both cases, no NARC was furnished. The HC verdict “A conjoint reading of the PKC issued by Mr. Jha along with GR [Government Record] no. 917/1942 as well as various other letters issued by the Government of Bihar, it is evident that the respondent participated in the freedom struggle,” the HC said, noting that in appreciating the scheme for the benefit of freedom fighters a rationale, and not a technical approach, is required to be adopted. The HC upheld its earlier verdict directing the government to pay the pension to the duo with arrears.|0|
Study throws light on innovative strategies for malaria elimination|NEW DELHI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Universal access to malaria diagnosis and treatment and follow-up of patients with enhanced surveillance can dramatically reduce the number of malaria cases. ‘Live project’ This is according to a ‘live project’ — ‘Comprehensive Case Management Programme (CCMP)’ — carried jointly by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-National Institute of Malaria Research, New Delhi; National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) and Medicines for Malaria Venture, Geneva, in four districts of Odisha. A research paper of this project, ‘Improved Access to Early Diagnosis and Complete Treatment of Malaria in Odisha, India’, has been published and was released here on Wednesday at ICMR. “Already there has been significant progress in bringing down the caseload. The ICMR has been carrying out a research that has been relevant to elimination of various diseases from the country and CCMP is an example of such research. CCMP is a sustainable model for improving access to malaria control tools in hard-to-reach areas, and other states could take a cue from this, and intensify efforts towards malaria elimination,” said Balram Bhargava, Secretary, Department of Health Research and Director General, ICMR. Total cases In 2016, India accounted for 6% of the global malaria burden and 90% of the malaria cases in the World Health Organization (South-East Asia region). India aims to eliminate malaria by 2030. Odisha, has reported the highest malaria burden in the country contributing 45% of the total cases annually. Meanwhile, the project was implemented in four districts of Odisha — Dhenkanal, Angul, Balangir and Kandhamal. In each district, one block was control block where routine malaria tackling measures were undertaken; while another was intervention block. CCMP activities in these intervention blocks included training and supervision, ensuring no stock-outs of malaria tests and drugs, analysing verified surveillance data, stratifying areas based on risk factors, and appointing alternative providers to underserved areas. Universal access The programme provided universal access to malaria diagnosis and treatment, and improved the quality of services and surveillance. “There has been an 85% decline in malaria burden in the intervention blocks, 47% of which can be attributed to CCMP, from the period when universal access to malaria services was reached [pre: 2013-2015] to after [post: 2016-2017],” explained Anup Anvikar, scientist, ICMR-NIMR. National framework “The national framework for malaria elimination has already been launched and the programme is in progress. There is a need to reach out to remote areas in order to control malaria. The Indian government has already distributed four crore long-lasting insecticide nets for malaria control. The country has seen a drastic decline in malaria cases and deaths this year. The ICMR has been complementing the programme by conducting operational research on various vector-borne diseases, and this project is an example of the same,” said Neeraj Dhingra, Additional Director, NVBDCP. Calling CCMP a living laboratory, Madan Mohan Pradhan, Additional District Public Health Officer, VBD, Department of Health and Family Welfare, Odisha, said that CCMP learning experience and several best practices from CCMP have been incorporated into the existing NVBDCP programme. Mass screening “The most notable is the CCMP mass screening and treatment of malaria patients along with simultaneous vector control using insecticidal nets/ indoor residual spray in inaccessible areas. This led to creation of DAMAN [Durgama Anchalare Malaria Nirakaran or Malaria Control in Inaccessible Areas]. Utilisation of malaria services in the intervention areas improved as ASHAs and other service providers had the required commodities and skills to diagnose and treat patients at the village level,” he said.|0|

Sisodia hails ‘historic’ restructuring of State education bodies|New Delhi|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT), and the District Institutes for Education and Training (DIETs) have been restructured in what Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio, termed a “historic” move here on Wednesday. Mr. Sisodia was speaking at a ceremony organised on the occasion of restructuring of both the bodies, which he said had been strengthened. The restructuring of both the bodies is in line with what the government termed was a recognition of the “primacy of building a strong academic and institutional foundation” for a series of reform initiatives in education being introduced by it. The restructuring involves upgrading the structure of SCERT from 509 posts to 1,295 posts, and reinventing pay scales and designations across the organisation at par with the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), according to University Grants Commission (UGC) guidelines. The Delhi government has, according to the statement, “substantially increased” the number of academic faculty positions at SCERT and DIETs from around 240 to over 600 to enable these institutions to “better serve their objectives”. “Delhi is the first place in the world that introduced the concept of estate managers in government schools to ensure that the principal can focus on academics and there is someone to take care of the maintenance of the premises,” Mr. Sisodia said. “Similarly, today we add ‘programme coordinators’ in SCERT and DIETs so that educators can focus on the content of trainings and its deliverance instead of food and logistics in big training programmes,” he added.

DCW rescues 3 minor boys from factory|NEW DELHI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) on Wednesday said that three minor boys were rescued from a factory in Omkar Nagar, where they were allegedly ill-treated. Stating that the boys are “survivors of child labour”, a DCW official said, “After receiving a complaint, the DCW sent a team of counsellors to the factory along with Delhi police officers. All the children come from a very poor financial background. They were made to work for 12 hours daily and paid Rs. 2000. The commission was also informed that the boys were forced to consume alcohol.” “The boys told officials that they wished to study and attend school but due to financial constraints they could not,” the official also said.

Techie death: sister suspects foul play|Noida|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The sister of a 28-year-old engineer, who died after falling from the balcony of his flat on the fifth floor of Amrapali Zodiac society in Sector 120, has lodged a complaint against the seven youths who were partying with the victim on the New Year’s Eve alleging that the death was suspicious. ‘No wine bottle found’ Four glasses of wine were recovered from the spot and close friends of deceased, identified as Vivek Parimal, have said that he could not handle too many drinks.

Tyre killers: trial run to begin in Noida on Friday|Noida|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|A trial run has been planned on Friday at Noida Sector 76-74 crossing, where tyre killers will be installed. The move comes after the Noida Authority identified five locations across the city to instal tyre killers to prevent driving on the wrong side. Tyre killers are metal stripes installed on roads with sharp spikes on one side. For those driving on the right side, it would be a small bump, like a speed breaker on the road. However, for those driving on the wrong side, the spikes can puncture the tyres. Driving on the wrong side is one of the most common traffic offences in the city, which has led to several accidents, officials said. The five locations have been identified after feedback from traffic constables. Apart from the Sector 76-74 intersection, the authority will also instal tyre killers at Sector 77 North-Eye junction, Hoshiarpur U-turn, Sai temple U-turn in Sector 61, and near Sector 75 metro station. “The signage informing people about this tool will be installed on Friday. Driving on the wrong side is a menace in the city and such offenders are often penalised. However, it is rampant and residents as well as the authorities are consistently troubled by these miscreants,” said Noida Authority General Manager Rajeev Tyagi. Pune was one of the first cities to instal tyre killers in India but they were removed soon. The move became controversial after some accidents happened when tyres of vehicles were punctured. However, officials said it may be effective in Noida as several steps taken earlier, including blocking unauthorised cuts and increasing e-challans, did not bring much change in driver behaviour.|0|

25-year-old gets one-month jail for stalking minor girl|Mumbai|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|A 25-year-old man has been sentenced to one-month imprisonment by a court in Thane for stalking a minor girl. District Judge V.Y. Jadhav, in his order passed on Tuesday, also imposed a fine of Rs. 20,000 on the accused, Shivkumar Mourya, after pronouncing him guilty under Section 354D (stalking) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. The accused had earlier served one-month in jail following his arrest in the case. According to the prosecution, the accused and the victim were residents of the same locality. The accused used to frequently stalk the Class X student in 2015 when she would go to school. Once while she was travelling in a bus, he sat next to her and tried to touch her inappropriately, the prosecution told the court. The girl told her mother about the incident. Based on the mother’s complaint, the police lodged an FIR against the accused and arrested him. The accused was in custody for a month before getting bail. The prosecution told the court that though the accused had never threatened the girl, he continuously followed her, causing mental trauma. In view of this, the prosecution demanded a maximum punishment (three years) to him under the relevant sections. The defence counsel submitted that considering the age of the accused and absence of any criminal antecedents, he may be awarded a minimum punishment or a sentence for the period which he had already been in custody. After hearing both the sides, the judge said considering the age of the accused and lack of any criminal antecedents, “in my view, directing him to suffer imprisonment of lesser period like one month along with the fine would suffice the purpose.”|0|
Well played Sir and may you coach more wherever you are: Sachin|Mumbai|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Indian cricket fraternity on Wednesday mourned the demise of Ramakant Achrekar, the celebrated cricket coach. Former India captain Sachin Tendulkar, one of Achrekar’s “discoveries” was among the first to pay tributes to his mentor. “Cricket in heaven will be enriched with the presence of Achrekar sir. Like many of his students, I learnt my ABCD of cricket under sir’s guidance. His contribution to my life cannot be captured in words. He built the foundation that I stand on. Last month, I met sir along with some of his students and spent some time together. We shared a laugh as we remembered the old times,” he said. “Achrekar sir,” he added, “taught us the virtues of playing straight and living straight. Thank you for making us a part of your life and enriching us with your coaching manual. Well played Sir and may you coach more wherever you are.” Former India bowler, Ajit Agarkar, said, “He was a special man. Many of us got to know Mumbai by riding on his scooter all over the city for playing matches. I remember after Mumbai riots in 1992, the city had come to a complete standstill. But a couple of days after it had quietened a bit, he came home at 5.30 a.m. to fetch me and my parents couldn’t believe it. The whole city is burning and he wants a young kid to ride on a bike, they said but Sir told them nothing doing, practice is a must. Former India cricketer Chandrakant Pandit said, “When I was in school, he advised me to change the school and join Shardashram so that he could focus more on me. Must have been 1978, and the parents just didn’t see a point since they were of the firm opinion that “cricket will not give me a job”. Sir came home at 12.30 in the night to convince my parents. My father asked him the same question: “how will he earn money?” Sir put his hand in his pocket and pulled out “a thousand rupees”, handed it over to my father and said “this is his salary for this month”.” For Amol Muzumdar, former Mumbai captain, the news came as a great shock. “Two things that come to mind right away are his defining presence. When he used to walk in to Shivaji Park from the Samarth Vyaym Shala side, he used to be a presence and not just our net but all the nets at the Park would get into business mode. The other is when he would sit on the katta behind the Kamath Memorial net and get us lunch. Mutton paav that he would get for all of us would make our day.” Paras Mhambrey, former India cricketer, said, “I was a late-starter, never played in school, so had it not been for him, someone like me with no cricket background or early grooming, would have never been able to be the cricketer I could be.” Sameer Dighe, former India cricketer, said, “We have lost a father figure. Whatever we have achieved is because of him. I wasn’t in Shardashram but he looked after me so well.” Balwinder Sandhu, a 1983 World Cup-team member and Mumbai Ranji coach, said, “I missed my father’s funeral in 1985, I do not know how I will react at my cricketing father’s funeral. “He saw talent in young players, which is a rare quality, gave us ample opportunities to blossom and most importantly, did not hold on to his trainees. Like young ones of birds fly away from the nest at some point, he allowed talented youngsters groomed by him to develop under other coaches.”   (Inputs from G.

India Gate to the Gateway of India|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|In the early evening of December 20, nine bicyclists made it to the Gateway of India, riding together, from Thane. They had waited there for the group to assemble, wanting to do the last leg of their 1,460 kilometre- journey from Delhi to Mumbai, together. It was a motley group from diverse places and backgrounds. There was Shankar Thakur, a 22-year-old boy from Delhi, who cycle-delivered goods for an e-commerce website. He cycled the whole way on a Neelam, without gears or any of the sophisticated devices that many of the others had, finishing ahead of everyone else. Anita Aug, a professional with an insurance company, cycled slow, often arriving at pitstops at 4 am then taking off again at 9, but never giving up. Dr Mukesh Tripathi, an orthopaedic surgeon, came in from Satna, Madhya Pradesh, while Rambabu Venkata, a banker, came in from Mumbai. Rohit Rajagopalan, the head of a start-up from Delhi, wanted to prove that someone living with diabetes could finish the challenge. Atul Mishra, Dr Vinita Jain, Shishir and Rishabh Jain, were the other finishers. What they all had in common, was the fact that they were super randonneurs.  The aim was to declare “If we could cycle from Delhi to Mumbai, along highways, traffic, and dust, you can cycle to work,” says Dr Chiro Priyo Mitra, a vet, who organised the ride, the third of its kind in three years. The official message: The harmonious co-existence of four-wheelers and two-wheelers on the highway. “We got World Ultra Cycling Association (WUCA) accreditation,” he says. Start line When word was put out in March this year about the event, Chiro got 89 registrations that he screened, to ensure that people were physically and mentally fit enough to take part. “We shortlisted 20, and 18 showed up at the start line, India Gate, in this case,” he says. The ride cost Rs. 40,000 all-inclusive, with a support truck with riders until 11 pm, and two back-up bikes. Every place they went, local cyclists welcomed them, and helped with mechanics, if needed. Chiro recalls the first ride he did two years ago, when a local newspaper in Bhilwara picked up news that a bunch of riders were passing through. The tea stall where they’d stopped for a break welcomed them and refused to take money. Finish point Along the way, while there were no mishaps, people dropped out for various reasons, from fatigue to saddle sores. They rode on the highway, at a compounded elevation of 7,400 metres (recorded on a Garmin), mostly through the desert, with low temperatures and rugged routes, the Aravallis going by their side. “The Delhi to Jaipur leg is the most difficult — it’s dusty, the traffic is terrible and people don’t follow road rules,” says Chiro. Ram Babu had a nasty fall, but decided to continue without suturing the wound, or he would not have been able to ride. A few people chose to ride together some distance, but in the end, it’s all about willpower and the mind, says Chiro.  What is a super randonneur (SR)? A person who cycles these distances in a year: 200 km in 13.5 hours  300 km in 20 hours  400 km in 27 hours  600 km in 40 hours   Route  Delhi– Jaipur Jaipur– Bhilwara Bhilwara– Kherwara (Rajasthan) Kherwara– Vadodara Vadodara– Talasari (Maharashtra) Talasari– Mumbai|0|

ZP mulls giving gifts to midwives for referrals|Thane|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Thane Zilla Parishad is considering giving gift hampers todaaisor midwives to motivate them to refer home delivery cases to health centres and hospitals, a senior official said on Wednesday. Thane ZP Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Vivek Bhimanwar said complications often develop during childbirth cases at rural households, and that their number can be reduced by engaging effectively with midwives. Presently,daaisare paid in cash or kind by villagers for conducting deliveries at homes. “We are planning to give incentives in the form of gift hampers to daais for referring such cases to government facilities,” Mr. Bhimanwar said. Thane might become first such district in Maharashtra if the plan materialises, he said. Citing a case, the CEO underlined the need to discourage the practice of home deliveries. Further, he claimed a considerable reduction in number of deaths caused by water-borne and vector-borne diseases in the rural region of the district. “The number of Malaria positive cases has dropped to 75 in 2018 compared to 1,129 in 2014,” he said. The number of Dengue cases also fell to 36 during the period, he said. “No malaria or dengue deaths are reported in the district in 2018,” he said, adding that there was also not a single outbreak of Cholera, Jaundice, Gastro, Diarrhoea, or dysentery in the rural areas of the district.|0|
Government mulls bonus subsidy for farmers|MUMBAI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Gearing up for elections, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis intends to follow in the footsteps of his Jharkhand counterpart, Raghubar Das, by offering a year-long liquidity at Rs. 5,000 per month to every farmer in the State, which will provide them a liquidity top up of Rs. 60,000 over the whole year. The ongoing Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Shetkari Sanman Yojana (CSMSSY) or the farm loan waiver is under active disbursal and expected to cover close to 40 lakh farmers in the State at Rs. 1.5 lakh per farmer and entails a burden of Rs. 30,000 crore on the State Budget. The fresh plans of depositing Rs. 5,000 directly into the individual accounts of farmers every month would similarly require a further financing of around Rs. 15,000 crore more. It will be up to the farmer to decide on how to spend the bonus subsidy — either for the sowing season that will commence soon, or for personal use. The Additional Chief Secretary of Finance in Maharashtra, U.P.S Madan said, “I have no details of the scheme which is being directly handled by the State Agriculture Department.” He, however, said that the State may require to borrow in order to finance it, considering the expenditure already budgeted for the farm loan waiver, the VII Pay Commission payouts in incremental salaries and pensions for State employees as well as the recently declared drought relief program, which will require Rs. 20,000 crore. The sum may increase as more regions are being declared drought hit. Mr. Madan said, “It is a cause for worry as it would impact our deficit adversely. Even though our borrowings are well under control and we have the liberty of borrowing up to Rs. 60,000 crore more, even while remaining under the prescribed limit of 25% of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP), we would not like to indulge in it. Maharashtra’s total debt to its GSDP that stood at 29% of its GSDP in 2003-2004 is down to 16.4% of its current GSDP, although we are permitted a consolidated debt burden of up to 25% of the GSDP. Instead, we will focus on tightening our belts on expenditure during the rest of the year so funds are available for the new subsidy.” This means expenditure cuts for the rest of the year and budgeted funds for priority spending will have to be diverted to meet the financing of the bonus subsidy. Mr. Madan agreed that a part of the financing may still have to be arranged through borrowings in addition to expenditure rationalization. The State had repaid a high cost debt to the extent of Rs. 11, 000 crore that bore a high coupon rate at an interest of 9.5%, 10% and 10.5%, and was negotiating with other lenders for writing off other such high cost debts, which was met with reluctance from financing institutions keen to continue the loan portfolios till the full tenure of the term loans.|0|
HC rejects plea by aspiring constable who didn’t get job|Mumbai|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Bombay High Court recently refused to entertain a plea filed by a man whose application to become a constable was rejected as he had signed the form in capital letters, which was not allowed as mentioned in the instructions of the selection process. On April 22, 2012, the Union government published an advertisement inviting applications for recruitment of constables in Assam Rifles. The advertisement mentioned the instructions for filling applications, including one pertaining to the signature of candidates, which said, “Signature in capital letters of English shall not be accepted and application will be rejected.” Harish Bisht had applied for the job, but signed the forms in capital letters in two places. The application was cancelled on the basis of this, and Mr. Bisht was informed of this on June 10, 2015, by the Regional Director, Government of India, Staff Selection Commission. A Division Bench of Justices Abhay Oka and Sandeep Shinde, relied upon an affidavit filed by the Regional Director which said the result was declared on October 17, 2012, and the petition was filed on May 17, 2016. On December 9, 2014, Mr. Bisht wrote a letter to the chairman of the Staff Selection Commission, in which he mentioned that he had been disqualified on the ground of signing in capital letters. The court said the letter supported the contention made in the reply that Mr. Bisht was aware of the declaration of the result and thereafter had repeated correspondence with the authorities concerned. It said he waited for an inordinately long time to file the petition, one year after the communication from the Regional Director. The court also said, “Mr. Bisht cannot be permitted to invoke writ jurisdiction and the petition suffers from gross delay… Therefore, interference at such a belated stage cannot be made.” The Bench rejected his plea and said, “after accepting the condition in the advertisement without protest and after participating in the selection process, Mr. Bisht cannot raise a grievance about illegalities in the selection process”.|0|

Woman, daughter kill abusive husband, held|BERHAMPUR|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|A 50-year-old woman allegedly murdered her husband with the help of their daughter in Malkangiri district of Odisha. The woman, Mude Madkami, and her daughter Anjali Madkami, 18, of Balakati village were arrested on Wednesday. According to the police, the duo killed Padia Madkami, a migrant labourer and an alcoholic, to escape his torture and abuse. On December 31, 2018, decomposed remnants of a half-burnt body were found in a bushy forest near Gorahunta under Malkangiri police station limits. Post-mortem and inquiry revealed that the body was of Padia Madkami and he had been killed on December 7. Investigation suggested that the deceased had a history of torturing his spouse. His first wife and their son had left him for this reason. Second wife According to police sources, Padia Madkami continued to ill-treat his second wife, Ms. Mude, and their daughter, Ms. Anjali. When his torture became unbearable, Ms. Mude and Ms. Anjali decided to kill the deceased. On December 7, the mother and daughter asked Padia to accompany them to the house of Ms. Mude's sister. On the way, the victim got drunk and started abusing and assaulting his wife. Both women then attacked him and hit his head with a stone. The man died on the spot. The duo then collected some dry straw and set his body on fire inside the forest, police sources said.|0|
Agusta case: ‘new claims made with eye on LS polls’|Mumbai|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Shiv Sena on Wednesday charged that the claims of alleged middleman Christian Michel in the AgustaWestland case were an attempt to corner Congress leaders Sonia and Rahul Gandhi ahead of the upcoming Lok Sabha polls. The Sena, an ally of the BJP at the Centre and in Maharashtra, further alleged that the government machinery was being misused to nail political opponents. A Delhi court hearing the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper case had last week imposed restrictions on Mr. Michel meeting his lawyers in the Enforcement Directorate’s (ED) custody. This was after the agency said he was misusing legal access by passing chits to the advocates asking them how to tackle questions on “Mrs. Gandhi”. In its application seeking extension of Mr. Michel’s remand, the ED, which is the probe agency in the case, also claimed that he had spoken during questioning about the “son of an Italian lady” and how he is going to become the next prime minister of the country. The Sena said when Mr. Michel was extradited from Dubai, Assembly poll campaigns were in progress in five States and the “BJP’s tail was on fire”. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi had at some poll rallies spoken about this middleman and claimed there would be explosive revelations and that he would not spare anybody. We now understand what he was hinting at,” the Sena said in an editorial in its mouthpieceSaamana. It is “laughable” that even before the probe against Mr. Michel could begin, Mr. Modi pointed fingers at the Gandhi family and cleared the line of probe, the Uddhav Thackeray-led party said. “The BJP, which was supposed to lose polls in five States, lost despite Mr. Michel’s extradition to India. It can be clearly gauged that ‘Mission Michel’ is aimed at 2019,” the Marathi publication said. Referring to the verdict in the Sohrabuddin Shaikh encounter case, it said BJP chief Amit Shah and others got a clean chit in it as the CBI “pleaded before the court that there was pressure on the agency to name big BJP leaders”. Their names would have stayed in the list of the accused had the Congress been in power and the Congress today is making similar allegations, it said. “The government machinery is under the feet of two-four people and is being used wrongly to nail political opponents,”the Sena said. It said there have been allegations of kickbacks received in the AgustaWestland deal and the culprits, no matter how “big” they are, should not be spared.  ‘Won’t forget Rafale’ But, just because Mr. Michel has taken the name of Sonia Gandhi and other Congress leaders, people will not forget the Rafale jet scam, the party said. “Like Sonia Gandhi and others have been named here (in AgustaWestland case), the former French president has named Anil Ambani (group) and this (Rafale) scam is worth some thousands of crores,” the Sena said. “This is an attempt to corner Sonia Gandhi and his son before 2019 (polls) and after Quattrocchi (late Italian businessman who was a key figure in the Bofors scandal), Michelpuran(legend) will begin in the country now,” the editorial said. Issues like inflation, unemployment, demonetisation, farmer suicides and Ram temple will take the back seat now and elections will be fought on Mr. Michel’s name, it said.|0|

BEST to extend its 677 MW purchase agreement with Tata|Mumbai|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Brihanamumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) undertaking will extend its Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for 677 MW of electricity with Tata Power for the next five years. After due diligence for ensuring reliability of supply and cost competitiveness for BEST consumers, the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC), in its order dated January 2, approved the extension from April 1 to March 31, 2024. The Commission’s order came after BESTinter aliasubmitted that the cheapest option before it is the extension of its present PPA with the Trombay thermal power station and hydro plants of Tata Power. BEST and Tata Power have agreed for an extension of PPA with the existing terms and conditions. “Tata Power is committed to supplying the most reliable and competitive power meeting the needs of BEST consumers, as always,” Praveer Sinha, CEO and managing director, Tata Power said. The process of power tie-up was undertaken by BEST in 2017-18 for its Discom consumers for a period of five years starting April 1, 2019. The existing tie-up of 677 MW between BEST and Tata Power is scheduled to expire on March 31.  ‘Cheaper power’ A Tata Power spokesperson said in a statement that this will ensure cheaper power to Mumbai consumers with the added advantage of hydro peaking power at rates which are cheapest in the country. “This will also ensure continuity of reliable power supply from embedded Tata Power thermal and hydro generating stations in view of the transmission constraints,” it read.|0|

Flurry of political events in Odisha ahead of polls|BHUBANESWAR|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|With Lok Sabha and Assembly elections a few months away, the political situation in Odisha is hotting up with Prime Minister Narerndra Modi’s back-to-back visits to the State to inaugurate projects and address BJP rallies. Chief Minister and BJD president Naveen Patnaik had raised a series of issues and demanded financial autonomy for Odisha two days after Mr. Modi visited Bhubaneswar on December 24 to inaugurate projects and address a party rally.  Funds for SHGs Mr. Patnaik is not taking any chances this time. When Mr. Modi will dedicate Indian Oil Corporation Limited’s Balasore-Haldia-Durgapur section of Paradip-Haldia-Durgapur LPG pipeline project on January 5 at Baripada, the Chief Minister will address a State-level meeting of the women self-help groups in Puri that day. At the function, Mr. Patnaik will launch distribution of Rs. 15,000 each to the newly formed SHGs in the State.  A senior BJD leader told journalists on Wednesday that Mr. Modi’s frequent visits to Odisha will not have any impact on the State’s political scene. Further, Mr. Modi is scheduled to visit western Odisha town of Balangir on January 16, his third visit to the State in less than a month. The Prime Minister will address the BJP workers and public at a mega rally in the town. The BJD has not announced any programme to counter the saffron party’s Balangir rally so far.|0|
Unacceptable, but so very acceptable|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|If I was a builder who built a sub-standard building that collapsed and killed a few people, or if I was an engineer who inspected and certified such a building as safe, I would be arrested. If I was not very rich, I would probably do some jail time too. I think it is also safe to assume that the State would chip in and offer compensation for the deaths. It does so in cases of accidents, fires, or bridges falling. Funny, then, that a city should simply shake off responsibility when its own municipality is directly responsible for the safety and maintenance of the space. The failure to maintain roads can, and does lead to deaths. But somehow, these deaths do not lead to an outcry, or calls for justice and affixing of culpability, the way a building or bridge collapse death would. The Hindureported recently that, between 2013 and 2017, close to 15,000 Indians had died in accidents caused by potholes. Other reports suggest that the government has admitted to over 9,300 deaths and 25,000 people being injured because of potholes over the last three years. Our Supreme Court has described this situation as “unacceptable”. Mumbai, with its nearly five-month monsoon spell, is especially vulnerable to pothole-related damage. In July last year, a young motorcyclist was killed when his bike fell after hitting a pothole. Just days before, two other pothole-related incidents were reported, one involved a pedestrian and another a mother-of-two who was riding pillion on a bike. Recently, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) flatly refused to pay compensation to victims of road accidents, even if these deaths were caused by potholes. A corporator had demanded compensation, in response to which, the BMC said that the roads were the responsibility of the contractors. Getting off scot-free In November, a woman and a six-month-old baby were reported killed when the bike they were riding pillion on skidded on a potholed road in Dadar. The family of four on the bike was thrown off and crushed by an oncoming water tanker. Oddly enough, the police thought it fit to arrest the tanker driver, but not to take any action against those who are responsible for filling potholes on the roads.The BMC has not responded well to criticism of its handling of the pothole situation. When radio jockey Malishka spoofed the ‘Sonu’ song, calling it the ‘Pothole Mix’, changing the lyrics to describe the mess the city is reduced to during the rainy season — potholes, water-logging, traffic and stalling of trains — the Shiv Sena and its corporators responded with outrage, suggesting that she be sued for ‘defaming’ the municipal body. Eventually, the BMC did send a notice to the RJ’s mother, for ‘dengue breeding’ at home.Perhaps, the corporators need to take some lessons from Mumbaikar Dadarao Bilhore. In 2015, his teenage son died in a pothole-related accident. By June 2018, the grieving father had managed to fill up 556 potholes. He did express the hope that the BMC and MMRDA would look at people and be inspired to do a better job. Bilhore has shown that it can be done quickly and efficiently. It is, nevertheless, a great tragedy that heartbroken citizens should have to do a job for which taxpayers are already paying municipalities and their contractors. Perhaps, the courts need to do more than say “unacceptable”. The author is a writer of essays, stories, poems and scripts for stage and screen  The failure to maintain roads can, and does lead to deaths  Ditch the ditch In Bengaluru, a social venture by a group of citizens called ‘Pothole Raja’ has fixed more than 4,500 potholes in the city.|0|

Govt. agrees to increase stipend of resident docs|Mumbai|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The new year brought relief to the resident doctors in the State after the government assured a Rs. 5,000 hike in their stipend. A government resolution (GR) mandating leave for maternity and tuberculosis is also under way. “The stipend hike was accepted long ago but we had nothing on paper. The circular is finally coming this week. The stipend will be paid from the back date of August 2018,” Dr. Lokeshkumar Chirwatkar, president, Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors, said. The first, second, and third-year resident doctors currently get Rs. 52,000, Rs. 53,000, and Rs. 54,000 as monthly stipend respectively. The last stipend increase was implemented in July 2015 after the resident doctors went on a strike. According to Dr. Chirwatkar, it was during the same time that the government had also agreed to make the resident doctors eligible for maternity and tuberculosis leave. The doctors who work in nearly 12-hour shifts are exposed to infectious patients. “These leaves are essential. The GR to this effect is now in the process. It may take about two months to be issued,” Dr. Chirwatkar said. A fund of Rs. 100 crore was released by the medical education ministry on December 31 to pay the stipend of resident doctors from five government medical colleges. The doctors from Nagpur, Akola, Aurangabad, Ambejogai, and Latur have not received stipend since October. “The authorities have finally released the money which will be utilised for the stipend payment,” Dr. Chirwatkar said. Dr. Pravin Shingare, director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research, confirmed the development. “The resident doctors will get the pending stipend in their accounts on Thursday.”|0|

Woman found dead near railway yard in Kalyan|Mumbai|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The body of a woman was found in the forest near the Central Railway yard in Kalyan on Wednesday morning. “The body was hanging from a tree when our team reached the spot. We did not find anything on the body which could help us identify it,” Shahurao Salve, senior police inspector, Kolsewadi police station, said. According to the police, the body seems to be of a woman in between mid-thirties and early forties, and the level of decomposition indicates that she had been dead for at least two days. “We found some marks on the body but at this stage it is impossible to ascertain whether they are indications of an assault or the body was damaged by animals. We have sent the body to JJ Hospital in Byculla for post-mortem,” an officer at Kolsewadi police station said. The officer said neither a suicide nor murder has been ruled out at this stage. “The spot is secluded and there are no residential areas nearby. As it is a forest, there are no closed circuit television cameras either. Whether it was a murder or suicide, the spot seems to have been chosen carefully,” the officer said. The police are conducting inquiries in Kalyan to find out whether any woman corresponding to the deceased’s description had gone missing in the last few days. Information is being sought from police stations in the Thane commissionerate for any missing person’s complaint. The police are also circulating the description of the body on WhatsApp. Mr. Salve said an accidental death report has been registered, and the further course of action will be decided after the autopsy report is out.|0|
Robosumo, night drone racing is no science fiction|Mumbai|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Technovanza 2018, the festival of Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI), Matunga, with its theme ‘Beginning Of Beyond,’culminated on December 30. Hosting the ISRO exhibition for the first time, Technovanza managed to add a new chapter to its legacy. Over 80,000 visitors attended the three-day festival. The first day saw contestants from across India participate in events that have been in the repertoire since its inception. A flagship event, ‘Fast n Furious’, the IC engine battle captivated crowds as the cars raced to be the fastest one. In ‘Robosumo’ and ‘Robosoccer’ robots grappled at one another for victory. But the highlight of the day was the inauguration of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) exhibition by its former chairman, Dr. A.S. Kiran Kumar. This was followed by a guest lecture in which he talked about the achievements of the ISRO scientists, and the hardships they had to face along the way. The 12-year-old innovator Haaziq Kazi and 13-year-old entrepreneur Tilak Mehta also gave lectures. They encouraged the crowds to pursue their goals irrespective of their age or social standing. The day ended with the exhilarating display of ‘Night Drone Racing’ as the nano-drones flew across obstacles with ease. The second day saw school children participate in the ‘Just a Minute’ contest, in which they had to talk about an impromptu topic assigned to them. Young students also prepared fascinating projects for the ‘Junior X-Con’, in which they were provided eco-friendly solutions to various environmental issues. The VJTI Robotics Challenge 6.0 on the theme ‘Operation Shakti’, inspired by the Pokhran mission, received great appreciation for its subject as well as its gameplay. The much-awaited ‘Robowars’ also kicked off with a new category of 30 kg machines being introduced along with the 60 kg tier. A panel discussion on the topic ‘Data and Democracy’ was conducted by 18th Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Arun Prakash and Vice President, Chief Cyber Security and Business Continuity Officer at Capgemini in India, Mahesh Guru. The final day was marked by the words of Dr. Rajendra Singh, well-known water-conservationist and environmentalist, who spoke on the growing importance of water for our agrarian country.|0|

WR gets in-house blood bank facility|Mumbai|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Western Railway (WR) has opened its first in-house blood bank facility for railway beneficiaries in Maharashtra and Gujarat at Jagjivan Ram Hospital (JRH), Mumbai Central. Costing Rs. 2.5 crore, this is the first such facility made available in any railway hospital on Western and Central Railways. According to a statement issued by Ravinder Bhakar, chief public relations officer of WR, at any given time, the blood bank can store 2,000 blood units. It also has a facility of platelet donation, which is very useful for cancer and dengue patients in need of platelets. JRH is a zonal hospital of Western Railway, and has superspecialty departments like cardiovascular surgery, which require blood supply. It also gets many patients of dengue, who require platelets. About 80% of indoor admissions at the hospital are from outside Mumbai, making it difficult to arrange blood for them. “JRH has developed an in-house facility [which will help arrange] blood for critically ill patients. Hence, this facility will be very helpful for patients during critical hours. JRH got a licence to operate a blood bank for whole blood and its components, including apheresis, on December 31, 2018,” Mr. Bhakar said. A.K. Gupta, general manager of Western Railway, visited to the newly established facility on Tuesday, and was briefed by Dr. Yoganand Patil, senior DMO (pathology) and blood bank in-charge of JRH. Dr. Hemant Kumar, principal chief medical director of WR, Dr. Hafizunnisa, medical director of JRH, and other senior doctors were also present on the occasion.|0|
Woman gets pension after 11-year wait|Mumbai|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Two years after she moved the Bombay High Court and 11 years after her husband’s death, an 80-year-old woman will receive arrears of her family pension with 7% interest per annum, and an additional Rs. 25,000 from the State government. A Division Bench of Justices Abhay Oka and Sandeep Shinde was hearing a petition filed by Rakhmabai Nehere on April 22, 2016, which said that she has been denied family pension since 2007 after her husband’s demise. Her husband worked as a talathi with the State government and was paid Rs. 2,882 per month. The man married a second woman in 1950. He superannuated in 1978, and in 1996 applied to enter the names of both women in the service record as eligible for family pension. When his second wife died on April 2, 2002, the husband informed the treasury office about it. He died on May 16, 2007. In an affidavit filed in court, a senior accounts officer said, the tehsildar, Khed, who is the sanctioning authority for the pension made an endorsement on April 29, 2014, to scrutinise Ms. Nehere’s claim and to furnish necessary family pension papers. The accountant general received the document on May 22, 2018, and he authorised that the family pension payment be made on May 29, 2018. Terming it a “shocking state of affairs”, the court said, “When Ms. Nehere’s husband died, she was around 70 years old. For a period of more than 11 years, she has been denied family pension to which she was legitimately entitled. The affidavit discloses that there were procedural delays and scrutiny of her claim took four years.” The court said, “Even after the order was made by the accountant general, she has been deprived of the pension. Therefore, this is a fit case where the State should be saddled with costs quantified at Rs. 25,000.” The court directed that Ms. Nehere be paid 7% interest per annum on the pension and said, “If the entire arrears and regular pension are not released within a reasonable time fixed by the court, the State will have to be directed to pay interest on the said amount.”|0|

New committee to oversee policy to makes roads safer|Mumbai|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|A new five-member committee will oversee Maharashtra’s efforts to reduce fatalities resulting from road accidents. As per a 2017 order of the Supreme Court, the State this week also appointed nine senior staff of the Transport Department to assist the committee, which will be headed by senior officials of the State Transport Commissioner Office. The panel has been tasked with overseeing the implementation of not only the State’s Road Safety Policy, but other road development works, including finer aspects related to the speed of vehicles, width of roads, and designs of the highways, officials said. “Five of the new members and staffers are from the engineering cadre and would be paid a hefty remuneration upwards of Rs. 40,000,” a senior official of the State Home Department said. The committee will monitor implementation of the Road Safety Policy to ensure road fatalities in the State come down to 25% of the current 13,000 deaths reported annually. The policy is part of the State’s assurances given under the Brasilia Declaration on Road Safety of the World Health Organisation (WHO). Under the policy, the State will establish a data driven system for collection and analysis of road traffic crashes. The system will also include enforcement components such as e-challans and a penalty points system tied to insurance and validity of driving licence. Senior officials said the committee is also tasked with collection and compilation of data pertaining to fatal accidents. According to the Road Accidents in India, 2017, report prepared by the Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, four cities from Maharashtra — Mumbai, Pune, Nashik and Nagpur — feature in the top 50. In Mumbai, 3,160 accidents occurred in 2017, of which 467 were fatal and 2,603 caused injuries. As many as 490 people died in these accidents while 3,287 others were injured. Of the 1,508 accidents that occurred in Pune, 360 were fatal and 966 caused injuries.|0|
Bengal to foot full amount of crop insurance for farmers|Bolpur (W.B.)|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said on Wednesday that her government won’t allow the BJP-led Centre to tag its name with crop insurance for farmers in the State by bearing only 20% of the cost. The State would henceforth pay the entire amount, she said while addressing an administrative meeting in West Bengal’s Birbhum district. Ms. Banerjee said as of now 49% of farmers in West Bengal are covered under crop insurance and the rest will be brought under its purview soon. ‘Emotive issue’ “We won’t allow the Centre to do politics with an emotive issue like crop insurance by tagging their name with the project when it is sharing only 20% of the premium amount. The State presently foots 80% of the crop insurance amount and we will pay the entire amount in future,” she said. “West Bengal pays the major portion of the premium and the Centre uses its name. This cannot go on, we will pay the entire amount henceforth,” the Chief Minister said. She reiterated her last week’s announcement of paying Rs. 2 lakh under ‘Krishi Krishak Bandhu’ scheme to the next of kin of a farmer, aged between 18-60 years, in case of his death. “We have 72 lakh farmer families in the State — the highest in India as West Bengal has smaller land holdings. We are devising a mechanism by which a farmer’s family will get the money 15 days after his death,” the Chief Minister said. Financial assistance Ms. Banerjee further said a farmer will get Rs. 5,000 as financial assistance for each acre of his land in a year for growing a single crop. Under the scheme, farmers will get Rs. 2,500 twice a year for growing a single crop per acre. “We have already waived agricultural tax and abolished mutation system for farmers,” she said, adding that these measures will lead to the State incurring cost of thousands of crores of rupees but “this is important as it concerns the well-being of our farmers, the backbone of our State”.|0|

Cong. waits for Rahul to fix city candidates|Mumbai|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Infighting within the Congress over the candidature in four out of six Mumbai seats is only likely to be settled in front of party president Rahul Gandhi. The party was to discuss the issue on January 1 in a meeting, which has now been postponed for a date yet to be decided. According to senior party leaders the issue will be solved only in front of the party’s top leadership. Out of the six Lok Sabha seats in Mumbai, the party will be contesting five as the Mumbai North-East seat, presently held by the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Kirit Somaiya, will be fought by the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). Among the seats to be contested by the Congress, South Mumbai, presently held by Shiv Sena’s Arvind Sawant, seems to have no other candidate other than former MP and Union minister Milind Deora. The rest four are far from being settled. Congress leader Priya Dutt is unwilling to contest from Mumbai North-Central, which was won by BJP’s Poonam Mahajan in 2014, according to a party source. After the death of former MP and Union Minister Gurudas Kamat, Congress has no pre-decided candidate for the Mumbai North-West seat. Mumbai Congress president Sanjay Nirupam, former Congress MLA Kripashankar Singh are said to be interested in contesting from the seat which was won by Sena’s Gajanan Kirtikar in 2014. Mumbai South-Central, presently held by Sena’s Rahul Shewale, too has no definite candidate. Varsha Gaikwad, daughter of former MP Eknath Gaikwad and present MLA from Dharavi along with former Mumbai University Vice Chancellor Dr. Bhalchandra Munagekar are said to be in the race. Ironically, the party hasn’t found a face to contest from North Mumbai, which was won by BJP’s Gopal Shetty in 2014 in a landslide victory. “We have an increasing number of people ready to contest the election, which is natural and encouraging for us. But any decision on candidates for Parliamentary polls will have to be taken in Delhi,” said a Congress leader from outside Maharashtra, who is involved in these discussions directly. He said that outside Mumbai, in Latur, the party has received 51 applications seeking candidature. When contacted, the party’s Mumbai president Sanjay Nirupam said that the decision on candidates will be taken by the party at the right time and in the appropriate forum.|0|
Maharashtra sees record number of new voters|Mumbai|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Maharashtra has got the election fever with record 36 lakh plus new voters registering their names for inclusion in the electoral rolls since November 1, 2018, when the summary revision of electoral rolls commenced. The process is expected to end on January 4, by which time this figure may go up. In 2018, only 15,53,883 new voters registered themselves. However, the record number of 56,89,104 new enrolments were done just before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. Confirming the data, an official at the State Secretariat toldThe Hindu, “This (36 lakh enrolments) is not unusual since we are entering an election year. It is also true that political awareness seems to be on an upswing.” Changing trend He said while after every five years, the election year is preceded by the maximum number of voter enrolments, this trend is changing. “For instance in 2017, when there were elections slated for local bodies like the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, we had registered 36,98,021 new voters,” he said. Apparently the new generation of emerging voters has become more aware and inclined towards exercising their franchise, he said. The 56 lakh plus new voter registrations in 2014 was followed by only 13,32,574 new enrolments in 2015 and 18,92,351 in 2016. The year 2017 witnessed a fresh surge of 36,98,021 new voters which was followed in 2018 by only 15,53,883 new enrolments. The official said, “On an average in Maharashtra, around 20 lakh youths become eligible for voting every year. Of them, a good majority fail to register unless it is a significant election year. This build-up over four years then results in the sudden surge of new registrations in the election year.” The electoral department bases its assessment on the fact that annually there are up to 18 lakh students who appear for SSC, CBSE, and the HSC examinations. If the number of possible dropouts or those who may have entered vocational education after completing either SSC or HSC is added, the figure would range around 20 lakh. “Sadly, we do not have the electoral data prior to 2012, all records of which were destroyed in the fire that gutted the fifth-floor office of the State Election Commission,” he said. The 8.44 crore voters (4.43 crore men and 4.01 crore women) in Maharashtra as on November 1, 2018, has swelled up by 0.36 crore (36 lakh voters so far) in the ongoing exercise of the summary revision of electoral rolls. Mumbai has witnessed over two lakh new voter registrations. Projected population A senior secretariat official said, “The projected population of Maharashtra stands at 12.6 crore (after factoring in the annual average increase since the last census of 2011). We have already noted that over 36 lakh new voter applications are being processed. A majority of them are those who have turned 18 years.” As on November 1, 2018, more than the rural hinterlands, Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai, Nashik, and Aurangabad had seen the bulk of the new registrations. Mumbai (city segment) had 13,49,692 registered male voters, 11,09,410 female voters, and 106 third gender voters. Similarly, Mumbai (suburban segment) had 37,25,323 male voters, 30,92,946 female voters, and 456 voters belonging to the third gender. The total number of voters in the two segments of Mumbai pegged at 24,59,208 voters (city segment) and 68,18,725 voters (suburban region) with 92,77,933 voters, has now increased by two lakh. The high-density voter bases in Maharashtra also include Pune with 71,89,265 voters, Nashik with 42,60,393, Jalgaon with 32,93,157, Amaravati with 23,34,854 voters, Nagpurwith 38,73,959, Yavatmal with 20,38,514, Nanded with 24,06,859 voters, Aurangabad with 26,49,641, Ahmednagar with 33,18,555, Solapur with 32,26,683, Satara with 23,87,877, Kolhapur with 29,65,314, Raigad with 21,61,614, and Sangli with 22,33,831 voters.|0|
Punjab Cabinet nod for smartphones to youth|CHANDIGARH|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Punjab Cabinet on Wednesday approved modalities for the distribution of smartphones to the youth, with the graduating students of government schools, colleges and technical institutions to be covered in the first phase of the scheme. The decision, taken at a meeting held under the chairmanship of Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, is a bid to fulfil the Congress party’s promise made during the 2017 State Assembly election campaign. “The students would be required to submit self-certification stating that they do not already possess a smartphone. The scheme, which will give an impetus to the State government’s digital empowerment agenda, will provide for distribution of mobile phones with various smart features. In addition, one-time bundled 12 GB data and 600 local minutes talk time (voice) with one-year validity would also be provided under the scheme,” said an official statement. The State government had announced ‘Mobile Phone to the Youth’ in its budget for financial year 2017-18 with the objective of providing digital access to youth. The Cabinet also approved one-time settlement of non-compoundable violations in the case of unauthorised constructions that have come up in the State up to June 30, 2018. The Cabinet also gave its nod for the new online transfer policy of the School Education Department, thus ensuring equal opportunity for all employees using online mode for seeking transfers.|0|
Netflix pulls satire episode in Saudi|Washington|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Netflix has removed an episode of a satirical comedy show from its service in Saudi Arabia over its criticism of the kingdom, following a legal request by officials in Riyadh. The move was widely denounced by rights groups, including Amnesty International, which said it risks facilitating a crackdown on freedom of expression in Saudi Arabia. In the episode of ‘Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj’, the American-born Muslim lashed out at the kingdom after the October killing ofThe Washington Postcolumnist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. He specifically criticised Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and was also critical of the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen. “We strongly support artistic freedom worldwide and removed this episode only in Saudi Arabia after we had received a valid legal request — and to comply with local law,” a Netflix spokeswoman said in a statement on Tuesday. Cybercrime law The streaming giant added that it had received a takedown request citing an article of the kingdom’s cybercrime law as the reason. Article 6 of the law states that “production, preparation, transmission, or storage of material impinging on public order, religious values, public morals, and privacy, through the information network or computers” is a crime punishable by up to five years in prison and a fine not exceeding 3 million Saudi riyals ($8, 00,000). The episode can still be seen in other parts of the world — and in Saudi Arabia on YouTube. “Saudi Arabia’s censorship of Netflix... is further proof of a relentless crackdown on freedom of expression in the kingdom,” said Samah Hadid, Amnesty’s Middle East campaigns director. The Saudi Information Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.|0|

In election year, CM begins interactions with beneficiaries|Mumbai|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Taking a cue from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who routinely interacts with beneficiaries of government schemes, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has decided to hold similar interactions in this election year. The exercise will take place twice in a month. Mr. Fadnavis on Wednesday held the first-ever live interaction with the beneficiaries of different housing schemes of the State and central government named as Loksamwad. Earlier, Mr. Fadnavis used to hold a program called‘Me Mukhyamantri boltoy’in the studio set up by Directorate General of Information and Public Relations (DGIPR) within Mantralaya. Under this programme, the CM used to speak over a topic such as farm loan waiver, or digital governance in front of an audience called from different parts of the State. The audience was allowed to ask questions. The programme had come under scanner of the opposition over expenditure for its production. The program that lasted for over six months has been stopped since November 2017. Interacting with the beneficiaries, Mr. Fadnavis said that the State government is committed to ensure that not a single needy family from Scheduled Caste and Tribe remain without house by next year. “Maharashtra is planning for the construction of around 12 lakh houses under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, out of which six lakh have been built,” said Mr. Fadnavis, in a reply to one of the questions. Loksamwad will now be held twice a month on different topics and schemes announced by the State government. On Wednesday, Mr. Fadnavis held Loksamvad over PMAY, Ramai Housing, Shabri Residence, Deendayal Upadhyaya land purchase scheme all over the State. He also held talks with direct beneficiaries of the houses constructed under various schemes in various other districts, who were present in the District Collector’s offices.|0|
China building ‘advanced’ warships for Pak.: report|Beijing|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|China is building the first of four “most advanced” naval warships for Pakistan as part of a major bilateral arms deal to ensure among other things “balance of power” in the strategic Indian Ocean, the state media reported. Equipped with modern detection and weapon systems, it will be capable of anti-ship, anti-submarine and air-defence operations,China Dailyquoted state-owned defence contractor China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC) as saying. The under-construction ship is a version of the Chinese Navy’s most advanced guided missile frigate, it said. CSSC did not specify the ship’s type but said it is being constructed at its Hudong-Zhonghua shipyard in Shanghai. China, an “all-weather ally” of Islamabad, is the largest supplier of weapon system to Pakistan. Both countries also jointly manufacturing the JF-Thunder, a single engine multi-role combat aircraft. The ship’s class is reported to be Type 054AP, which means it is based on the Type 054A of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Navy, the report quoted the Pakistani Navy as saying. The Pakistani Navy previously said four such ships had been ordered, according to the report. ‘Balance of power’ Once constructed, the warship “will be one of the largest and technologically advanced platforms of the Pakistani Navy and strengthen the country’s capability to respond to future challenges, maintain peace and stability and the balance of power in the Indian Ocean region,” the report said. It will also support the Pakistan Navy’s initiative of securing sea lanes for international shipping by patrolling distant waters, the daily quoted CSSC as saying. The report said Type 054A is the best frigate in service with the PLA Navy. Military sources said the ship has a fully loaded displacement of about 4,000 metric tonnes and is equipped with advanced radars and missiles. About 30 Type 054As are in service with the PLA Navy. An insider in China’s shipbuilding sector with knowledge of the Type 054AP programme told theDailythat the ship is the largest and most powerful combat vessel China has ever exported. “Based on pictures circulating on the Internet, the ship will have vertical launch cells that can fire Chinese HQ-16 air-defence missiles and other kinds of missiles,” he said.|0|

Fresh snowfall in Kashmir Valley|Srinagar|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|A fresh spell of snowfall on Wednesday ended the chilly wave, triggered by the sub-zero temperature in the past two weeks, in Kashmir Valley. However, the snowfall forced the closure of the Srinagar-Jammu National Highway and cut off many areas from the towns in north and south Kashmir. “Snowfall left many stretches on the Srinagar-Jammu highway slippery and was not fit for vehicular traffic,” said an official of the traffic department. The fresh spell saw heavy snowfall in upper reaches of the Pir Panjal mountain range and moderate snowfall in tourist hotspots like Gulmarg and Pahalgam. Mild rainfall Srinagar city also witnessed a mild rainfall. According to the meteorological department, the minimum temperature improved to minus 0.4 degree Celsius compared to around minus 2.8 degree C recorded the previous night. “The day temperature hovered around 6.5 degree Celsius,” said a met official. The department predicted a fresh spell of light snowfall in next two days. “Snowfall may be moderate to heavy but isolated on January 4,” said the official. Meanwhile, on the inputs received from the Indian Meteorological Centre in Srinagar, Divisional Commissioner, Kashmir, Baseer Ahmad Khan issued a weather advisory on Wednesday. This new weather system may lead to disruption of surface and air transportation. “Deputy Commissioners of Kashmir Division, including Leh and Kargil, have been asked to advise people not to venture in avalanche-prone areas during this period,” said Mr. Khan. The Deputy Commissioners were directed to activate their control rooms and ensure that the snow clearance equipment is placed at proper places.|0|
Pawar asks CM to withdraw charges against Marathas|Mumbai|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar has written a letter to Chief Minister (CM) Devendra Fadnavis seeking withdrawal of serious charges slapped on protesters during a Maratha quota agitation in 2018 at Kalamboli-Kamothe area of Navi Mumbai after conducting a proper enquiry. The police had fired in the air after protesters indulged in arson and pelted stones during the stir last July along the Sion-Panvel Highway in Raigad. In Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) president Mayawati too had demanded the newly-formed Congress governments to withdraw cases filed against Scheduled Caste protesters by the previous Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) governments during the Bharat bandh called by SC groups on April 2, 2018, calling them politically motivated. The government in Madhya Pradesh has taken back the cases. Mr, Pawar wrote the letter dated December 29, after he visited the Panvel tehsil. However, he made it public on Wednesday. It stated, “I was given a memorandum during my visit which stated that innocent and well-educated people were booked by police under Section 307 (Attempt to murder) of the IPC and other serious charges.” “It is highly unlikely that doctors, lawyers and women would indulge in violence,” he wrote. Mr. Pawar also attached a list of people who he said were falsely implicated under serious charges. The NCP chief has demanded an enquiry into the charges to ensure that innocent people are not harassed. “I expect you will withdraw cases against innocent persons,” Mr Pawar said to the CM.

Cess to pay for cowsheds in U.P.|LUCKNOW|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|To tackle the menace of stray cattle, the Yogi Adityanath-government in Uttar Pradesh has decided to set up ‘temporary’ shelter homes for cows across the State but the costs will be borne by the public in the form of additional ‘cow welfare cess’ on excise items. In a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, the State government decided to introduce an additional levy of up to 0.5% as ‘gau kalyan cess’ on more than half-a-dozen public sector infrastructure departments, including excise, to fund and maintain the project. The levy imposed on mandi parishads will now be doubled from 1% to 2%, while a cess of 0.5% will be levied on the toll tax collected by the government agencies for travel on State-built roads and highways, and on profits made by the public sector enterprises and construction agencies. Whether the excise items would include alcohol has not yet been clarified. The Opposition in Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday slammed the decision, saying this would burden the people. “It is the responsibility of the government to protect cows, but I wonder why the people are being burdened,” Samajwadi Party spokesman Rajendra Chaudhary said. Bahujan Samaj Party president Mayawati challenged the Centre to impose a similar cess at the national level if the protection of cows can be ensured through such thinking of the BJP and the RSS. The government decision comes amid reports that farmers staged protests against the growing menace of stray cattle, which raid fields and destroy their crops. Also, the Opposition parties have also regularly blamed the BJP government for the role of the animals in the vehicle accidents. In a statement, the government said that it has decided to set up ‘asthayi govansh ashray sthal’ or temporary cow shelters in both rural and urban areas with a capacity to house a minimum of 1,000 cows and cow progeny. These shelters would be made financially ‘self-sustainable’ through sale of milk, dung and compost. If cattle-rearers and farmers leave their animals in public places, on roads or on the private land of other people, a fine will be imposed on them, the government said. In parts of U.P., there has been a tradition to abandon old or dry cows. The government has allotted Rs. 10 crore to each of the 16 municipalities in the State to arrange shelters for destitute cows. “Apart from this, Rs. 1.2 crore has been given to every district for gau shalas,” said the statement last week. Mr. Adityanath had then instructed officials to make ‘immediate arrangements’ for proper care of destitute cows in the State and ensure strict action against land mafia who have encroached upon grazing areas. The CM also instructed officials to make functional the 750 kanji houses (cows shelters) set up at the Zilla Panchayat level, and ensure proper fodder, shed and drinking facilities for the bovines.

8,000 riders penalised on Day One of helmet rule in Pune|Pune|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Citizens’ groups in the city continue to remain fiercely divided over Pune police’s compulsory helmet rule, which has come into force from January 1. While nearly 8,000 two-wheeler riders were penalised for violating the rule on New Year’s Day, several bike riders remained hostile to it despite Pune Police Commissioner K. Venkatesham warning that offenders would be taken to task. With mounting pressure from anti-helmet outfits and politicos, even the police seemed ambivalent about enforcing the rule too rigidly. This has prompted a city-based NGO Parisar, associated with urban safety issues, to send a legal notice to the Director -General of Police, the State Transport Commissioner and the Police Commissioners of the Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad regions for “failing to ensure the strict compliance” of the provisions of the Motor Vehicles (MV) Act, 1988. Sujit Patwardhan of Parisar observed that in July 2003, the Bombay High Court had passed an order directing the implementation of the provisions of Section 129 of the Act, which make the use of protective headgear compulsory for every person driving or riding pillion on a motor cycle of any class or description. In March 2005, the HC had again taken note of the non-compliance of the 2003 order and directed that the provisions of the MV Act be strictly implemented in the entire State from July 1, 2005. “In spite of the said judgment, a large number of two-wheeler drivers continue to flout these mandatory provisions of Section 129 of the MV Act. This legal notice is to put ‘constructive pressure’ on the police to carry out their promised enforcement and not be swayed by the anti-helmet faction,” Mr. Patwardhan toldThe Hindu. A recent survey by the NGO revealed that barely 28% of riders and 1.1% of pillion riders used a helmet. “Pune has the highest number of two-wheelers in the country – a number which is only increasing every year. But so are the fatalities. Other than some token ‘awareness programmes’, no consistent effort has been taken by civic authorities to bring down the number of accident-related deaths. So, we are left with no option but to take legal recourse,” said Ranjit Gadgil, Programme Director, Parisar. Mr. Venkatesham said that the objective behind making helmets compulsory for riders as well as the pillion was to bring about discipline and drastically reduce deaths from two-wheeler accidents. “As opposed to last year, this time on New Year’s Eve there were no fatal accidents owing to our enforcement of the helmet rule,” he claimed, Violators, he added, will undergo counselling sessions.  ‘Misplaced priorities’ However, RTI activist Vivek Velankar, founder of the Sajag Nagrik Manch and part of the anti-helmet faction, asserted that the decision to wear or not wear a helmet ought to be an individual choice. “With traffic crawling on Pune’s congested roads, 80% of citizens never wear helmets. Instead of repairing dysfunctional roads and apprehending traffic offenders, the Pune police is merely trying to enforce a law which usually degenerates into a revenue garnering exercise for the authorities,” Mr. Velankar alleged. He observed that the most vociferous advocates of the helmet rule usually were people who owned four-wheelers and had seldom worn a helmet. Mr. Velankar said the rule only helped increase the market for spurious helmets. “The traffic policeman seldom checks if a rider is wearing an ISI-quality helmet or not. If the helmet is of dubious quality, how can it act as protective headgear,” he observed, adding that in the end, the two-wheeler rider is compelled to buy a helmet for Rs. 800 to avoid a Rs. 500 fine.|0|

Plan to have specific names on Arunachal ST list cleared|New Delhi|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the Home Ministry’s proposal to replace the generic term ‘any Naga tribes’ with the specific names of the tribes that would qualify for recognition as Scheduled Tribes in Arunachal Pradesh. The decision taken ahead of the 2019 general election, on a proposal from the Arunachal Pradesh government, is likely to have a bearing on the peace talks with the National Socialist Council of Nagaland-Isak Muivah (NSCN-IM). The NSCN-IM and other Naga groups have been campaigning for a Greater Nagalim or a contiguous land for the Nagas across Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Myanmar. Proposal cleared in 2018 The decision was taken at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In October last year, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh had cleared the proposal, which was examined and recommended by the Tribal Affairs Ministry and the Registrar-General of India. “As for replacing ‘any Naga tribes’ with the specific names of Tutsa, Wancho, Nocte and Tangsa, it has been cleared by the Tribal Affairs Ministry first. The Cabinet has endorsed it,” said a senior official. Union Law and Justice Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order (Amendment) Bill, 2018, for revision of the list of Scheduled Tribes of Arunachal Pradesh, was cleared, and the names of some communities would be deleted. An official statement said ‘Khampti’ would be replaced with ‘Tai Khamti’ in the list. ‘Abor’ would be deleted and ‘Mishmi-Kaman, Idu and Taraon’ would be included. ‘Monpa, Memba, Sartang, Sajolong’ would be included in lieu of ‘Momba’ in the ST list of Arunachal Pradesh. The Home Ministry will have to move the Bill in Parliament before the winter session concludes on January 8 for the changes to come into effect.|0|
Lessons from Kerala|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Last year, in October at Astana, Kazakhstan, world leaders declared their commitment to ‘Primary Care’. They were reaffirming what their predecessors had done in Alma Ata in 1978. The Alma Ata Declaration, as it was called, had been criticised as wishful thinking without a clear road map on strategies and financing — an allegation that could be levelled against the present declaration too. In 2016, Kerala had, as part of the Aardram mission to transform health care, attempted to re-design its primary care to address the current and future epidemiological situation. Lessons learnt from Kerala’s experience could provide insights into what needs to be done to ensure the objectives of the Astana Declaration do not remain a statement of pious intentions in India. The Astana Declaration would “aim to meet all people’s health needs across the life course through comprehensive preventive, promotive, curative, rehabilitative services and palliative care”. A representative list of primary care services are provided: “including but not limited to vaccination; screenings; prevention, control and management of non-communicable and communicable diseases; care and services that promote, maintain and improve maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health; and mental health and sexual and reproductive health”. The Kerala experience In the revamped primary care, Kerala tried to provide these services and more with mixed results. These services cannot be provided without adequate human resources. It is nearly impossible to provide them with the current Indian norm of one primary care team for a population of 30,000. Kerala tried to reduce the target population to 10,000. Even the reduced target turned out to be too high to be effective. Kerala’s experience suggests that providing comprehensive primary care would require at least one team for 5,000 populations. This would mean a six-fold increase in cost of manpower alone. Since supply of more human resources would generate demand for services, there would be a corresponding increase in the cost of drugs, consumables, equipment and space. So a commitment to provide comprehensive primary care — even in the limited sense in which it is understood in India — would be meaningful only if there is also a commitment to substantially increase the allocation of funds. It is sobering to remember that most successful primary care interventions allocate not more than 2,500 beneficiaries per team. Providing the entire set of services, even if limited to diagnosis and referral, is beyond the capacity of medical and nursing graduates without specialised training. Practitioners in most good primary care systems are specialists, often with postgraduate training. The Post Graduate Course in Family Medicine, which is the nearest India has to such a course, is available in very few institutions. If the services are to be provided by mid-level service providers, as is planned in many States, building their capacity will be even more of a challenge. It would be a long time for this to be built. Kerala has tried to get over this through short courses in specific areas such as management of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and depression. The primary care system will be effective only when the providers assume responsibility for the health of the population assigned to them and the population trusts them for their health needs. Both are linked to capacity, attitude and support from referral networks and the systemic framework. It will not be possible unless the numbers assigned are within manageable proportions. Access to longitudinal data on individuals through dynamic electronic health records and decision support through analysis of data will be helpful in achieving the link. Discussion on primary care in India focusses only on the public sector while more than 60% of care is provided by the private sector. The private sector provides primary care in most countries though it is paid for from the budget or insurance. The private sector can provide good quality primary care if there are systems to finance care and if the private sector is prepared to invest in developing the needed capacities. Devising and operating such a system (more fund management than insurance though it can be linked to insurance) will be a major challenge but a necessary one if good quality primary care is to be available to the entire population. Negotiations to set up such systems in Kerala are only at the initial stage. Achieving Universal Health Coverage — one of the Sustainable Development Goals to which India is committed — is not possible without universal primary health care. The experience of Kerala in transforming primary care reveals the steepness of the path India will have to cover to reach the goals committed to in the Astana Declaration.

Taiwan’s unification with China is inevitable, says Xi|Beijing|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Taiwan’s unification with the mainland is “inevitable”, President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday, warning against any efforts to promote the island’s independence and saying China would not renounce the option of using military force to bring it into the fold. Mr. Xi’s comments provoked a swift rebuke from Taipei, where President Tsai Ing-wen said Taiwan’s people would never willingly give up the kind of democratic freedoms unseen on the mainland. China still sees democratic Taiwan as part of its territory to be reunified, despite the two sides being ruled separately since the end of a civil war in 1949. “China must and will be united... which is an inevitable requirement for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese people in the new era,” Mr. Xi said in a speech commemorating the 40th anniversary of a message sent to Taiwan in 1979, in which Beijing called for unification. ‘One country, 2 systems’ “We make no promise to give up the use of military force and reserve the option of taking all necessary means” against Taiwanese separatist activities and “outside forces” that interfere with reunification, he said. Mr. Xi described unification under a “one country, two systems” approach that would “safeguard the interests and well-being of Taiwanese compatriots”. Taiwan considers itself a sovereign state, with its own currency, political and judicial systems, but has never declared formal independence from the mainland.  Democratic values Relations have been strained since the 2016 election of President Tsai, who has refused to acknowledge Beijing’s stance that the island is part of “one China”. “Democratic values are cherished by the Taiwanese people, it’s their way of life,” Ms. Tsai said in a press conference arranged in response to Mr. Xi’s speech. She accused Beijing of provocations that strained people’s “emotional connection” to the mainland such as “buying off” Taiwan’s few diplomatic allies and increased military drills near the island. Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry released a terser response. “If the Chinese government cannot treat its own people kindly, cannot guarantee human rights and will not let its own people vote... then Taiwanese will look at China’s intent with suspicion,” it said. Though Mr. Xi’s speech takes a strong stance against Taiwanese separatists, it is aimed mostly at domestic audiences, analysts say. “It’s rather empty and doesn’t have any new points except that cross-strait unification would not affect the interests of other countries,” said Fan Shih-ping, political analyst at National Taiwan Normal University, adding that Mr. Xi’s words may also be intended for the U.S.|0|

Deterrence or danger?|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The indigenous nuclear submarine, INS Arihant (picture), is a great achievement for India. The Indian Navy, its engineers and scientists have done us immensely proud. But it might not be inappropriate to ask: Will Arihant make us more secure, and if so, in what way? It has been universally recognised that the sole justification for having nuclear weapons is their deterrence value. If ever a nuclear bomb has to be used, it has destroyed its raison d’être. The initiation of a nuclear attack would mean utter destruction, not just for the two parties involved but also for regions far beyond. The Americans got away with their bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, however controversial it was, because they had a monopoly of nukes at the time. Today, the situation is vastly different and far more dangerous. If nuclear weapons fail to deter the outbreak of war involving use of such weapons, they have disastrously failed in their deterrence mission. A nuclear triad The major nuclear weapon powers, principally the U.S., have developed the myth of a nuclear triad, that consists of land-based, air-based and sea-based nuclear delivery systems. The theory is that if country A initiates a nuclear attack on country B in a first strike, country B must be in a position, even after absorbing the nuclear strike, to retaliate with a massive nuclear attack on the enemy country. This is called second strike capability. In the event that country A manages to destroy the land and air-based nukes of country B, country B will still have its third leg in the shape of sea-based nuclear-tipped missiles, called SLBMs or submarine-launched ballistic missiles, for use against country A because the sea-based missiles, launched from nuclear-powered submarines, would have remained undetected and hence safe from enemy attack. Thus, the rationale for the naval leg of the triad is its survivability. Essentially, the argument in favour of the naval leg is not that it makes the deterrent more credible, but that, as mentioned above, it will survive for retaliation. In the event that an enemy initiates a nuclear strike, it will never be able to destroy all the land and air-based nuclear weapons of the target country. Again, the enemy might attack population centres and not nuclear weapon sites; in that case, all the nukes of the target country would be available for retaliation. In either case, the deterrence capability of the target country would remain intact. If the possession of the naval leg were to deter the enemy, ab initio, from initiating a nuclear launch, it would add to the deterrence value. Survivability by itself does not appear to make deterrence more credible. If the hostilities reach the threshold where a country may consider using nuclear weapons, it would be preceded by a period of conventional warfare. The enemy would also have to reach the conclusion that unless he uses his nuclear weapons, he would suffer a defeat that he simply cannot afford to let happen. A conventional conflict itself will not start before several days of negotiations, including possible mediation by external powers and the UN Security Council. Even a small incident involving India and Pakistan would immediately invite big powers to rush in and mediate pull-back of forces, etc. Whether the external interventions succeed or not in preventing a major war, the target country would have ample time to disperse its land and air-based nuclear assets. The naval leg does not seem indispensable. The case of Pakistan Let us take Pakistan. One does not know if it has a nuclear doctrine, but even if it does not have one, that by itself does not make it an irresponsible nuclear power. Pakistan has rejected the no-first-use policy and has in fact said that it would not rule out using nukes if it felt compelled to do so in a war. It claims to have so-called tactical nuclear weapons which can presumably be used in a battle field. Pakistan, in other words, keeps the option of using nuclear weapons first as a deterrent against a conventional attack by India. India’s stand is clear. Any use of nuclear weapon, tactical or otherwise, will invite massive retaliation by India which would have disastrous consequences for Pakistan. (Will India remain unaffected by radiation, etc? Can we guarantee that the winds will not blow in our direction? The radiation, debris, heat, blast, etc will be carried well beyond the belligerents’ borders.) So, even assuming that we will have the political and moral will to unleash the full force of our nukes, how does acquiring SSBNs or a nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine make our deterrent more credible? Since Pakistan is still a long way away from having the naval leg of the triad, would not our land and air-based nukes be enough of a deterrent? Is it conceivable that after destroying each other’s land and air-based nuclear platforms, either country will have even the need to bring into play its naval leg? And, if and when Pakistan does acquire the third leg, which it is bound to sooner or later, even if it has to ‘eat grass’, will it then make the nuclear equation more stable and make each country’s deterrent more credible? We may not admit it, but we are engaged in a nuclear, and conventional, arms race, exactly the same way the superpowers were during the Cold War era. China is far ahead of India in many respects. It has more warheads and more nuclear-powered submarines. Both India and China have repeatedly declared adherence to the no-first-use doctrine. So where is the justification for acquiring the naval leg of the triad? We have a territorial dispute with China, but both countries have acquired enough experience to manage and contain the conflict. It is reasonably safe to say that there will not be an all-out war involving the use of nuclear weapons between India and China. One of the arguments in the 1960s and 1970s in favour of atom bombs was that they would be cheaper in the long run. That has not happened. The acquisition of expensive conventional platforms as well as the ever expanding nuclear programme has destroyed that argument. India has been in the forefront in campaign for nuclear disarmament. Let us not at least escalate a nuclear arms race in our region. Chinmaya R. Gharekhan, a former Indian Ambassador to the United Nations, was Special Envoy for West Asia in the Manmohan Singh government|0|
Manchester stabbings suspect held under Mental Health Act|London|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The police said the sole suspect in the stabbing of three people in Manchester on New Year’s Eve has been detained under Britain’s Mental Health Act. The attack, which the police are treating as a terrorist incident, took place at the Victoria train station. The station is next to the Manchester Arena, the site of a May 2017 suicide bombing that killed 22 people at a pop concert. The Greater Manchester Police said, in a statement, that the 25-year-old man was assessed by medical staff before the decision was reached. The suspect has not been identified and the police have not explained a possible motive for the attack. Officials said verifying that the suspect acted alone without a support network is a key objective of the investigation, which is being headed by the counterterrorism police. The police searched the suspect’s home in Manchester for evidence. Two of the victims, a man and a woman, are still hospitalised with serious injuries but authorities say they are not life-threatening. A policeman who was stabbed in the shoulder has been released from the hospital.|0|
SC rejects plea seeking FIR against Mulayam|New Delhi|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed a plea challenging the Allahabad High Court verdict rejecting a petition seeking direction to Uttar Pradesh Police to lodge an FIR against former Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav for his alleged order to open fire on ‘kar sewaks’ at Ayodhya in 1990. A Bench, comprising Justices Ashok Bhushan and K.M. Joseph, dismissed the plea on the ground of delay considering the fact that appeal has been filed against the May 3, 2016, order of the High Court. The plea had alleged that on October 30, 1990, several ‘kar sewaks’ were killed in police firing at the temple town when they were taking part in a “peaceful movement” for the construction of a Ram Temple there. The plea was filed by a Lucknow-based man, who had in 2014 approached a trial court for a direction to the police to lodge an FIR against Mr. Yadav, who was the Chief Minister of U.P. in 1990. He had alleged that the Samajwadi Party leader had given a statement in public meetings that he had ordered the police to fire on ‘kar sewaks’ to win the confidence of Muslims. The trial court had dismissed his plea after which he had moved the High Court challenging the order. In his appeal filed in the top court, the petitioner had claimed, “The High Court failed to appreciate that in a huge public gathering, Mulayam Singh Yadav, has confessed/ admitted that he ordered to fire guns on ‘kar sewaks’ and he further admitted in the second public meeting that if he did not order to fire on kar sewaks then the confidence of Muslims would be broken.”|0|
Trump has not risen to mantle of office: Romney|Washington|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Incoming Senator Mitt Romney has written a scathing op-ed targeting U.S. President Donald Trump, saying he “has not risen to the mantle of the office”. The barbed remarks from the 2012 Republican presidential candidate came as he and other lawmakers prepare to take up their seats in the new Congress. ‘Alienated allies’ “With the nation so divided, resentful and angry, presidential leadership in qualities of character is indispensable,” Mr. Romney wrote in the op-ed piece inThe Washington Poston Tuesday. “And it is in this province where the incumbent’s shortfall has been most glaring.” He added that Mr. Trump’s actions had caused “dismay around the world” and alienated traditional allies in Europe. His comments seemed to suggest that Mr. Romney is positioning himself to take over the role of Jeff Flake, a departing Senator who was a vocal critic of Mr. Trump. The U.S. leader responded in a relatively restrained tweet. “Here we go with Mitt Romney, but so fast! Question will be, is he a Flake? I hope not,” he wrote. “Would much prefer that Mitt focus on Border Security and so many other things where he can be helpful. I won big, and he didn’t. He should be happy for all Republicans. Be a TEAM player & WIN.” It is the latest twist in a relationship that has run hot and cold for years. Mr. Romney called presidential candidate Mr. Trump a fraud and a phony in 2016. But last year, he thanked Mr. Trump for his endorsement as Mr. Romney ran for a senate seat from Utah. In the op-ed piece, Mr. Romney said he was initially encouraged when Mr. Trump brought into his Cabinet steady-hand figures like James Mattis as Defense Secretary and John Kelly as Chief of Staff. “But, on balance, his conduct over the past two years, particularly his actions this month, is evidence that the President has not risen to the mantle of the office,” Mr. Romney wrote.|0|

Powering South Asian integration|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|On December 18, the Union Ministry of Power issued a seemingly anodyne memo that set the rules for the flow of electricity across South Asian borders. Evaluated against the turbulent politics around the issue, the new guidelines are a startling departure from India’s previous stance. In an atmosphere of regional intrigue and mistrust, it is a rare and recent example of political pragmatism. It is important not only because it leads South Asian electricity trade in progressive directions but is also a concession to India’s neighbours in an area of political and economic importance. A course correction The revision is a response to two years of intense backroom pressure from neighbours, particularly Bhutan and Nepal, to drop trade barriers put up in 2016. The new guidelines meet most of their demands, that were timed to coincide with the recent visit of Bhutan’s new Prime Minister. India has thus signalled that it is serious about working with neighbours on the issues that should undergird 21st century South Asian regionalism, such as electricity trade. This course correction is a return to a trajectory of incremental, hard-earned progress developed over the decades. Ideas of tying South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries together with cross-border energy flows — that punctuated the early 2000s — began to gain steam with substantial power trade agreements between India and Bhutan (2006) and Bangladesh (2010). These were driven by India’s need for affordable power to fuel quickened growth in a recently liberalised economy. The apotheosis came in 2014 with the signing of the SAARC Framework Agreement for Energy Cooperation and the India-Nepal Power Trade Agreement in quick succession. The new government in New Delhi was keen on regional cooperation, and these agreements imposed few restrictions on trade. Instead, they laid the contours of an institutional structure that would allow private sector participation and facilitate market rationality in electricity commerce. At the Fifth SAARC Energy Ministers’ meeting that year, Power Minister Piyush Goyal said he dreamt of ‘a seamless SAARC power grid within the next few years’ and offshore wind projects ‘set up in Sri Lanka’s coastal borders to power Pakistan or Nepal’. Yet, two years later, the Union Ministry of Power released guidelines that imposed a slew of major restrictions on who could engage in cross-border electricity trade. There was a strong undercurrent of defensiveness in the guidelines of 2016. They seemed to be a reaction to perceptions of increased Chinese investment and influence in the energy sectors of South Asian neighbours. Some irritants The guidelines prevented anyone other than Indian generators in the neighbouring country, or generators owned by that country’s government, from selling power to India. Excluded were scores of privately held companies, particularly in Nepal, that had hoped to trade with India. In restricting access to the vast Indian market, the economic rationale for Nepali hydropower built for export was lost. Bhutan was worried about a clause that required the exporting generation companies to be majority owned by an Indian entity. This created friction in joint ventures between India and Bhutan. Bhutan also fretted about limited access to India’s main electricity spot markets, where it would have been well placed to profit from evening peaks in demand. Bangladesh had sensed an opportunity to partially address its power crisis with imports from Bhutan and Nepal routed through Indian territory but the guidelines complicated this by giving India disproportionate control over such trade. After two years of protests from neighbours, the new guidelines resolve all these issues and restore the governance of electricity trade to a less restrictive tone. Earlier concerns that India was enabling the incursion of foreign influence into neighbouring power sectors seem to have been replaced by an understanding that India’s buyer’s monopoly in the region actually give it ultimate leverage. More broadly, India seems to have acknowledged that the sinews of economic interdependency created by such arrangements have the political benefit of positioning India as a stable development partner rather than one inclined to defensive realpolitik. Tool for a greener grid A liberal trading regime is in India’s national interest. As India transitions to a power grid dominated by renewables, regional trade could prove useful in maintaining grid stability. Major commitments to renewables, which could amount to half of India’s installed power within a decade, have prompted justifiable concerns about stabilising the grid when the sun goes down or in seasons when renewables are less potent. Harnessing a wider pool of generation sources, particularly hydropower from the Himalayas that ramps up instantly as India turns on its lights and appliances after sunset, could be an important instrument in achieving a greener grid. Nepal and Bhutan have long recognised that their prosperity is tied to the sustainable use of vast hydropower reserves. The new guidelines are a tentative first step towards the creation of a true regional market in which generators across the subcontinent compete to deliver low-cost, green energy to consumers. Since this would soften the hard borders of South Asia, it is essentially a political vision. The new guidelines are a significant step in this direction because, for the first time, they allow tripartite trading arrangements, where power generated in a country is routed over the territory of a neighbour to be consumed in a third. This is a crucial move towards the evolution of complex, multi-country market arrangements. Such markets require the construction of regional institutions that absorb the politics and manage the technicalities of electricity trade. At present, this function is managed by the Indian state because of its geographic centrality and the ready availability of institutions that manage its domestic power sector. As volumes increase and experience in regional trade grows, South Asian nations might feel the need to build joint, independent regional institutions that proffer clear and stable rules of the road. The political vision to create this — felt in the new guidelines — must be maintained.

Caught in a crossfire?|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The diplomatic row between Beijing and Ottawa over the detention and treatment of Canadian nationals in China continues to escalate, to the detriment of bilateral relations. But more serious could be the implications of the standoff for the ongoing trade war between China and the U.S. The spat goes back to the detention on December 1 of a top Chinese telecom executive in Vancouver, who has since been released on bail, in response to a U.S. request. Washington wanted custody of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei and the daughter of the company’s founder. Her arrest was part of the U.S. Justice Department’s ongoing criminal probe into the company’s sale of telecommunications equipment to Iran, a potential breach of sanctions against Tehran. But the arrest is also seen in the context of the caution in much of the West against Huawei’s potentially winning bids as 5G communication networks are adopted, on grounds of a security threat. The military background of the Huawei founder has only raised speculation about the firm’s connection to the Chinese defence and intelligence services. Conversely, the U.S. has invoked a rare national security provision under domestic law to impose punitive tariffs on global steel and aluminium imports. A similar investigation is under way specifically to determine the risk to domestic security from alleged Chinese intellectual property abuses. In addition, Beijing’s “Made in China 2025” industrial policy has aroused deep suspicion in the U.S. about the persistence of state subsidies to prop up indigenous firms. It is therefore speculated that Washington has its lens trained on Huawei, which has emerged as the world’s largest telecommunications equipment maker, surpassing Sweden’s Ericsson. Meanwhile, there is concern that Canadian residents in China may face retribution for Ms. Meng’s detention. A Chinese court last week ruled as too lenient the 15-year sentence against a Canadian convicted of drug-related offences. A former diplomat who was arrested has apparently been denied legal representation, although Canadian embassy officials were permitted to visit him. Another Canadian was detained for alleged transgressions of national security. Given the climate of mistrust between the U.S. and China, it is hard to dispel the perception that Canada has got caught in the crossfire. In fact, the Canadian Foreign Minister has suggested that President Donald Trump should desist from using the episode as a bargaining chip in trade disputes with China. But it is conceivable that Chinese trade concessions to de-escalate tensions could pave the way for a resolution of the standoff over Huawei. That would likely satisfy the hawks in Washington who fear that the U.S. is ceding its technological dominance to China.|0|

U.S. demands access to citizen held in Moscow|Washington|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday that the U.S. hopes to gain access soon to a former Marine who was arrested in Russia on espionage charges. Mr. Pompeo, speaking in Brazil, said the U.S. was “hopeful within the next hours we’ll get consular access to see him and get a chance to learn more.” The U.S. has “made clear to the Russians our expectation that we will learn more about the charges and come to understand what it is he’s been accused of and if the detention is not appropriate we will demand his immediate return,” Mr. Pompeo said. Paul Whelan, head of global security for a Michigan-based auto parts supplier, was arrested on Friday. Announcing the arrest three days later, the Russian Federal Security Service said he was caught “during an espionage operation,” but it gave no details. Mr. Whelan, 48, was in Moscow to attend a wedding when he disappeared, his brother David Whelan said on Tuesday. Mr. Whelan’s family said in a statement David Whelan posted on Twitter, “We are deeply concerned for his safety and well-being. His innocence is undoubted and we trust that his rights will be respected.” The Russian spying charges carry a prison sentence of up to 20 years.|0|

U.S. granted access to citizen held in Moscow|Washington|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Russian government said on Wednesday it has allowed an American citizen held on espionage charges to have access to U.S. officials seeking answers about his arrest.

RBI ‘eyes’ solution to read denominations|HYDERABAD|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|In a bid to help the visually challenged, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is scouting for a digital solution that can identify and read out the denomination of Indian currency notes to users. Coming in the backdrop of issuance of new currency notes, the plan is aimed at developing or authenticating a technology-based solution to achieve the task in a few seconds, according to a source familiar with the development. The solution could be a device, software or a combination of both, to help not just the visually challenged, but also those who cannot read in poor lighting, the source said. Following up on an announcement in June, the RBI recently called for an expression of interest (EoI) from entities for a mechanism or device that can detect and read out the denomination. The reason behind the RBI scouting for such solutions is because of the blurring of physical dimensions of the notes that thus far served as the main differentiator. In other words, unlike in the past, the size of the note need not be indicative of denomination. There are also certain Intaglio (raised) printing-based identification marks in currency notes of Rs. 100 and above. The RBI is “sensitive to the challenges faced by visually challenged in conducting their day-to-day business with Indian banknotes,” the statement in June said. Noting that technological progress had opened up new vistas for making banknotes more recognisable for the visually challenged, the bank had announced its decision to explore the feasibility of developing a suitable device or mechanism for aiding them in the identification. As on March 31, 2018, about 102 billion pieces of banknotes were in circulation, having a value of Rs. 18 trillion. This comprised Rs. 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 2000 notes, including the new series being issued since November 2016. The new Rs. 20 note is expected to be released soon. Apart from inviting EoIs, the RBI has formed a panel to go into different aspects, including solutions in practice abroad, which include an app used in the U.S. and a credit card-sized solution in a few other countries.|0|
Scope for India-Iran cooperation|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Shah of Iran said to-night [January 2] there were tremendous possibilities of co-operation between Iran and India and “we must seek to develop it to the maximum possible extent.” Responding to the toast at the State banquet here [New Delhi], he stressed the importance of regional co-operation. “Those who need assistance must be helped.” The Shah traced the historical and cultural ties between the two countries which, he said, “are one of the most ancient of their kind in the world.” Referring to the present relations between the two countries, he said the approach of Iran and India to almost all the problems was very similar. “We attach importance to the dignity of the human being and the freedom of man. It is but natural that, bound by ties of the past and the present, we are seeking closer friendship.” The President, Dr. Zakir Husain, described the visit of the Shah to this country as “a milestone” in Indo-Iranian relations and expressed the “confident hope” that it would renew not only the ancient ties between the two countries but “will also beckon towards a common exercise in the practice of modern ideals of Government.”|0|

Bring bikes in 18% GST slab: Munjal|NEW DELHI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Hero MotoCorp on Wednesday called for reduction in goods and services tax (GST) on motorcycles and two-wheelers to 18% from the current rate of 28%. “Given that two-wheelers provide basic mobility to the masses, there is an urgent need to reduce the GST rate on two-wheelers from the 28% bracket of ‘luxury goods’ to that of 18% for mass usage items,” Hero MotoCorp Chairman Pawan Munjal said in a statement. Mr. Munjal said this would provide the much-needed relief to millions of two-wheeler buyers and the entire value chain dependent on the sector as well. “It is absolutely imperative to ensure growth in the auto sector to create and sustain inclusive economic growth,” he said.|0|
Religion vs religious nationalism|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Any rigid secular approach, unrestrained by considerations of electoral politics, could only lead to disapproval of Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s demonstration of his religious faith and his characterisation of the Congress as a “party of Hinduism”. His approach has been widely termed “soft Hindutva”, and as an attempt to compete with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in its game. Those who deride Hindutva and those who swear by it both consider Mr. Gandhi a poor imitator of it. Centrist politics by definition is vulnerable to criticism from radical perspectives of different hues — for instance, Marxist M.N. Roy, Dalit leader B.R. Ambedkar and Hindutva proponent, and later his assassin, Nathuram Godse, were all critical of Mahatma Gandhi’s ideas of Hinduism. What is worth a closer analysis in the current context is the suggestion that the invocation of Hindu symbols for electoral gains is Hindutva, albeit a softer version. A clear trajectory Mainstream Indian nationalism and Hindu nationalism shared a range of symbols and personalities during their formative decades, and distinguishing one from the other can appear a challenging task often. Consolidation of the Hindu society was a preoccupation of several reformists and leaders of the struggle for independence, who were not linked to Hindutva. In a classic essay written in the 1990s, at the peak of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, historian Sumit Sarkar marked the stages of the evolution of Hindu nationalism in two distinct phases: first from the use of the word Hindu as a geographical marker to ‘Hinduism’, an attempt to codify the cultural and religious practices, and then to Hindutva. Swami Vivekananda was the seer of the first shift. “Of the Swami’s address before the Parliament of Religions, it may be said that when he began to speak it was of the religious ideas of the Hindus but when he ended, Hinduism had been created,” wrote Sister Nivedita, the Swami’s closest disciple. Three decades later Veer Savarkar, who invented Hindutva, did not merely seek to unify Hindus, but tried to achieve it by imagining the other as those who do not consider India their sacred land. While secular nationalism’s adversarial image was imperialism, the edge in Savarkar’s Hindutva was against Muslims and Christians. Vivekananda’s Hinduism had no enemy figure. The political rise of Hindutva has been directly proportionate to the success of its proponents’ attempts to equate itself with Hinduism. The Gandhi-Nehru way For Gandhi, Hinduism was the essence of his existence, but even the avowedly secular Jawaharlal Nehru was not dismissive of faith and tradition.The Discovery of Indiadraws from sacred texts and beliefs; “though I have discarded much of past tradition and custom… yet I do not wish to cut myself off from that past completely,” he wrote in his will, asking for some of his ashes to be immersed in the Ganga. The vertical rise and the horizontal spread of Hindutva challenge its opponents to devise new political idioms. A puritan view is that Hindutva can be challenged only with an unyielding secular paradigm, devoid of Hindu symbols. Those leaders and parties that are directly involved in electoral politics are more conflicted on these questions than those who have the convenience of a quarantined approach. In the early 2000s, when critics began to use the neologism saffronisation to describe the A.B. Vajpayee government’s policies that advanced Hindutva, within the Congress there was a debate on the wisdom of it. A.K. Antony and Digvijay Singh vehemently opposed the expression, arguing that it amounted to legitimising the Hindutva agenda given the cultural association of the colour saffron with sacrifice and renunciation. The Congress discontinued use of the word. Other parties too have used Hindu symbolism and terminology. Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Lalu Prasad, whose mastery of electoral politics broke the Hindutva momentum in Bihar, connects his community to Lord Krishna. “Haathi nahin Ganesh hai, Brahma Vishnu Mahesh hai (this is not merely an elephant, but is Lord Ganesh; and Brahma Vishnu Mahesh)” was the Bahujan Samaj Party’s 2005 slogan referencing its election symbol, the elephant. Groups associated with the Communists Party of India (Marxist) in Kerala recently organised events around Ramayana month. “The Sangh has created a particulate image of Ram, that a majority of the faithful do not relate to,” said V. Sivadasan, CPI(M) State committee member, who was closely associated with the programme. “Given this context, it is the duty of the secularists to come in support of the believers who understand Ram different from the way the RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) tries to make him. All secular people have this responsibility to help protect the plurality of faith that exists among religious people.” Whether or not these attempts add up to a robust and credible challenge to Hindutva is an open question. However, the notion of ‘soft Hindutva’ is detrimental to anti-Hindutva polemics and mobilisation. For one, it ignores the tactical components of electoral politics, which the moralist might dismiss as opportunism, for good reasons. What is more critical is that the notion of expressive faith as ‘soft Hindutva’ is an inadvertent endorsement of the Hindutva claim that it is equivalent to Hinduism. The proponents of Hindutva also acknowledge the existence of ‘hard’ and ‘fringe’ elements within its fold. Categories of soft and hard, being relative terms, trick moderates and offer an alibi to opportunists to side with the softer versions — Vajpayee against L.K. Advani, Mr. Advani against Narendra Modi, and who knows, perhaps Mr. Modi against Yogi Adityanath in the future? Any equivalence between Hinduism and Hindutva, conversely, is taken to mean that any criticism of Hindutva is an attack on Hinduism. That one could be accused of being anti-Hinduism for questioning the logic of building a temple on the site of a destroyed mosque at Ayodhya draws from the logical premise of likening Hinduism to Hindutva. To take another example, the Hindu American Foundation claimed recently that even the questioning of ‘Brahminical patriarchy’ is a an act of Hindu-phobia. To Hindutva’s advantage? And most consequentially, any polemical negation of the wall between Hinduism and Hindutva makes the transition from the first to the second easier. It could even encourage believers to consider Hindutva their natural political abode, if they sense hostility in the anti-Hindutva camp. If non-Hindutva platforms expect temple-goers to explain their conduct, that is not an enticing recruitment pitch. The fact is that there are numerous people who visit temples and even believe in vastu, astrology, tantra, etc. while still being secular in a political and public context. The only politics that benefits from associating Hinduism to Hindutva is Hindutva. The practice of Hinduism, even when it is exhibitionist and for political ends, is not Hindutva — soft or hard. Hindutva stands out for its conceptual clarity, leaving little scope for a spectrum within it. A manifesto for any durable anti-Hindutva politics is still a long way away, but its singular starting point is an assertion of the distinction between Hinduism and Hindutva. Anything else is doomed.

‘Economy on track to maintain high growth rate’|New delhi|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Indian economy is projected to be the fastest-growing major economy in the current year and upcoming fiscal 2019-20, the Finance Ministry said on Wednesday, while emphasising that the government has taken several steps to boost investors’ confidence. The average growth of the economy between 2014-15 and 2017-18 was 7.3%, the fastest among major economies in the world, the Ministry said in its Year End Review 2018. “Indian economy is projected to be the fastest-growing major economy in 2018-19 and 2019-20 [International Monetary Fund October 2018 database]. This is borne [out] by GDP growth of 7.6% in the first half of 2018-19,” it said. The economy is on track to maintain a high growth rate in the current global environment, it added. Highlighting various initiatives taken to improve investor confidence and boost growth, it said there were measures to spur manufacturing, comprehensive reforms in foreign direct investment policy, special package for the textile industry, push to infrastructure development by giving infrastructure status to affordable housing and focus on coastal connectivity.   The direct tax-to-GDP ratio of 5.98% achieved during 2017-18 fiscal is the best in the last 10 years, the Ministry added.  It further said there was a growth of over 80% in the number of tax returns filed in the last four financial years from 3.79 crore in 2013-14 to 6.85 crore in 2017-18.|0|
Breaking the stranglehold|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Last year, on December 22, an incident of bonded labour reached the national headlines, even if only for a fleeting moment. BJP president Amit Shah tweeted on the subject. A week earlier, 52 trafficked labourers had been rescued from a ginger farm in Karnataka where they had been made to work inhuman hours with little pay. Yet, for the most part, both the mainstream discourse and social media commentary miss the underlying phenomenon: bonded labour, India’s secret shame. The practice was abolished under the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976 after the issue found a place in the Emergency-era’s 20-point programme. Four decades on, independent surveys and State government-led committees still point to its myriad forms. The Global Slavery Index 2016 estimated there to be 1.8 crore Indians in modern slavery, including bondedness, while the International Labour Organisation said there were 1.17 crore bonded labourers in 2014. However, there has been no government-led nationwide survey since 1978, despite each district having been given Rs. 4.5 lakh for such surveys. Instead, the government relies on rescue and rehabilitation numbers: Since 1976, over 3.13 lakh people have been rescued, with Karnataka topping the list (nearly 66,300 people). This does not reflect the extent of the prevalence of bonded labour, as most labourers are not aware of the Act and turn to the authorities only when it becomes overtly violent. Moreover, National Crime Records Bureau data show that not all cases are reported by the police. Between 2014 and 2016, they recorded just 1,338 victims, with 290 police cases filed — a stark difference from 5,676 rescues reported by six States in this period. This becomes important given the structure of the disbursal of rehabilitation funds: Rs. 20,000 is given as immediate relief while the rest (which depends on the case) is given only after conviction of the accused. In these three years, only 28 cases (of the 334 in trial) saw judicial resolution, resulting in a conviction rate of just 32%. It is no surprise that the Centre has had to spend just Rs. 7.65 crore on rehabilitation in this period. Some patterns emerge. Traffickers continue to source labour in socio-economically backward districts, an example being Bolangir in Odisha. Tribals and Dalits remain vulnerable. Advances and small loans accompanied by promises of steady pay are tools of entrapment. Brick kilns, quarries, horticulture farms, shoe and plastic factories in metropolises are venues for this practice. The Ministry of Labour says, “The root of the problem lies in the social customs and economic compulsions,” before listing a “multi-pronged” strategy which focusses solely on rescue and rehabilitation processes. However, a preventive measure, which must start with a survey, is missing. Creating financial access for vulnerable communities/vulnerable districts could help. Further, regulatory attention must focus on trafficking rings and sectors. The writer is a Principal Correspondent at The Hindu’s Bengaluru bureau|0|

All along the coastline|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|What changes will the notification bring? The Cabinet has approved a significant relaxation of development controls along the coastline through the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification 2018, as part of a plan to encourage construction of buildings and launch tourism activities in areas that are closer to the high tide line. State governments and others had made representations, calling for a review of coastal management policies. Recommendations for changes were then made by the Shailesh Nayak Committee. The Centre has taken the view that both affordable housing availability and tourism will grow if restrictions on coastal zones are relaxed. With this objective, a decision has been taken to permit current Floor Space Index (FSI) or Floor Area Ratio (FAR) in urban areas coming under CRZ-II — which governs the size of buildings — as on the date of the new notification. This does away with the restrictions on construction which date back to the Development Control Rules of 1991. The CRZ-II urban category, as per the CRZ notification of 2011, pertains to areas “that have been developed up to or close to the shoreline”, and are legally designated municipal limits already provided with roads, water supply, sewerage connections and so on.  What about rural areas? For rural areas, the newly approved notification adds a sub-category to CRZ-III. The new provision, CRZ-III A, applies development restrictions to a much smaller area of 50 metres from the high tide line, compared to the 200 metres that was earmarked as the no development zone (NDZ) earlier for densely populated areas. These are defined as places with a population of 2,161 per sq km as per the 2011 Census. Areas with a population density below that will continue to have 200 metres as the NDZ. However, for tourism expansion, the new scheme will allow temporary facilities such as shacks, toilet blocks and changing rooms, maintaining only a slim margin of 10 metres from the high tide line. The system of granting clearances has also been changed. States will have the authority to approve proposals for urban (CRZ-II) and rural (CRZ-III) areas. The Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change will grant clearances for ecologically sensitive areas (CRZ-I), and areas falling between the low tide line and 12 nautical miles seaward. The modifications also include demarcation of a 20-metre no development zone for all islands and guidelines to deal with sensitive areas.  What will be the likely impact? When the draft of the new CRZ notification was published in 2018, concerns were raised that it ignored two major issues: maintaining a well demarcated hazard line and factoring in the effects of climate change on sea levels. The disastrous impacts of periodic cyclones show that coastlines will become even more vulnerable. Protection of fishers poses a challenge, since the relaxation of development controls could subject them to severe commercial pressures. The decision to allow construction andtourist facilities closer to the coast may boost employment and grow local business, but without strong environmental safeguards, these could damage fragile ecosystems.|0|
Achrekar, Tendulkar’s guru, passes away|MUMBAI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Ramakant Achrekar, who has honed a battery of Test cricketers including Sachin Tendulkar, died at his residence here on Wednesday. He was 86. Achrekar served as a cricket coach on the Mumbai maidans for more than four three decades until he was paralysed in the late 1990s. At least a dozen of disciples — including Balwinder Singh Sandhu, Chandrakant Pandit, Lalchand Rajput, Tendulkar, Vinod Kambli, Pravin Amre, Sameer Dighe, Ajit Agarkar, Paras Mhambrey, Ramesh Powar — represented India in Tests and many others succeeded in first-class cricket. “Cricket in heaven will be enriched with the presence of Achrekar sir. Like many of his students, I learnt my ABCD of cricket under Sir’s guidance,” Tendulkar said of his beloved coach-cum-mentor. “His contribution to my life cannot be captured in words. He built the foundation that I stand on.” Tendulkar, along with Kambli and Amre, visited Achrekar’s residence in Dadar and paid their respect. The last rites will be performed on Thursday morning. Dronacharya in 1990 In recognition of his contribution as coach, he was honoured with the Dronacharya Award in 1990. Later in 2010, he was awarded the Padma Shri. After being a regular on the Mumbai maidans in the 1940s and 1950s, he founded the Kamath Memorial Cricket Club at Shivaji Park in Dadar and continued to hone budding youngsters till he had a paralytic attack in the late 1990s. He was considered to be among the most selfless coaches in local cricket. Besides grooming cricketers, such was his emphasis on discipline that many of proteges have developed into coaches of repute. Rajput has coached three international teams, while Pandit and Amre are among the most respected and successful coaches in domestic cricket. Mhambrey is the bowling coach of India A while Sulakshan Kulkarni and Amol Muzumdar have been excelling as coaches in the domestic arena and Indian Premier League. Dinesh Lad, the coach of Rohit Sharma and father of Mumbai captain Siddhesh, is also a protege of Achrekar.  He was a special man. Many of us got to know Mumbai by riding on his scooter all over the city for playing matches. — Ajit Agarkar,former India bowler|0|
China growth woes roil Indian markets|MUMBAI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|A weak trend in the global equity markets on the back of disappointing economic data from China led to the Indian benchmarks shedding 1% on Wednesday as investors became jittery over the near-term outlook on equities. The 30-share Sensex fell below the psychological 36,000-mark while losing 363.05 points, or 1%, to close at 35,891.52. During intraday trades, the benchmark was down nearly 520 points to touch a low of 35,734.01. The negative sentiment was further corroborated by the weak market breadth as more than 1,600 stocks lost ground on the BSE, as against only 923 gainers. All the broader indices, including BSE SmallCap and BSE Midcap, ended the day in the red on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the 50-share Nifty closed at 10,792.50, down 117.60 points or 1.08%. Elsewhere in Asia, Hang Seng lost a whopping 715 points or nearly 3% with South Korea’s Kospi and Taiwan’s TSEC indices also shedding over 1% each. Most European markets were also trading in the red at the time of writing. Market participants attributed the weakness to the contraction in the manufacturing activity — the first in 19 months — in China. Incidentally, data showed that factory activity has shrunk in other Asian economies such as Malaysia, Taiwan and South Korea, too. Earnings season The upcoming results season, beginning next week, also acted as a catalyst for the fall in the Indian market as investors have turned cautious amid a global bearish trend, they added. Auto and metal stocks bore the brunt on Wednesday with Vedanta, Tata Steel, M&M, Tata Motors, Maruti Suzuki and Hero Motocorp among the top losers in the Sensex pack. Both Vedanta and Tata Steel lost more than 4% each on Wednesday amid concerns of a global slowdown. Both the BSE Metal and BSE Auto indices were the worst hit among sectoral indices, shedding over 3% each. Weak GST collections The weakness in equities spilled into the currency markets with the rupee falling over 1% against the dollar to close the day at 70.18. The rupee opened lower at 69.60 and fell further to touch the day’s low of 70.23-a- dollar. Strengthening of the dollar against all major global currencies apart from unfavourble domestic factors like weak GST collection also contributed to the rupee’s fall. Brent crude, the global benchmark, was trading higher at $56.20 per barrel after falling to $52.51.|0|
Jet Airways misses payments to banks|Mumbai|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Jet Airways India Ltd. has missed payment to lenders, prompting ratings agency ICRA to downgrade the rating to ‘D’ or default grade due to the default and the inability of the airline to mobilise funds to improve liquidity. The share price of the air carrier ended the day with a decline of 6.16% on the BSE. In a filing with the stock exchanges, Jet Airways said payment of interest and principal instalment due on December 31 to a consortium of Indian banks led by State Bank of India “has been delayed due to temporary cashflow mismatch” and that the company “has engaged with them in relation to the same.” The filing did not specify the amount due. “The ratings downgrade considers the delays by the company in the payment of the interest and principal instalment due on December 31, 2018 due to cash flow mismatches. There have been delays in the implementation of the proposed liquidity initiatives by the management, which have aggravated its liquidity,” ICRA said in a report. Salary delays “The company has already been delaying its employee salary payments and lease rental payments to the aircraft lessors. Furthermore, the company has large debt repayments due over December 2018 to March 2019 (Rs. 1,700 crore), FY2020 (Rs. 2,444.5 crore) and FY2021 (Rs. 2,167.9 crore), it added. As on September 30, 2018, the company had a gross debt of Rs. 8,411 crore, as against Rs. 8,403 crore, as on March 31, 2018. This, despite the receipt of lease incentives during June 2018 and advances from Jet Privilege Private Ltd. in October 2018. “The debt levels are, however, expected to increase in the near term because of the ongoing stress on profitability, unless the company is successful in its liquidity initiatives. Overall, till the company starts reporting profits on a sustained basis, the debt levels are expected to continue to remain high,” the ratings agency said. The company has repayments of Rs. 1,700 crore due over December 2018 to March 2019, Rs. 2,444.5 crore in FY2020 and Rs. 2,167.9 crore in FY2021. In the absence of adequate cash accruals, the company requires refinancing for its repayments falling due. The company’s liquidity position is stressed with operating losses, high debt levels and negative networth, the report said. The stock tanked 6.16% to close at Rs. 263.75 on the BSE. The company’s market valuation slumped by Rs. 195.87 crore to Rs. 2,996.13 crore on the BSE. (With PTI inputs)|0|
Coal India output drops in December|KOLKATA|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Production at the eight coal-producing subsidiaries of Coal India Ltd.(CIL) rose by 7.4 % in the first three quarters of fiscal 2019, although the Maharatna PSU closed December with a marginal 0.9% production drop, according to a regulatory filing. Output in the nine-month period between April and December 2018 rose by 7.4% over a year ago, to touch 412.5 million tonnes. Asansol–based Eastern Coalfields Ltd., producing some of the best coal grades, clocked the highest growth rate of 17.2%, followed by Western Coal Fields based in Nagpur. However, Bharat Coking Coal Ltd., based in Dhanbad, showed a production decline for these nine months. A 20.2 % decline was seen in December 2018. South Eastern Coalfields in Chhattisgarh also closed the month with a production slowdown. In respect of coal offtake, a 5.5% growth was reported for the period under review, with a slowdown in December 2018. A CIL press brief said that the PSU increased its supplies to thermal power stations by 25.5 million tonnes during the nine months. Pithead coal stocks, which were 23.4 million tonnes at end-December, were also slowly building up at CIL-end, according to an official.|0|
GST shortfall|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Revenue collections from the Goods and Services Tax (GST) are going too far off the mark for comfort. Inflows declined for the second consecutive month in December to Rs. 94,726 crore from Rs. 97,637 crore in November and Rs. 1,00,710 crore in the month before. Between April and December, GST collections have averaged about Rs. 96,800 crore, and have not even once met the monthly target of Rs. 1,06,300 crore, going by the Union Budget math for 2018-19. Now in order to achieve the year-end target, GST collections over the next three months will have to reach an average of Rs. 1,34,900 crore. But given the spate of tax rate cuts announced by the GST Council in December that kick in this month and Prime Minister Narendra Modi hinting at further rationalisation of rates for construction materials soon, the pressure on revenues is likely to persist. Separately, as the government looks to woo traders and small businesses back to its electoral fold, the Council is considering a relaxation in the GST norms for micro, small and medium enterprises by raising the annual sales threshold for compulsory GST registration from Rs. 20 lakh to over Rs. 50 lakh. Such a relaxation, along with regulatory steps like greater forbearance for small business loans, will boost sentiment among such firms, but it will further dent the tax kitty. Other revenue heads, including direct tax or disinvestment receipts (even via innovatively structured intra-public-sector deals), are unlikely to be adequate to plug the GST shortfall. This poses a challenge for the Centre at a time when it would have been hoping to announce some populist measures ahead of elections, while retaining its macro-economic management credentials. States’ revenue collections under the GST regime have been uneven and a GST Council panel is examining inter-State variations. But the Centre is bound to compensate States for revenue shortfalls for the first five years of the GST regime. Unless the Centre decides to drop its fiscal deficit goals, a squeeze on spending, including planned capital expenditure, may be the only option. There is a more problematic aspect to the dip in GST collections, based on economic activity and compliance trends in November. The total number of returns filed that month hit a high of 72 lakh from 55 lakh at the beginning of the fiscal, yet revenues fell. November also marked the onset of India’s festive season, with a late Deepavali. Yet, the higher compliance and the festive fervour translated into collections lower than the average monthly receipts for the year till date. Though India’s growth fell to 7.1% in the second quarter of this fiscal, an uptick in private investment over the same period was considered a sign of revival. But if consumers are not confident enough to spend, a consumption-led investment revival to take the economy to an 8% growth path seems elusive again.|0|
Abhimanyu stars in Bengal’s sizzling chase|KOLKATA|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Opener Abhimanyu Easwaran scored a magnificent unbeaten century to lead Bengal to a much-needed seven-wicket victory over Delhi on the concluding day of their Ranji Trophy Group B match at the Eden Gardens here on Wednesday. Chasing 322 for win, Bengal resumed at 18 for no loss and gained massively from Abhimanyu’s 211-ball 183 not out, during which he contributed in two key hundred-plus partnerships, to make a fine comeback and record its highest ever run chase. Bengal, which collected six points to aggregate 22 and be seventh, remains in the hunt for a quarterfinal place. It will host Punjab in its last group match. Openers Abhimanyu and Abhishek Raman began the day with positive intent. The duo did not let the good deliveries and half-chances affect their focus. They rotated the strike and hit the loose deliveries to the ropes to score at a fast pace and put pressure on Delhi’s fielders. Abhishek (52 off 73, 7x4), who got a ‘life’ on 22, played some fluent drives to the fence to get his fourth half-century of the season. The 121-run opening stand ended when Abhishek threw away his wicket, caught at deep extra-cover. Sudip Chatterjee and Manoj Tiwary departed cheaply because of Kulwant Khejroliya’s superb bowling as Bengal lost three wickets quickly before lunch. However, Abhimanyu batted responsibly to forge an unbroken stand of 186 runs with experienced hand Anustup Majumder (69 not out off 122, 8x4) to thwart Delhi. Abhimanyu exploited the Delhi bowlers’ lack of discipline to cut, pull and drive confidently on both sides. Apart from 23 boundaries, he hit two lovely sixes in his ninth hundred and second of the season. Majumder executed some good-looking shots while assisting Abhimanyu. Their effort reminded one of a 175-run partnership between the two in Jaipur, where Bengal knocked out Ranji champion Gujarat in the quarterfinals last season. Khejroliya’s freak injury in the post-lunch session helped Bengal. Abhimanyu, who achieved 3000 runs and hit the winning boundary, was satisfied with his knock. “Keeping the wickets was the key. We played every ball on merit,” said the 23-year-old. The scores: Delhi — 1st innings: 240. Bengal — 1st innings: 220. Delhi — 2nd innings: 301. Bengal — 2nd innings: Abhishek Raman c Sudan b Rana 52, Abhimanyu Easwaran (not out) 183, Sudip Chatterjee lbw b Khejroliya 2, Manoj Tiwary c Chandela b Khejroliya 5, Anustup Majumder (not out) 69; Extras (b-10, lb-2): 12; Total (for three wickets in 70.2 overs): 323. Fall of wickets: 1-121, 2-127, 3-137. Delhi bowling: Khejroliya 16-0-68-2, Bhati 15-2-66-0, Sudan 8-0-45-0, Shivam 8.2-0-33-0, Vashisth 15-1-77-0, Rana 8-0-22-1.|0|
Epoch-making series win beckons|Sydney|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Making history is never easy. India first toured Australia in 1947-48. And a Test series triumph down under has proved elusive. Now, Virat Kohli and his men, with a 2-1 lead entering the fourth Test at the SCG, have a gilt-edged opportunity to accomplish an epoch-making series victory with either a draw or a win. Turn it on Staring at such a monumental achievement, India has to show character and single-mindedness in the big game beginning here on Thursday. Going for a 3-1 verdict is the better option for Kohli’s side. The Indians should not leave behind their attacking instincts. India has been up against some great Australian teams in the past. Tim Paine’s side is a weakened batting outfit and India has to be ruthless. The conditions here could suit India. The pitch, with a light covering of grass, should assist the spinners as the match progresses. The SCG has the reputation of being the most spinner-friendly pitch in Australia. The sun has been blazing in these parts too and the heat could open up cracks on the surface, further assisting the spinners. This is precisely why the presence of its two leading spinners, R. Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja, is so crucial for India. Will he, won’t he? There was plenty of drama on the eve of the Test. First, Virat Kohli, addressing the media, ruled out Ashwin’s participation in the match. “He is not 100% fit. He is as disappointed as we are. Ashwin is really important to our Test plans,” the Indian skipper said. Yet, over an hour later, India announced a 13-member squad for the Test with Ashwin’s name in it. What had transpired to put the off-spinning all-rounder back in contention? Ashwin seemed to have made a good recovery from an abdominal strain — he has been bowling and batting at the nets — but the injury appeared to have flared up on Wednesday morning. When Kohli spoke to the media, he had this information with him. And Ashwin would not play, he said. Subsequently, the physio found out that it was not a relapse but only a niggle that settled down soon. Ashwin too felt much better and his name was included in the list. If Ashwin doesn’t suffer a fitness setback in the morning, the off-spinner will team up with left-armer Jadeja here. The pair could sting at the SCG. In case, Ashwin fails to make the cut, left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav could come into the eleven. Ishant ruled out Seamer Ishant Sharma has been ruled out with strained ribs and India might go into the Test with just two pacemen — the in-form Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami. K.L. Rahul is likely to return to the opening slot. This means Hanuma Vihari will be pushed back into the middle-order, in place of Rohit Sharma. India will be hoping to win the toss, put up a mammoth score and then turn the screws on the Australians as the ball starts turning from day three. Australia has major batting concerns. Usman Khawaja could open with Marcus Harris with the out of form Aaron Finch left out. Peter Handscomb, a fine player of spin, could emerge in the middle-order. And Marcus Labuschagne, who can supplement his batting with useful leg-spin bowling, should come in for the underwhelming Mitchell Marsh. Nathan Lyon’s match-winning skills on these tracks are well known. The Indians will need to be positive against the off-spinner. The next few days here will be massive for Indian cricket. The teams (from): India: Virat Kohli (Capt.), K.L. Rahul, Mayank Agarwal, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane, Hanuma Vihari, Rishabh Pant (wk), R. Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Mohammed Shami, Jasprit Bumrah, Kuldeep Yadav and Umesh Yadav.

Batsmen have to pull their weight for Kerala|MOHALI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Bowlers win matches, but the batsmen have to give them some runs to bowl with! Kerala is finding that out this Ranji Trophy season. Its chances of qualifying for the knock-out have slimmed, following the 10-wicket loss to Punjab here on Tuesday. Not only it has to win its last match against Himachal Pradesh, but hope to have favourable results in others as well. It was among the top contenders till recently though, thanks to its stunning victories over former champions Delhi and Bengal. In a season in which giants like Mumbai and Tamil Nadu have fallen, Kerala has indeed done very well to keep intact the reputation it gained last year, when it made it to the quarterfinals for the first time ever. Coach Dav Whatmore and skipper Sachin Baby deserve credit for that. As do pacers Sandeep Warrier and Basil Thampi as well as off-spinner Jalaj Saxena, who have bowled beautifully. Warrier and Saxena have taken 28 wickets each and have had five five-wicket hauls between them. Thampi has 21 wickets. Together, they form one of the most potent attacks in the competition. But, when you find Saxena also at the top of Kerala’s batting charts and that he is the only one who has scored more than 400 runs (479 at 43.54), you will realise that the team has got some serious issues with its batting. The next highest scorer is Baby, who has made 360. The only other player to score more than 300 is Vishnu Vinod, one of the few bright spots for Kerala batting. He had made an astounding 193 not out, coming in at No. 8, against Madhya Pradesh and batted sensibly in both innings here, too. The only man to outscore him was Mohammed Azharuddeen, whose maiden hundred underlined his obvious talent. The 24-year-old is a strokemaker of quality and needs to be persisted with. If he shows some restraint when required, like he did here, he could solve one of Kerala’s several problems at the top of the order. Opener P. Rahul has made good use of the limited opportunities that have come his way, but his partner Arun Karthik has been a disappointment (200 at 20); so has Kerala’s most gifted cricketer, Sanju Samson (215 at 21.5). That none of the Kerala batsman is in the list of top-50 run-getters will tell a lot. If you want to make progress as a team, you need batsmen who can deliver in all conditions.|0|
India capable of entering second round of AFC Asian cup: I.M. Vijayan|Thiruvananthapuram|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Former Indian International and Arjuna awardee I.M. Vijayan has high expectations about the Indian football team which will take part in the AFC Asian Cup which will begin in UAE on Saturday. I.M. Vijayan, who is set to leave for UAE as Government Observer, feels that Indian team is capable of qualifying for the knock out round. “We have improved a lot under present coach Constantine. The Indian team qualified for the AFC Cup quite early without any last minute hiccups. “The draws against strong sides China and Oman in the friendlies have showed that we belong to big league. “The confidence in the team is very high. I think we can beat Thailand and Bahrain but UAE as host will be a tough team to beat. “The team is capable of qualifying for the knock out round if we play to our potential,’’ said Vijayan who was in the city on an official visit. “The current Indian team has a heady mix of experienced players and youngsters. Coach Constantine has given chances to many youngsters and he always ensures that the playing XI has at least two or three young players who can play attacking football. ‘Play attacking game’  “I think as a team in UAE we should play an open attacking game and score goals from chances we get. “Sunil Chhetri of course will be the main player for India upfront,’’ said Vijayan. Vijayan, who watched Kerala Blasters Reserves team play a goalless draw against SBI Kerala at the Chandrasekharan Nair stadium, said that the Kerala Blasters’ reserve side played aggressively than the senior side which in a way summed up KBFC’s disastrous ISL season.|0|
‘China Dec. factory activity shrinks’|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|China’s factory activity contracted for the first time in 19 months in December as domestic and export orders continued to weaken, a private survey showed. The gloomy readings largely dovetailed with an official survey on Monday which showed growing strains on China’s manufacturing sector, a key source of jobs. The findings reinforce views the economy is losing more steam. The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for December, released on Wednesday, fell to 49.7 from 50.2 in November, marking the first contraction since May 2017. New orders — an indicator of future activity — fell for the first time in two and a half years, with companies reporting subdued demand despite some price discounting. New export orders shrank for the ninth month in a row. While production edged higher after two months of stagnation, factories cut jobs for the 62nd month in a row. “External demand remained subdued due to the trade frictions between China and the U.S., while domestic demand weakened more notably,” said Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group. “It is looking increasingly likely that the Chinese economy may come under greater downward pressure,” said Mr. Zhengsheng. The Caixin/Markit survey focuses mostly on smaller businesses, which are believed to be more export-oriented. China’s official PMI showed factory activity contracted for the first time in over two years, also pressured by weak demand at home and abroad. It suggested small and mid-sized firms were seeing a sharper deterioration in business conditions than larger companies, a trend that policymakers have repeatedly tried to address through special loan programmes and steps to reduce operating costs. With business conditions expected to get worse before they get better, China is expected to roll out more support measures in coming months on top of a raft of initiatives in 2018. The country’s top leaders, at an annual meeting in December, pledged to cut taxes and keep liquidity ample while pushing forward trade talks with the U.S.|0|

Merchant exporters to get Rs. 600 crore sops|New Delhi|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The government on Wednesday decided to provide 3% interest subsidy to merchant exporters to enhance flow of funds for them with a view to boosting outbound shipments. The decision was taken by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs. “The proposal will entail benefits of around Rs. 600 crore to exporters on interest equalisation for the remaining period of the scheme,” an official release said. Interest equalisation Approval has been given to the proposal of the Department of Commerce for “including merchant exporters under the interest equalisation scheme for pre and post shipment rupee export credit by allowing them interest equalisation rate of 3% on such credit for export of products covered under 416 tariff lines (products) identified under the scheme,” the release said. These products are largely in MSME/labour-intensive sectors such as agriculture, textiles, leather, handicraft and machinery.|0|
AFI’s qualification guidelines for Asian Championships|KOCHI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Athletics Federation of India has announced its qualification guidelines for the Asian championships in Doha, Qatar, in April (21-24). According to the guidelines announced on Wednesday, the Federation Cup in Patiala (March 15-18) will be the final selection meet for the Asians and athletes are expected to achieve the qualification standards there. However, the AFI may exempt a few select elite athletes from taking part in the Federation Cup and they will be eligible for selection. The selectors will take the final decision on these athletes.

Only one athlete per event will be selected for an event and if more athletes qualify, the selection committee will decide about the second entry depending on medal chances. If no one qualifies, the selection committee may pick an athlete if there is a chance of winning a medal. Selected athletes are to report any injury, illness or change in their training status that could affect their chances and also fill in details of the supplements and medications they are currently using and will be taking before and after the meet. Athletes have also been asked to strictly adhere to the AFI’s ‘no-needle policy’.

A 41-time Ranji champion, but now...|NAGPUR|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Two months ago, after winning its first Vijay Hazare Trophy title in 12 years, Mumbai’s cricket fraternity was upbeat about adding yet another Ranji Trophy title to its cabinet of 41 trophies. Cut to the New Year’s day — exactly two months since the Ranji season started (Nov. 1) — Mumbai’s quest came to a grinding halt with a humiliating innings defeat to defending champion Vidarbha, with more than a day left in the game. So what exactly has gone wrong in the last two months? Everything. From the unavailability of top cricketers to injuries to key players to loss of form of the supposed senior players to the youngsters’ inability to grab opportunities to unwillingness of some of the seniors to put team before self to inability of the leadership group (including selectors) on tactical as well as man-management front... all the factors have combined to result in Mumbai featuring in the lower half of both Group A and the combined points table of top two groups for most of the season. The fact that Mumbai has tried out a whopping 24 cricketers — including six debutants — and frequently tinkered the team reflects its desperation. Only three players — Siddhesh Lad, Aditya Tare and Shivam Dube — have featured in all seven games, and with the inconsistent run Tare has had with the willow, it won’t be a surprise if he makes way for a new ’keeper for the concluding fixture against Chhattisgarh. Defensive mindset Ever since it decided against pressing for an outright win in its season-opener against Railways, the defensive mindset was on display. And as the season progressed, Mumbai appeared a disjointed unit on the field. With an inexperienced bowling attack for a better part of the season, Mumbai required a strong leadership group. But neither of the two captains — Dhawal Kulkarni and Lad — nor coach Vinayak Samant, appeared to be impressive on the tactical front. As a result, field settings went for a toss on a regular basis. It was up to the batting group to make up for the rookie bowlers. However, barring Lad and Dube, none of the batsmen were even remotely consistent. Only positive The only positive for the season was Dube, the all-rounder who was playing his first full season. He was consistent with the bat lower down the order and picked precious wickets in most of his spells. But in the end, with little support from others, Dube could only improve on his numbers rather than carrying the burden of the team. It seems the Mumbai Cricket Association officials, in consultation with the Cricket Improvement Committee, have some tough decisions to make during the off-season. But with MCA in disarray, one wonders if things can fall in place at least before the next season.|0|
Anderson survives a Djere scare|PUNE|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The timing of the Tata Open Maharashtra, just after the off-season, is ideal to make its stars vulnerable. At the Balewadi Stadium here on Wednesday, the tournament’s top three seeds found that out first-hand. Second seed Hyeon Chung bit the dust, going down 7-6(2), 6-2 to Latvian Ernests Gulbis, before top-ranked Kevin Anderson, and then the defending champion Gilles Simon, had to mine every bit of their reserve to come through. Anderson required two tie-breaks to despatch Serb Laslo Djere 7-6(3), 7-6(6) and Simon, three sets to ward off Belarus’ Ilya Ivashka 6-7(3), 6-2, 6-1. It was Anderson’s match which caused maximum angst for the fans. In Djere, the 6’8” South African had an opponent who would never consider defeat. There were four breaks of serve in the first eight games and with neither player ready to blink, it took a tie-break to settle matters. At 4-3, however Anderson hit two aces before a botched forehand volley from Djere handed him the set. Even in the second, the two were neck and neck till 3-3. It was then that Anderson loosened up slightly and made the play. He went up 40-15 on the Djere serve, but couldn’t land the break. Djere responded, surging ahead 30-0 when Anderson was serving at 5-6, and even reached a set point, only to meet the same fate. The match, inevitably, slipped into another tie-break, and was decided by the narrowest of margins. At 6-6, Djere’s sliced backhand travelled only as far as the net and on matchpoint another backhand sailed long. The Chung-Gulbis contest was relatively more straightforward. The South Korean did race to a 4-0 lead and serve for the set thrice — at 5-2, at 5-4 and 6-5 — but apart from that initial phase, he seldom looked in control. Gulbis’ ranking of 95 is deceptive at best, and he displayed all the tact worthy of a former top-10 player, who counts amongst his best achievements a win over Roger Federer at Roland Garros in 2014. For a consummate shotmaker, he showed remarkable patience and his defence stood out. But he was clinical when it mattered, taking the first set tiebreak for the loss of just two points. A complete breakdown of the Chung backhand in the second set brought down the curtains. One-set all Ramkumar Ramanathan and fourth seed Malek Jaziri were tied at one set apiece in their second round match at the time of going to press. While Ramkumar took the first set 7-6(3), the World No. 45 restored parity by winning the second 7-6(5). The Indian in fact had multiple opportunities to force the issue, but fluffed four break points and squandered a 3-0 lead in the tie-break. The results (second round): Singles: Ernests Gulbis (Lat) bt Hyeon Chung (Kor) 7-6(2), 6-2; Kevin Anderson (RSA) bt Laslo Djere (Srb) 7-6(3), 7-6(6); Gilles Simon (Fra) bt Ilya Ivashka (Blr) 6-7(3), 6-2, 6-1; Ivo Karlovic (Cro) bt Evgeny Donskoy (Rus) 6-4, 7-5; Benoit Paire (Fra) bt Jiri Vesely (Cze) 6-4, 6-2; Jaume Munar (Esp) bt Simone Bolelli (Ita) 7-5, 6-0; Steve Darcis (Bel) bt Michael Mmoh (USA) 4-6, 7-6(4), 6-2. Doubles: Luke Bambridge & Jonny O'Mara (GBR) bt Sriram Balaji & Arjun Kadhe 7-6(5), 6-1.|0|
More, Shreyas send Chhattisgarh to its doom|Bengaluru|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|A spectacular Chhattisgarh collapse in the final session handed Karnataka a 198-run victory on the last day of their Ranji Trophy encounter, at Alur grounds here on Wednesday. The six points gained helped Karnataka take a giant step towards sealing a quarterfinal berth. Chhattisgarh, given a tricky target of 355 in 72 overs, looked set to force a draw at 117 for two. From here, the visitor lost eight wickets in 14.3 overs. Pacer Ronit More took four wickets to finish with a match-haul of nine for 83. More kept it simple, attacking the stumps as the pitch kept low and offered little movement. More’s dream season, which now includes three five-fors and two four-fors, makes him the highest wicket-taker of the team with 27 wickets. He was ably supported by leg-spinner Shreyas Gopal, who picked up four wickets as well. Shreyas kept it full, and used flight variations to reap big rewards. Karnataka was helped by some poor shot selection by the Chhattisgarh batsmen, who failed to show patience and stay the course. Implosion begins Trouble started on the last ball before Tea, when the set Amandeep Khare (35, 93b) lunged forward and edged a length delivery from Shreyas to Vinay Kumar at slip. The spinner then snatched the crucial wicket of Avnish Singh (61, 142b, 8x4), who missed a full ball and was trapped leg-before. Skipper Harpreet Singh, centurion in the first essay, needlessly poked at one outside off and gave Devdutt Padikkal a simple catch at gully. Chhattisgarh, now staring down the barrel of a gun, meekly waved the white flag. Pandey’s 19th century Earlier, resuming on 113 for four, Karnataka batted for 23 overs and declared on 219 for seven. Captain Manish Pandey, on 57 overnight, reached his 19th first-class century with a crisp boundary through cover. A. Mithun used the long handle well, smacking a couple of big sixes over mid-wicket, to make an unbeaten 17-ball 33. There were fears that Karnataka had left the declaration for too late, but the bowlers ensured that the job was completed with 15 overs to spare for close of play. Karnataka (27 points) takes on Baroda in their final group game, at Vadodara. Chhatisgarh (6 points), which also has one game to go, has no chance of making it to the knockout rounds. The scores: Karnataka — 1st innings: 418. Chhattisgarh — 1st innings: 283. Karnataka — 2nd innings: Devdutt Padikkal b Mandal 19, D. Nischal b Pankaj 5, Liyan Khan b Pankaj 5, K.V.

India manufacturing PMI slows in Dec.|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Indian manufacturing activity expanded at a slower pace in December, as growth in new orders and output waned, despite factories cutting their prices, a private survey showed on Wednesday. The Nikkei Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index, compiled by IHS Markit, declined to 53.2 in December, below November’s 54.0 reading and a Reuters poll median of 53.6. But that was above the 50 mark, which separates growth from contraction, for the 17th month and manufacturing activity registered its strongest quarterly performance since late 2012. The manufacturing PMI “indicated that the sector ended 2018 on a high, with growth stronger than seen at the start of the year,” noted Pollyanna De Lima, principal economist at IHS Markit. “Output continued to rise strongly, in line with a robust upswing in sales. Companies benefited from rising international demand for Indian goods, as export orders expanded for the fourteenth straight month.” Although new orders and output expanded at a slower rate last month, both have remained well in expansion territory for more than a year, supported by weaker inflationary pressures. December saw the weakest increase in input costs for nearly three years, giving factories room to cut their prices for the first time since July 2017.|0|

SCG curator promises a ‘fair contest’|Sydney|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The fourth Test will be the first Test of the series not to be played on a drop-in pitch. And curator Justin Groves has been a busy man, moving around the ground, answering questions. Even as Australia sought to maintain its proud unbeaten record in a home Test series against India, Groves, who was under increasing pressure from former Aussie stars to prepare a surface that offered help to the seamers, believed he had made a pitch that had something in it for everyone. But then, the pitches at the SCG, lately, have either helped the spinners or been flat as it was in India’s tour game ahead of the ongoing series. Groves said, “There will be a green tinge on days one and two. The pitch will start turning late in the game and become unpredictable as the game progresses. I am really happy with it. There will be some surprises.” He added, “It’s been hot and humid here. So we’ve got enough moisture in the pitch to make it last five days and produce a fair contest.”|0|
Paine determined to put up a good fight|Sydney|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Australian captain Tim Paine said his focus in the series had been to play the best cricket his team could, stay competitive at all times and learn quickly. “We want to win every Test we play, at times it’s not always possible. We’re playing against the best Test team in the world at the moment.” Even as Australia faces the prospect of losing a Test series on home soil for the first time against India, Paine said, “I haven’t thought too much about losing the series, that’s for sure. We know if can keep India in the fight long enough, as we showed in Perth, we can win.” Performers needed The team selection has come under criticism and Paine said, “We want to pick the best eleven but at the same time we want to ensure that we have the right kind of guys in the team who can take the side forward and perform across series and conditions.” Paine wanted the batting group to convert starts into big scores. “Obviously, there has been a lot of talk around that.” On leg-spinning all-rounder Marnus Labuschagne, Paine said, “We know how good a cricketer he is, he’s really skilled in all facets of the game. “His leg spin’s improved out of sight.” Praise for Pant Commenting on Rishabh Pant’s picture with his kids, Paine said: “That was interesting. We were at the PM’s house and just had a quick chat with Rishabh and my wife actually happened to be there, so we just grabbed a quick photo. “He was a good sport, and he is on the field as well, to be honest.”|0|
Srikanth downs Sugiarto|Ahmedabad|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Over the last four years India’s Kidambi Srikanth and Indonesia’s Tommy Sugiarto have been engaged in pulsating contests. Recently, Srikanth notched up a three-game win against Sugiarto in a World Tour Super 750 series in China to restore career scores at 3-3. Their intense rivalry once again came to the fore in the second men’s singles match, after Bengaluru Raptors and Delhi Dashers split the opening two Trump matches in the Vodafone PBL at ‘The Arena by SE TransStadia’ here on Wednesday. After a tussle the Raptors captain, Srikanth came through in three games. Both Srikanth and Sugiarto are top 10 ranked players, and as the first two well contested games indicated, there was not much of a qualitative difference in their display of style or skill. They brought their full repertoire into play, with the jump smash and other crafty shots winning them points. Eventually Srikanth lifted his game up a notch to take the third game and the match to put his team ahead in the tie. Srikanth blended his powerful smash and soft hand skills to convert the 8-4 lead at the break into a decisive winning score at 15-10. Srikanth won a short rally with a smash to bring an end to the contest. The results: Bengaluru Raptors lead 2-0 vs Delhi Dashers: B. Sai Praneeth bt H.S. Prannoy (T) 15-3, 12,14-15, 15-13; Marcus Ellis and Lauren Smith (T) lost to Maneepong Jongjit and Evgeniya Kosetskaya 3-15, 9-15; K.

Hyderabad escapes with a draw|VIZIANAGARAM|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Hyderabad avoided the ignominy of dismal start to the new year by salvaging a draw against Andhra on the final day of their Ranji Trophy Group B match at the Dr. PVG Raju ACA Sports Complex here on Wednesday. Resuming at 33 for no loss after conceding a massive 231-run lead in the first innings, Hyderabad lost opener Tanmay Agarwal in the 10th over of the morning, bowled by Andhra captain and pacer B. Ayyappa with one that kept low. Later, debutant and southpaw Tilak Varma was bowled by off-spinner Shoaib Mohammad Khan trying to cut a ball which was too close to his body. It was then left to the experienced duo of captain Akshath Reddy and B. Sandeep to do yet another rescue act. They batted with a lot of authority and freedom putting on a crucial 84-run stand for the third wicket. Strangely, Andhra’s pacers preferred short-pitched bowling after the lunch break and wasted about 10 overs against this duo — the batsmen comfortably swayed away from the firing line — instead of making them play every ball. Prolific A well-set Akshath was finally out when his attempted sweep off Shoaib resulted in a top-edge to slip fielder Ricky Bhui, but not before the batsman completed 740 runs this season with two centuries and three fifties. Soon, Sandeep opened up with some flowing drives before he too perished when looking good. He failed to check an intended straight drive and ended up giving a simple return catch to pacer Girinath Reddy. Andhra’s hopes of a possible win were ignited when all-rounder T. Ravi Teja was gobbled up by wicket-keeper Surya Bharat off left-arm pacer Prithvi Raj to reduce Hyderabad to 210 for five in 69.5 overs. But, Himalay Agarwal scored his fifth half-century of the season to ensure that the match ended in a draw. Hyderabad finished the league with 17 points.

Pankaj breaches the 400-mark|Chennai|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|There has not been a more consistent fast bowler in Indian domestic circuit over the last decade than Pankaj Singh. The former Rajasthan pacer has, year-on-year, delivered the goods for his side. For the current, the senior pro moved out of Rajasthan to join new entrant Puducherry and, on Sunday, finished with another eight-wicket haul as his side posted an easy 10-wicket win over Manipur in the Ranji Trophy. But more importantly, when he picked his first wicket in Manipur’s second innings, the 33-year-old crossed yet another landmark in domestic cricket becoming the first fast-bowler and 10th overall to pick 400 wickets in the National championship. Feels great Speaking toThe Hinduon Wednesday, Pankaj Singh said, “It feels great to go past 400 wickets in Ranji Trophy. It is quite a big landmark because, for a fast bowler to achieve it is a special thing.” Pankaj Singh, who played in two Tests for India against England in 2014 added, “When I started playing, I never thought I would be able to do this. But in the last two years, I was aware this record was a possibility and I am fortunate to get to this mark.” With chances of a India comeback slim, the 33-year-old pacer, who was part of two Ranji-winning campaigns with Rajasthan, said, he did not want to block the chance of a youngster as one of the reasons behind his move to Puducherry.  “More importantly, moving here gives me a chance to mentor some young fast bowlers and bring up a team.” When asked what keeps him going, the pacer said, “I just love playing cricket and I want to be the best when I step on a field. More importantly, I want to leave on a high playing at my best, and as long as I feel I can do well, I will play.” Pankaj’s debut in Southampton was a forgetful one as he returned wicketless but things could have been different had Ravindra Jadeja held on to a catch of Alastair Cook or a close lbw shout against Ian Bell had gone his way. It is something the pacer agrees could have had a different outcome for his national career, but added, “I have no regrets because I fully believe in the fact that you can’t change the past and if you are thinking about it you can’t focus on the present and future.” Speaking about his current team Puducherry, Pankaj Sigh added, “We have a very good professional set-up here, thanks to former CAP secretary P. Damodaren’s efforts. If we continue to go in the right way, in three to five years, Puducherry can compete with established teams.”|0|
Pink Test to raise funds for breast cancer awareness|Sydney|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The fourth Test between Australia and India is expected to raise a record-breaking $2,100,000 to support 15 nurses specialising in breast care services for a year. A joint initiative by the McGrath Foundation and Cricket Australia, the campaign hopes to promote breast cancer awareness. The foundation’s co-founder and president, bowling legend Glenn McGrath, presented the Australian men’s Test team with their pink caps for the official team photo at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Wednesday. Over the last decade, the Sydney Pink Test has become a national phenomenon and is the largest sporting fund-raising initiative in Australia.  Mr. McGrath said: “With 50 Australians diagnosed with breast cancer every day, there is critical and continuing need for more McGrath Breast Care Nurses to support families through breast cancer.”|0|
India’s best pace attack in 50 years, says Kapil|Chennai|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|World Cup-winning India captain Kapil Dev hailed the fast bowlers’ performances in Australia that has given the side its best chance of a series win Down Under. Speaking at a function in Chennai, the legendary all-rounder said, “In the last 50 years no other (Indian) team have done so well in pace bowling what this team have done. It is unbelievable.” Kapil Dev added he was impressed by the culture of fast bowling in the country and said it is bound to inspire the next generation of cricketers too. “I have never seen this culture of an Indian fast bowler coming out and playing so hard. It is good to have a change of culture. It is the fruition of the last 15-20 years of hard work. We have set the benchmark very high and now you will find more fast bowlers coming through.” In 2018, the Indian fast bowlers picked up 179 wickets in 14 Tests at an impressive average of 23.7 with Ishant Sharma, Mohammed Shami and Jasprit Bumrah accounting for 136 of those. Kapil also said he had no issues with Virat Kohli’s aggression that has come under criticism. “As long as he is performing on the field, giving good results, it is fine. I judge him based on the performance on the field.”|0|
Divyansh’s big strike raises hopes|NEW DELHI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Divyansh Singh Panwar has been on a big scoring spree in air rife and it was no surprise that he overtook the World record in winning the Lakshya Cup in Mumbai. The 11th standard student from Jaipur, who has been shooting phenomenally well in the National selection trials asserting his dominance across the men’s, juniors’ and youth category, has done the ground work to earn a call in the National squad for the World Cup to be staged at the Dr. Karni Singh Range, Tughlakabad, in February. To put things in perspective, Divyansh’s score of 252.3 in the final in Mumbai was better than the world record of 251.2 set by Alexander Dryagin of Russia in the Changwon World Cup in April 2018. Interestingly, the women’s world record of 252.4 in air rifle is better, and is with Zhao Ruozhu of China who shot the score in the same World Cup in Changwon last year. More importantly, Divyansh has been highly consistent in the qualification phase as well, with scores of 630.3 in Mumbai, apart from 630.4 and 628.8 in the two trials. “I have not done anything different recently. I have focused on the basics and technique,” said Divyansh when contacted. Good chance Right behind the two stalwarts Deepak Kumar and Ravi Kumar who have been consistently representing the country in recent times, Divyansh believes that there is a good chance to win the Olympic quota. “It is possible. I am not thinking about it much. At the moment, I am thinking about the exams next month,” said Divyansh. Shooting will take priority for the young man who has been guided well by coach Deepak Dubey in Delhi and the former Asian champion, Olympic finalist and world record holder Suma Shirur during the national camps. “Suma madam has taught me a lot, and made me technically strong. Deepak sir helps me physically, mentally and technically whenever I train in Delhi,” said Divyansh.|0|
Tamil Nadu posts easy win over Punjab|CHENNAI|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Tamil Nadu endured a bad start, but finished quite well scripting a 27-25, 25-21, 26-24 win in a Group-A men’s match of the senior National volleyball championships at the Nehru Indoor Stadium here on Wednesday. On the other court, defending champion Railways posted an easy 25-13, 25-13, 25-7 win over Haryana in a Group-A women’s tie. The scheduled inauguration began one-and-a-half hours late and by the time the TN-Punjab contest began, it was 8.30 p.m. Both the host and the visitor struggled in the first set primarily because of this reason. Erring often Setter and captain M. Ukrapandian commenced the match by serving one wide. By and large, TN couldn’t quite click as a unit as its attackers and blockers erred often. Universal M. Ashwin Raj was not in his elements, and the team’s main attacker Naveen Raja Jacob couldn’t land his smashes at the right places. Punjab, too was erratic with its blocks, service and attack. Thanks to Lakhbir Singh’s attack in large measure, Punjab managed to stay in the game. Towards the end of the first set, it was neck-and-neck. At 26-25, TN did well thanks to blocker G.R. Vaishnav who did a wonderful job. It was a compact TN side that one witnessed in the second set. Ashwin Raj proved his worth, by blocking and attacking, thereby giving his team valuable points. But it was Vaishnav who was largely consistent throughout. TN took a comfortable 23-17 lead before Punjab won three consecutive points. But a service error by Davinderdeep ensured TN retained the momentum. The third set witnessed a see-saw battle till 16-15, but TN broke free with wonderful blocking by Vaishnav and Manoj. At 25-24, it was Ukrapandian’s block that swung the match TN’s way. The results:  Men: Group-A: TN bt Punjab 27-25, 25-21, 26-24; Group-A: Women: Railways bt Haryana 25-13, 25-13, 25-7. Women: Group-A: Railways bt Haryana 25-13, 25-13, 25-7. Railways women posted an easy 25-13, 25-13, 25-7 win over Haryana Railways women posted an easy 25-13, 25-13, 25-7 win over Haryana|0|

Spurs stay in title contention|Cardiff|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Harry Kane got himself into the record books again as Tottenham Hotspur started 2019 in style outclassing Cardiff City to prevail 3-0 on Tuesday. Kane’s third-minute opening goal is the fifth successive New Year’s Day he has scored in the Premier League, equalling a record held by Andy Cole and Steven Gerrard. Christian Eriksen and Son Heung-Min added further goals as Spurs had the win wrapped up before half-time and reclaimed second place, a point above Manchester City, and six behind leader Liverpool. This performance marked Mauricio Pochettino’s side out as still being live title contender and a stark contrast to the limp way it lost to another promoted side Wolverhampton Wanderers at home on Saturday. It toyed with Cardiff at times, and the third goal killed the game. Cardiff’s poor record against the top teams continued, losing its last 15 Premier League matches against the ‘big six’ sides, conceding 45 goals. Meanwhile, Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino said his players need to be consistent if they are to win the league. “I don’t want to see the table. Of course we are in a good position. We need to be consistent during the whole season,” he toldSky Sports. The result: Cardiff 0 lost to Tottenham Hotspur 3 (Kane 3, Eriksen 12, Son 26).|0|

‘We will play with full intensity, effort’|Sydney|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|When Virat Kohli took over Test captaincy from M.S. Dhoni it was at the SCG in 2015. The series was already lost, only pride remained to be salvaged. Now he returns to the same venue with India having a wonderful chance to win a Test series in Australia for the first time. The wheel has come a full circle. No pressure Looking calm and relaxed, Kohli said here, on Wednesday, that the thought of a series win was not putting pressure on him. “What is going to come is not something you need to think about. We need to stay in the present and focus on the things we can do. The controllables, we need to figure out what they are. We will play with full intensity and effort.” The Indian captain said, “If the series win happens, it’s great because I have come here the third time on a Test tour and I know how difficult it is to win here.” He said the team was motivated and there was nothing to tell his players. “There is nothing to be said at all because you sense energy in the change room, the guys just want to step out on the field. Everyone is very very focused.” On the pitch here, Kohli said, “On this ground, from what we have seen in the past, the pitch is good for batting for the first two or three days and after that reverse-swing and spin come into play.” Obsessed to win abroad Dwelling on his obsession to win abroad, Kohli said, “The reason I said it has to be an obsession to win away from home is because you cannot afford to be negative even for a single minute, a single day on tour. You need to be that convinced about your ability to come up with a match-winning performance.” Asked about R. Ashwin’s constant fitness issues, Kohli replied, “The physio and the trainer have spoken to him in terms of what’s required [from him] in order to get over the injury concerns. He is a vital part of this Test team and we want him to be 100% fit and for a longer period. In his absence, Vihari has bowled beautifully.” Queried how he was coping with his back injury, Kohli said, “On my personal fitness concern, I’ve had disc issues since 2011, it’s nothing new. I’ve been able to manage it because of the physical effort I have put in over the last few years. When you have a back which has disc issues you can only maintain it. That’s why I’m not too bothered by it.”|0|
Mohan Prasath stars for TN on day two|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Left-arm spinner S. Mohan Prasath bowled Tamil Nadu back into the match with a five-wicket haul to help his side restrict Karnataka to 120, thus conceding only a slender 26-run lead on the second day of the Col. C.K. Nayudu match on Wednesday. After bowling out TN for 94 in the first innings, Karnataka failed to capitalise on a good start and succumbed from its overnight score of 94 for three. In its second innings, TN ended the day on 179 for five with S. Radhakrishnan batting on 61 giving TN a lead of 153 runs. The score: Tamil Nadu 94 and 179 for five in 57 overs (K. Mukunth 34, S. Radhakrishnan 61 batting, K. Vishal Vaidhya 32) vs Karnataka 120 in 66.2 overs (Sujith Gowda 31, K.L. Shrijith 51, S. Mohan Prasath five for 21, T. Ajith Kumar three for 35).|0|
Powers of siddhars|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Snakes have always been considered sacred, and there was a siddhar in Tamil Nadu called Paambbati siddhar (paambu - snake). He knew how to catch snakes. Once, when he went to the hill known as Maruda malai, he met a siddhar, who gave him deeksha. Paambaati siddhar wrote many meaningful verses, which stress the importance of detachment, said Malayaman in a discourse. He says snakes are the ear ornaments of Siva and a snake is the umbrella of Vishnu. While talking of the powers of siddhars, he says they can handle the eight important snakes easily. They can convert something substantial to dust, and vice versa. They can bend the sky like a bow. Fire cannot harm siddhars, he says. His songs are full of philosophical lessons and warn of the dangers of being attached to material objects. Will your wealth come to your rescue when Yama arrives, he asks. The mouth that ate delicacies will be full of mud when one dies. Just as a deer craving for water to quench its thirst believes a mirage to be a water source, so do we think that wealth is our refuge. Brahma has made this human body, which has a short life. Just as the bubbles in water are here one minute and gone the next, the human body too is present on this earth for a short span of time. The body is affected by three impurities. Saiva Siddhanta talks about these three impurities (malams)- anavam (ego), kanmam (karma) and mayai (illusion). Even if you bathe in all the sacred rivers of the land, you cannot get rid of these impurities. You may wash a fish many times, but it still retains its smell. Likewise, the three impurities too are an essential part of the body. Pambaati Siddhar offers penance as a solution to all ills. He urges people to worship God, and to keep in mind the impermanence of the body.|0|

The Sydney 167 was a turning point: Laxman|Bengaluru|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Before V.V.S. Laxman cemented his place in cricket history with his epic 281 at Kolkata, there was a time when he was in danger of losing his spot in the Indian team. Coming into the second essay of the Sydney Test of the 1999-2000 India-Australia series, Laxman had recorded just 249 runs in his previous 15 innings. Laxman resurrected his career with a brilliant attacking 167 at Sydney — the first of his 17 Test hundreds. India lost the match, but there would be no questions asked about his calibre after that knock. “Sydney and Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) holds a special place in my heart. The 167 was the turning point for me, because I finally gained the confidence that I can do well against the best in the world. “The Australian attack consisted of guys like Glenn McGrath, Shane Warne, Damien Fleming and Brett Lee — who was breathing fire at that time. Before getting that hundred, I felt that I didn’t belong on the international stage,” Laxman said here recently, during an event to promote his book281 And Beyond. Early in his knock, Laxman was struck on the helmet by a nasty bouncer from McGrath. “It woke me up. When you play quality bowlers like McGrath, you are bound to have difficult moments. It is very, very important to forget about the previous ball and focus only on the present,” Laxman said. In awe of Tendulkar Four years later, when the Indian team returned to Sydney, Laxman witnessed a Sachin Tendulkar masterclass. Tendulkar did not play a single cover drive during his 241, as he believed the shot was the cause of his poor run of scores. “Sachin’s self-control was unbelievable. I had the best seat in the house (the two put on 353 runs for the fourth wicket). “Sachin didn’t play the cover drive even to part-time bowlers like Simon Katich, Damien Martyn and Steve Waugh. That shows his mental fortitude. It’s so difficult to keep one shot locked up, because once you reach 100 or 150, you get into the flow and start playing your natural strokes,” Laxman said. Cut above the rest The Australian teams of his era were a cut above the rest, Laxman said. “The Australians I played against were fearless; not once did the thought of losing cross their minds. Even when they were in a gloomy match-situation, they would make us feel like they were on top. The current Australian team cannot match them in terms of quality and fearless mindset,” Laxman said.|0|

Frenchwoman’s ‘oldest’ title may be a fraud|Moscow|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|A record held by a Frenchwoman as the world’s longest living person could be fraudulent and involve an identity swap, Russian researchers have claimed in a report that has sparked widespread controversy. Jeanne Calment died at the age of 122 years and 164 days in 1997, setting a record as the world’s most long-lived person that is still unsurpassed. The elderly woman used to joke that God must have forgotten about her. But Russian mathematician Nikolai Zak is not convinced by her story. In collaboration with gerontologist Valery Novoselov, he spent months analysing biographies of Jeanne Calment as well as her interviews and photos, witness testimony and the public records of the city of Arles in southern France where she lived. “Analysing all these materials led me to conclude that Jeanne Calment’s daughter Yvonne assumed her mother’s identity,” said Mr. Zak.|0|

Barbie will soon be 60, and still going strong|El Segundo|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|She is turning 60 this year and still doesn’t have a single wrinkle. Blonde or brunette, slender or curvy, black or white, princess or president, Barbie is a forever favourite for young girls, even if she has caused controversy over the years. The iconic doll has evolved to keep up with the times. And despite fierce competition in the toy industry, 58 million Barbies are sold each year in more than 150 countries. “In an industry where success today is three to five years, 60 years is a huge deal!” said Nathan Baynard, director of global brand marketing for Barbie. Around the world, Barbie is as universally known as Coca-Cola or McDonald’s, Mr. Baynard said during a recent visit to Mattel’s design studio in El Segundo, a suburb of Los Angeles. In all, more than one billion Barbie dolls have been sold since she made her debut at the American Toy Fair in New York on March 9, 1959. She was invented by Ruth Handler, the co-founder of Mattel, who was inspired by her own children to create the doll. “Her daughter Barbara was limited in the choices of her toys — the only ones were baby dolls,” Mr. Baynard recounted. “The only role she could imagine through that play was caregiver, mother,” whereas Ms. Handler’s son “could imagine being an astronaut, cowboy, pilot, surgeon.” Barbie is, of course, a shortened version of Barbara. The doll was supposed to teach girls “that they had choices, that they could be anything. In 1959, it was a radical idea!” Mr. Baynard said. Barbie was an instant success. In the first year, 3,00,000 dolls were sold, he added. From the start, Barbie’s pin-up measurements didn’t immediately seem all that feminist, and would spark criticism for decades to come. “In 1959, her body structure was exaggerated to match the aesthetics of the time and the fabric available,” said Barbie designer Carlyle Nuera. Keeping with the times Since the blonde beauty first hit stores, and after a torrent of complaints over what was seen as unrealistic proportions, Mattel has made many changes — introducing multiple body types and dozens of skin tones. In 1965, four years before Neil Armstrong walked on the Moon, Barbie became an astronaut. In 1968, the first black Barbie doll, a friend named Christie, hit store shelves. Lisa McKnight, senior vice-president and global general manager for the Barbie brand, said that today, 55% of the dolls sold around the world have neither blonde hair nor blue eyes. Mattel has more than 100 people working in the El Segundo design studio, a massive hangar-like building wedged between Los Angeles International Airport and a freeway. Designers begin with a simple sketch. From there on, every bit of a prototype is made by an army of experts — from sculpting the doll using state-of-the-art software and 3D printing to painting the face, styling the hair, choosing fabrics and crafting the clothing patterns. The entire design process for a new Barbie can last 12 to 18 months. Then, the prototype is sent from the California workshop to factories in China and Indonesia for mass production.|0|
Film hunts for beauty in trash|Guwahati|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Indian Revenue Service officer Satyakam Dutta found ‘beauty’ in trash to make a mockumentary — a satirical documentary — that struck gold at an international short film festival last month. What gave his film the edge were a couple of photographers who wanted some “adventure” beyond wedding assignments.Finding Beauty in Garbage, with a running time of seven minutes and 19 seconds, was released on YouTube on Tuesday. Filmmaking was far from Mr. Dutta’s mind when he was transferred three years ago from Nagpur as the Deputy Director of Income Tax (Investigation) in eastern Assam’s Dibrugarh, about a two-hour drive from his home in Dhemaji via the Bogibeel Bridge across river Brahmaputra. But random garbage dumps across the town, the administrative and commercial hub during British rule and a major Second World War military base, made him wonder whether people found littered streets beautiful. The idea turned into a script 18 months ago. He found in Partha Bhuyan and Chandan Kakoty who volunteered to execute the idea on film. “They were assigned to photograph my wedding in October 2016. They offered to work without any fee because they wanted a break from the monotony and hoped to earn some name,” Mr. Dutta, 35, toldThe Hinduon Wednesday. On a budget Mr. Dutta and the photographer duo took time off their routine work to document the ever-expanding dumpsites. They shot with SLR cameras and mobile phones. “After shooting physically and with drones, the search for a good narrator took me to a freelancing website to which I paid $26.25 for the voiceover by a man who identified himself as jovialduality,” Mr. Dutta said. The audio file delivered by the website was mixed during the editing of the video. The final product turned out to be much better than Mr. Dutta had imagined. “I decided to send it for short film festivals around the world, and won the gold medal in the very first — the South East Asia Short Film Festival in Cambodia – I participated in,” he said. The IRS officer is undecided about making another film. “I hope it would be a documentary, not a mockumentary, on finding the charm of Dibrugarh,” he said.|0|
I ndia may have welcomed maximum newborns on January 1|New Delhi|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST| India is estimated to have welcomed 18% of the total babies born globally on January 1, 2019, UNICEF said on Tuesday. As per UNICEF, 69,944 babies were expected to be born on the New Year Day out of 3,95,072 babies likely to be born across the world. As per UNICEF, globally over half of these births are estimated to have taken place in seven countries, along with India like China (44,940), Nigeria (25,685), Pakistan (15,112), Indonesia (13,256), the U.S. (11,086), DR Congo (10,053), and Bangladesh (8,428). Sydney was set to greet an estimated 168 babies, followed by Tokyo (310), Beijing (605), Madrid (166) and finally, New York (317). Fiji in the Pacific was likely to deliver 2019’s first baby and the U.S. its last. “This New Year Day, let’s all make a resolution to fulfil every right of every girl and boy, starting with the right to survive. We can save millions of babies if we invest in training and equipping local health workers so that every newborn is born into a safe pair of hands,” said Yasmin Ali Haque, UNICEF India Representative, said.IANS|0|

The National Park in Greenland|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST| On the world’s largest island is located the world’s largest national park. The National Park in Greenland spans more than nine-and-a-half lakh sq.km., which is, in fact, larger than several countries in the world! Also the northernmost national park in the world, it was set up in 1974 to govern this uninhabited region. It remains uninhabited to this day and has no permanent residents. While the place is visited only by researchers and scientists, sealers and whalers have regular access to the region. Offering spectacular scenery, this Park is significant as a biosphere reserve for a variety of tundra vegetation and wildlife. The region is said to have a very high concentration of musk ox, close to about half the world’s population.  While a majority of the birds here are migratory, the Park nurtures more than 50 species of permanent breeders. The birds that can be spotted here include geese, eiders, ducks, divers, fulmars, cormorants, plovers, sandpipers, razorbills, puffins, skuas, gulls, terns, eagles, falcons, doves, ptarmigans, black ravens, snow buntings, pipits and wheatears. The animals roaming the region include polar bears, seals, grey wolves, Arctic hares, Arctic foxes, caribou, walruses and musk oxen.   •The two subspecies of walrus are Atlantic and Pacific walruses. •These fin-footed, semi-aquatic marine mammals can grow up to 11 ft and weigh more than one tonne. •Despite their huge size, these carnivores are very social animals and usually not aggressive. They normally feed on shellfish, but when food is scarce, they may make do with dead seals. •The tusks sticking out on the sides of their mouth are actually the animals’ canine teeth. These teeth help the animals in several ways, including to break the ice and defend themselves from predators. Their thick skin helps them keep warm. •Due to overhunting a couple of centuries ago for tusks, oil, skin and meat, their numbers had dwindled drastically. Today the population is said to be declining primarily due to climate change.|0|
South Korea counting on red-hot Son to shine on Asian Cup quest|Abu Dhabi|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|South Korea are hoping Son Heung-min's dazzling pace and goals can help them end a 59-year wait to be crowned continental kings as the newly expanded Asian Cup starts at the weekend. Holders Australia, four-time winners Japan, Carlos Queiroz's Iran and hosts the United Arab Emirates are all formidable opponents, but none will relish facing Paulo Bento's Koreans. The 2015 runners-up have put their stamp on the international scene in recent times, stunning holders Germany at last year's World Cup before winning the Asian Games football tournament in September. Son, 26, was at the heart of both successes and his delight was plain to see at the Asian Games in Indonesia, where victory earned the team an exemption from South Korea's compulsory, 21-month military service. The Tottenham Hotspur forward, who has a deadly shot with either foot, has been in scorching form for his club. But he will sit out South Korea's first two games next week under a deal with his club in return for his release for last year's Asian Games. Son, the most prolific Asian in Premier League history, will hope South Korea get the job done against the Philippines and Kyrgyzstan before he jets in for their final Group C clash against China on January 16. The Koreans, edged 2-1 by Australia after the 2015 final went to extra time, haven't won the Asian Cup since 1960. Arnold's predicament Japan are among their chief rivals in UAE, after they were the only Asian side to reach the World Cup knock-outs before narrowly going down to Belgium in the last 16. Australia, however, seem to have gone backwards since they lifted the trophy in Sydney in 2015, and it's a tall order for new coach Graham Arnold who is plunged into the title defence just four games into the job. Dark horses and VAR Among many sub-plots, China's stuttering attempts to become a football power will come under scrutiny, in what looks set to be Marcello Lippi's last outing as coach, while India get a rare chance to impress at the region's top level. One wild-card looks set to be the introduction of video assistant referees (VAR) from the quarter-finals, which could raise the likelihood of penalties after playing a role in the record number given at last year's World Cup.

Record-equalling Kane keeps Spurs in title hunt|Cardiff|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Harry Kane got himself into the record books again as Tottenham Hotspur started 2019 in style outclassing Cardiff City to prevail 3-0 on Tuesday. Kane's third-minute opening goal is the fifth successive New Year's Day he has scored in the Premier League, equalling a record held by Andy Cole and Steven Gerrard. Christian Eriksen and Son Heung-Min added further goals as Spurs had the win wrapped up before half-time and reclaimed second place, a point above Manchester City, and six behind leaders Liverpool, before those two sides lock horns on Thursday. This performance marked Mauricio Pochettino's side out as still being live title contenders and a stark contrast to the limp way they lost to another promoted side Wolverhampton Wanderers at home on Saturday. Cardiff’s poor record They toyed with Cardiff at times, and the third goal killed the game. Cardiff's poor record against the top teams continued, losing their last 15 Premier League matches against the 'big six' sides, conceding 45 goals. The Bluebirds had picked up four points from their last two games and recorded back-to-back clean sheets after leaking five to Manchester United in their previous home game, but any hopes of making it three quickly disappeared. Kane's goal came off his shin, deflecting in a loose ball from a terrible touch from Cardiff captain Sean Morrison after Kieran Trippier's cross from the right initially hit the England captain. Spurs made it 2-0 after just 12 minutes with a classy goal from Eriksen. The Danish midfielder bought himself time and space by dummying Bruno Ecuele Manga and Harry Arter before picking his spot from the edge of the box to top off an impressive move involving Moussa Sissoko and Son. Son made it 3-0 with another stylish finish, the South Korean delaying his shot from Kane's short pass while Morrison dallied before steering an acute-angled drive across Neil Etheridge and into the far bottom corner for his 11th goal of the season, all scored in the last 16 games. Arsenal beats Fulham 4-1 Arsenal manager Unai Emery was happy with his team's attacking play after Tuesday's 4-1 victory over Fulham but admitted their defending has plenty of room for improvement. “Our challenge now is to improve defensively,” Emery admitted. “We are very happy with the attacking players, scoring lots of goals like today. “But we need more balance defensively.” Elsewhere, Jamie Vardy rescued a dire match with an eye-catching celebration as his goal secured Leicester City a 1-0 win away at Everton.

Before an earthquake strikes|Roorkee:|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Scientists at IIT Roorkee claim to have developed an earthquake early warning system that can alert people up to a minute before the quake strikes. The system, already deployed in some areas of Uttarakhand, consists of a network of sensors that detect different types of seismic waves travelling through the layers of the Earth after a quake. “Current techniques of earthquake prediction do not really work. People try to predict it using statistical methods, but none of the methods known yet are accurate enough,” Mukat Lal Sharma, a professor at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee, told PTI. However, the earthquake early warning system can give people a lead time ranging from 10 seconds to a minute. Sharma said that for a quake originating due to tectonic plate movements in the Himalayan region, people in Dehradun will get a warning 11 seconds before the tremors, while those in New Delhi will have a longer lead time of about a minute. While this may not be enough to completely evacuate buildings, such warnings can at least allow people to take cover and protect themselves from fatal injuries, Sharma said on the sidelines of the 16th Symposium of Earthquake Engineering held at IIT Roorkee. Other precautions like switching off nuclear power plants, stopping metro trains, and cutting off gas supply etc, can be taken care of with a minute’s warning. “We can not save buildings, but perhaps we can save a few more lives,” Sharma said. “We have deployed over 100 sensors -- between Uttarkashi and Chamoli districts of Uttarakhand -- which send real time data from various stations to our lab. We are analysing these data in real time and separating the data related to earthquake magnitude,” Sharma said. “The earthquake warning system will be activated if the tremor has a magnitude of more than 6,” he said. After conducting the research with the sensors for over two years in Uttarakhand, a system of sirens too have been deployed in the area last year that can alert people up to 200 metres away.    Since no major earthquake has yet affected the region since the warning system was deployed, it is not clear how beneficial it will be in a real disaster scenario. More time is needed to ascertain the system’s effectiveness.PTI|0|
Charging Liverpool challenge Man City to prove their greatness|Manchester|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|“I start to read and then I start to think 'Liverpool and Jurgen Klopp' and I cannot focus,” said Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola last month, admitting Liverpool's charge to depose the Premier League champions has been in his head for some time. But in their very first game of 2019, City already find themselves in must-win territory to haul Liverpool back into view by inflicting the leaders' first defeat of the season and cutting a seven-point lead to four at the Etihad on Thursday. ‘If we drop points then it is over’ “With the position of Liverpool, if we drop points then it is over, it is finished; it would be almost impossible,” said Guardiola after Sunday's 3-1 win at Southampton. Guardiola's obsession with Liverpool and Klopp in particular is not surprising. For a serial winner, no side and no manager has caused the Catalan as many problems as the German. City have won just one of seven meetings since Guardiola joined Klopp in England after locking horns in charge of Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund. A shock run of three defeats in four Premier League games in December has left City playing catch up to a Liverpool side eyeing history by ending a 29-year wait to win the league. But even when seemingly no one else could stop City as they stormed to the title with a record 100 points last season, Klopp's men were a constant menace. However, the City boss has also been keen to reiterate just how good his own side are, despite their recent blip. Consistent success is the mark of a truly great side and if City should reel in a Liverpool side seemingly hell bent on making history, that is a tag they will deserve. AFP|0|
Is your screen taking over your life?|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|What is the most common gesture of your daily life? Think about it! It’s most likely, the act of reaching for your mobile phone and glancing at the screen. Whether you’re waiting in a queue or stuck in traffic, or sometimes even if you are occupied in another activity such as eating, watching a movie or talking to someone, it’s more or less automatic – reaching beside you for the phone, and playing a game on it or scrolling through social media. Technology dominates nearly every aspect of our lives, and for the most part, it’s useful and educational. But perhaps sometimes, could it be too much? Recently, the World Health Organisation included ‘gaming disorder’ in its International Classification of Diseases. And while studies suggest that it affects only a small proportion of people who play digital or video games, the WHO says that people who do play games, should be alert to the amount of time they spend – especially if it is to the “exclusion of other daily activities.” What happens to people who have a gaming disorder? It could seriously affect their life and aspects of their health – such as not getting enough physical exercise and sleep, their diet could be poor and it could affect their mental health too. Some countries have even tried to establish laws that restrict children from online gaming during certain hours and many, including India, have clinics to treat these disorders. So does this mean all screen time is bad? Not at all. Going online can help with learning, with keeping in touch with friends and exploring personal interests – things that were done offline before, and are done online now. The key is to ensure that screen use – whether on social media, gaming or otherwise, does not become problematic. Our impulse is generally to keep scrolling or playing, and it can be so very tempting especially if the alternative is a little boring – but if it’s now more of an effort to read a book than it was before, or if your screen time is affecting study time or football time, it’s probably best to put your device away, at least for a little while.|0|

Showcasing Australia to the world|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST| The Royal Exhibition Building and Carlton Gardens is a World Heritage Site located in Melbourne, Australia. The building and the surrounding gardens were designed by Joseph Reed to host two major international exhibitions, one in 1880 and the other in 1888. It follows a style similar to other buildings erected around the world as part of the International Exhibition Movement. The site comprises two Crown Land Reserves for Public Recreation (Carlton Gardens) and one dedicated to the exhibition building and the recently-constructed Melbourne Museum (Exhibition Reserve). The inscribed property is a 26-hectare rectangular block surrounded by four city streets and an additional 55.26 hectares in the surrounding buffer zone. The building and the surrounding gardens were declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2004.|0|
Studious and sidelined|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|I seem to have an unusual problem. I am often teased in my class for my good academic performance. They call me a nerd. Every time the teacher asks a question, all eyes are on me. Some even snigger and call me a walking encyclopaedia. Sometimes I even perform badly in my examinations just so I can be a part of the fun-loving groups. How do I make my friends realise that being good at academics comes naturally to me and that I want to be a part of what they do? Honestly, this is sad. I would like to tell you that the kids making fun of you are doing so as they are not half as smart as you are - in simpler terms, they are jealous of you. Apart from being good at your studies, maybe you can try and connect with them over a hobby or a sport or something else so they know there’s a fun side to you. But whatever you do, do not lower your standards of academic excellence to fit in. I always find that questions are too short while the answers are way too long. They seem to be never ending, and all points seem to be important. How do I remember these long answers? Here’s a simple way of doing it. This is a great memory tool. All you need to do is put the key words together, and weave a story around it. For example, let’s assume you need to learn the factors that affect the climate of a place, namely a. Altitude; b. Latitudinal location; c. Distance from the sea; d. Ocean Currents; and e. Winds. Let’s use these key words and make a story around it. Like this: Simone was a happy person. But when she went to high ALTITUDES, she felt dizzy. She realised that the LATITUDINAL LOCATION of her house was a short DISTANCE FROM THE SEA. Naturally, she relied on OCEAN CURRENTS and WINDS for fresh air, so she could feel better. Now, instead of remembering the various points in isolation, it will be easier to remember them through this story. I have bad bouts of acne from time to time. It makes me feel very conscious, and I don’t even like to attend any social gatherings. I always have a feeling everyone is looking at my acne while talking to me. Help! Well, looks have become an integral part of how we feel about ourselves. Funnily, this is not something that weighs heavily on just teens’ minds but also on those of adults. However, there is only one thing, just ONE thing that you need to keep in mind. Just as you are conscious about the way you are being judged, so is the person speaking to you. So wear a smile with confidence – no one in this world is perfect. This is true for not just acne, but with any aspect of looks that leaves you worried. Do learn to love the way you look and feel about yourself. The minute you love yourself and respect your body, everyone else around you will do just the same. I seem to be nervous pretty often these days. Sometimes it is a loud noise, sometimes it is the darkness, sometimes it is the fear of being alone. I jump at the sound of anyone speaking to me from behind. Sometimes I also feel there is someone watching me from the corner. Is this normal? Smile. Take a deep breath. Ask yourself if you have been reading too many horror or ghost stories. Or if you have been watching some stuff on television that could be causing this nervousness. It seems to be a figment of your imagination. However, the easiest and the best way to handle fear is to face it. So, the next time you are feeling nervous or scared, ask yourself how justified it is to feel that way. Is there any reason for you to feel that way? Ask a parent or any other adult to be with you when you feel this way. Often breaking down the fear with some logic helps bring it down.

Paine targets long-term improvement|Sydney|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Australia captain Tim Paine insisted on Wednesday that his priority was to develop his inexperienced cricket team for the future even as they face the prospect of losing a home series against India for the first time. But he pledged that Australia would still pick the “best XI that we think is the best combination to win this Test” once they had seen the Sydney pitch. Australia, who have never lost a home series against India, go into Thursday's fourth Test 2-1 down and in danger of Virat Kohli's men completing a historic landmark Down Under. While Australia must win to level the series, Paine said that his aim was on improvement, particularly in the batting department, with home Tests to come against Sri Lanka ahead of an Ashes tour to England this year. “It doesn't for me personally,” he said on whether preventing an India series win was his key motivation. ‘Playing the best possible cricket’  “Other guys may use it but my focus has been on us improving and on us playing the best possible cricket that we can and when we haven't, making sure we learn from it.” The hosts' top order has largely failed to fire and the odds are mounting that the under-performing Aaron Finch will either be pushed down or axed, with number three Usman Khawaja moving up to open alongside Marcus Harris. “If that's the way we go, Usman will go out and give his all as he always does. I think the way he's handled the last month or so has been exemplary, it's a real credit to him,” said Paine. The captain said he wanted a final look at the wicket before selecting the team from the 14-man squad. “It's just team balance really,” he said. AFP|0|
Leonard's 45 points fuel Raptors over Jazz, Bucks win|Los Angeles|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Kawhi Leonard poured in a career-high 45 points to lead the Toronto Raptors to a 122-116 NBA victory over the Utah Jazz on Tuesday. With the win the Raptors improved to 28-11, keeping the pressure on the Milwaukee Bucks who boosted their league-leading record in terms of winning percentage to 26-10 with a 121-98 victory over Detroit. The Raptors were again without injured Jonas Valanciunas and Kyle Lowry – whose return date remains uncertain after he received anti-inflammatory injections to combat back pain last week. In their absence, Leonard excelled, making all seven of his field goal attempts in the third quarter as he scored 19 points in the period and the Raptors – who trailed by two at half-time – pulled away. Pascal Siakam contributed a career-best 28 points with 10 rebounds for the Raptors and Norman Powell added 14 points off the bench as Toronto improved to 28-11. In Milwaukee, the Bucks won their fourth straight with the help of 25 points from Brook Lopez, 22 from Khris Middleton and 18 from Eric Bledsoe. “I was feeling good,” Lopez said. “We were moving the ball really well ... my guys were making great passes to me all night.” Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo had a relatively modest 15 points, but they included a stunning one-handed dunk over Jon Leuer in the final minute of the first quarter.

In full bloom|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|When Sunil Kumar and Anila V visited a plant nursery in 2007, one flowering species caught their attention. Finding its asking price “too high”, the couple, however, returned home empty-handed. But the passionate gardeners found their thoughts going back to the “forbidden fruit” and soon yielded to temptation, thus buying their first Adenium Obesum. “Unlike other plants we have grown, we found that Adenium or Desert Rose has a unique charm. With its unusual caudex (swollen base), the fascinating shapes the plant can develop into was a great attraction. Slowly, we started buying more Adenium varieties from various nurseries around and the search extended across the country when it became an obsession,” says Sunil. Clearly, their endeavour has come up roses. Today, the couple has virtually converted the terrace of their white-walled, one-storey house in Kazhakkoottam into a blooming nursery of Adeniums of all kinds. They also maintain a large poly-house of the plant at Anila’s place in Ayoor, Kollam district. Propagated mostly through grafting, their collection boasts over 120 flowering varieties, when both original and hybrid ones are taken into account.  Peak efflorescence “The motto for Adeniums is: less water, more sunlight. Don’t love them a lot by watering daily. When you water them, do it thoroughly and wait for the medium (soil) to be completely dry before the next turn,” advises Sunil. The couple recollect coming back from vacations to find some of their other plants wilted while the Adeniums welcomed them with plenty of flowers. Unsurprisingly, Adeniums here shed their blossom during monsoon and reach peak efflorescence during the period from January to May in line with the State’s climatic conditions. With its origins in the Arabian Peninsula, the Adenium genus seems to have found its way into the South-East Asian culture for its colourful appeal. “It’s not really a fragrant species but is extremely flexible, both in terms of growing as well as floral varieties. Through grafting, virtually a large number of petal shades can be developed. In some countries, such as Taiwan, Thailand and some part of China, Adeniums holds a certain degree of sacredness, just like our thulasi,” says Sunil, who runs an outlet in Pangappara that exclusively sells Adeniums, cacti and succulents. Original Adeniums bear pink flowers and are commonly used as “rootstocks” during grafting, where a small stem portion of a hybrid is cut and attached to the rootstock, which is then kept in the shade until growth from the new stem is spotted. Hybrid varieties can come in single petals or multi petals and the flowers take a wide range of shades like red, blackish red, white, yellow, purple or striped ones. However, what colour and form a hybrid variety takes can only be confirmed after it blossoms. Sunil, thus, advises a prospective Adenium growers to never buy seedlings without seeing the parent flower first. Trained into shapes One distinctive feature of Adeniums is that they can be grown into desired shapes by “training.” Like, Adenium Arabicum, a pliable variety that develops a beautiful canopy in bonsai form. It can be meticulously root-trained into ‘tower form’ with elongated trunks. “Usually, bonsais are grown by way of slow and controlled growth. Arabicums are natural bonsais and hence grow relatively quicker in amusing shapes,” points out Anila, a techie. Another hot favourite with Adenium aficionados for bonsai is Thai Socotranum, which has abundant branching. The most common variety, Adenium Obesum, however, requires pruning. Nevertheless, maintenance is no bed of roses. Sunil has sourced varieties of saplings from as far as Thailand. “Bare-rooted ones can be shipped and they won’t die like most other plants,” he says. The couple’s hobby extends beyond the Adeniums, evident from the array of succulents, agaves, aloe hybrids and some rare cacti specimens such as Astrophytum (Living rock), Gymnocalcium, Mammillaria varieties and Echinocactus surrounding their house. In fact, some of the adeniums and cacti that have adorned flower shows in the city came straight from Sunil’s gardens. Price starts from Rs. 250 for Adenium Obesum and Rs. 350 for Arabicum. Arabicum Thai Socotranum, perhaps the rarest in Sunil’s collection, comes at Rs. 20,000.Contact: 9946201969  Know the difference Sunil says while the most common variety, Adenium Obesum, is a “lovers’ choice” for the exquisite flowers they produce, Arabicum is a “bonsai lovers’ choice.” While hundreds of hybrids and flower varieties can be developed using Obesum, Arabicum usually produces only a kind of pink flower in varying sizes depending on the variety   Dos and don’ts  The medium (soil) used should be porous and ideally comprise 40% of river sand, 40% organic manure or vermicompost and 20% red earth or cocopeat. Adeniums cannot tolerate water-logging. It is usually a pot plant and is grown as bonsai. However, a proper growing medium or a hilly landscape may help if one wants to plant them on the ground, explains Sunil. The caudex fattens over time as the plant grows and may require re-potting into a larger one accordingly. Regular inspection is of paramount importance as pests such as mealybugs and spider mites can attack the plants. Sunil recommends that the leaves must ideally be kept as clean as much possible to prevent pest attacks.

Paine wants public to give Smith, Warner another chance|Sydney|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Test skipper Tim Paine on Wednesday urged Australia's public to give the disgraced Steve Smith and David Warner a second chance, saying he hoped “they're welcomed back” into the national team. The pair's year-long ban for ball-tampering is due to expire at the end of March and they are widely expected to be rushed back into a side that has struggled without them.

We have 50-50 chance of making it to second round: Bhutia|New Delhi:|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Former captain Bhaichung Bhutia says India have a 50-50 chance of making it to the second round of the upcoming AFC Asian Cup. With Sunil Chhetri at the helm, Bhutia was asked about India’s chances in the tournament. “I feel it’s a good group to be in – with Thailand, UAE and Bahrain. I think we have a 50-50 chance of making it to the second round,” the 42-year-old Bhutia said. “It will all depend on the hard work the boys put in, and a little bit of luck. I urge the team to give their all, and leave no stone unturned. They should enjoy the atmosphere of being part of such a big tournament,” he was quoted as saying by the All India Football Federation’s official website. Asked about the significance of the Asian Cup, Bhutia said, “It’s obviously great that you get to share space and hotels with some of the greatest players in Asia and world football. “As a player, you dream about playing against such opposition. These are the moments we footballers live for as the entire continent, and even the world is watching you.” PTI|0|

Unearth jewels from a treasury|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST| Nature can be baffling, and how! In Loktak lake, you can stand on a piece of land that floats on water. Go boating in the largest freshwater lake in the Northeast and you will come across several floating swamps which are heterogeneous masses of vegetation, soil and organic matter. In the south-western part of the lake is located Keibul Lamjao National Park, probably the world’s largest floating park, which was declared a national park in 1977. If you are lucky you might get a glimpse of the reclusive Sangai here, the endangered brow-antlered deer, also the State animal of Manipur. The Sangai is also called the dancing deer because when it moves on the floating park, it appears to dance on the waters. The construction of the Ithai Barrage for the Loktak Hydro Electric Project, has altered the ecology of the lake. Designated as the Ramsar Wetland of International Importance, the lake is home to diverse flora and fauna, such as several species of aquatic plants, birds, and animals, including the Indian python. The lake is a lifeline for Manipur, especially for its fishermen.|0|
A few good tunes|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The quality of Bollywood music continued on a downward spiral in 2018 but the multi-composer soundtracks and remixes kept going north. In fact, this was the year that even biggies like A.R. Rahman and Amit Trivedi got sucked into the multi-composer vortex. One little silver lining, though, has been the ease in compiling the top songs for the year. However, if not for some soundtracks bolstering the scene in the second half of 2018 even a reasonable number of picks would have been difficult to make. Here are the 18 that stood out in 2018. Hallaa (Manmarziyaan) Composer Amit Trivedi’s busiest year to date was also a rather middling one for most part, until he reunited with the man who gave him his first break, Anurag Kashyap. While the characteritsic repetitiveness of Trivedi was a problem here too, there was more than enough great music on offer.‘Halla’,written by Shellee, is my pick for the pulsating orchestration, Jyoti Nooran’s rendition and alsofor the moment in the movie when the song appears. Dilbaro (Raazi) The most popular song fromRaaziand quite deservedly so; SEL and Gulzar build a beautiful“bidaai”song around a traditional Kashmiri wedding piece. Harshdeep Kaur takes care of the rest, with brief but effective cameos from Vibha Saraf and Shankar Mahadevan. Bol Ke Lab (Manto) The most exciting aspect about the Nandita Das film, at least to me, was the return of Sneha Khanwalkar, that too in style. In this song, Faiz’s powerful poetry gets a raag yaman-flavoured melody from the composer. She has two classical exponents — Rashid Khan and Vidya Shah — singing it and adorns it with a rich backdrop of strings, harmonium and clarinets. Aaj Se Teri (Pad Man) Among singers, Arijit Singh had the best year; as if in contradicting the (misplaced) criticism that he sings the same kind of songs. My favourite from the Arijit range is this beauty by Amit Trivedi and Kausar Munir, based on raag bhimplaasi that the composer has employed well in the past too. Naino Waale Ne (Padmaavat) One of the best things about Sanjay Leela Bhansali movies is the visual representation of songs. It was surprising therefore that the best song ofPadmaavatnever even made it to the screen. Neeti Mohan leads this lovely melody that takes on the occasional wistful tone with the raag darbari Kanada flavoured cues on sitar. Bohot Dukha Mann (Mukkabaaz) Composer Rachita Arora, who showed promise in her debut last year (Newton), continued to deliver it. In this melancholic classical-flavoured piece written by Hussain Haidry, she doubles up as a singer alongside Dev Arijit, and does a fabulous job at that. Aahista (Laila Majnu) With this soundtrack co-composed with Joi Barua and Alif, sitar exponent Niladri Kumar had everyone wishing he would make more music in Hindi movies. In this song (written by Irshad Kamil, sung by Jonita Gandhi and Arijit Singh), Kumar literally takes you on a romantic journey across the Kashmir valley. Dhadak (Dhadak) The problem with remakes is that you find yourself hard-pressed not to keep comparing them with the original work. Even taking that into account, the title song ofDhadak(remake of Nagraj Manjule’s Marathi hitSairat) holds up admirably. It is hard not to fall in love with Ajay Atul’s lush violins and haunting tune, delivered by Ajay Gogavle and Shreya Ghoshal. Andhadhun (Andhadhun) While Amit Trivedi produced a competent set of songs for Sriram Raghavan inAndhadhun, my favourite still remains the guest composition by Raftaar and Girish Nakod. The piano and percussion-heavy (always a sucker for Marathi percussion!) title song perfectly captures the heady rush of the ride that the movie turns out to be. Grey Walaa Shade (Manmarziyaan) A song that, in addition to introducing the lead pair’s romance onscreen, turns out to be emblematic of the movie itself. It is replete with Amit Trivedi’s trademark quirkiness, further accentuated by the dancing twins that appear in the song’s video. Nagri Nagri (Manto) Shankar Mahadevan delivers this piece that, in keeping with the movie’s setting, carries a melody and a style of rendition that is evocative of the ’40s. Composer Sneha Khanwalkar does, however, by her own admission, get cheeky with the arrangement with some electronic elements finding their way towards the end. That does not in any way take away from the song’s appeal. Chaav Laga (Sui Dhaaga) The team that gave us ‘Moh Moh Ke Dhaage’ (Dum Lagaa Ke Haishaa) two years back reunited inSui Dhaagato deliver another simple yet beautiful piece, the wonderful Ronkini Gupta being the only addition on the vocal front this time. Mere Naam Tu (Zero) While the reviews of the movie have been mixed, what everyone appears to agree on is how well this song has been depicted on screen. An incredible melody backed by Ajay Atul’s trademark sweeping orchestration and a fabulous Bollywood playback debut for Abhay Jodhpurkar. Naina Banjaare (Pataakha) Vishal Bhardwaj-Gulzar soundtrack for the movie was an uncharacteristically short one and not as top notch as their previous albums. In this song the duo gets everything right, with ample help from Arijit of course. A gem that in its light-heartedness takes my mind back to‘Dil Toh Bachcha Hai Ji’fromIshqiya. Mujhe Chaand Pe Le Chalo (Sanju) A.R. Rahman was more active in the South this year, his two songs forSanju’ssix-song soundtrack being the only Bollywood contributions. The shoddy visual treatment the song received might have something to do with it not becoming particularly popular, but there is no denying the brilliance of this dreamy, sensual piece written by Irshad Kamil sung with a fitting verve by Nikhita Gandhi. Raazi (Raazi) SEL have given us a lot of anthemic pieces over time; in Meghna Gulzar’sRaazi, the trio alongside Gulzar and Arijit Singh, channel their soundscape fromMirzyato produce this wonderfully earthy motivational piece.  Ishq Di Baajiyaan(Soorma) Soorma’s music may not sit too well in the combined portfolio of SEL and Gulzar but is still quite an enjoyable one; this folksy piece (where Diljit Dosanjh gets behind the mic) mostly so.  Heartquake (Karwaan) Composer Anurag Saikia’s promising entry into mainstream Bollywood went largely under the radar, possibly because all the movies he has been involved in so far were multi-composer. Two of those came from director Akarsh Khurana, and it is in this light and quirky track written by Khurana himself, that Saikia delivers his best of the year.|0|

Secrets from the caverns|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|It is late afternoon. I am hungry, nursing a headache and contemplating the 400-odd steps I have to climb in order to explore a few caves. Sounds like an idea best abandoned. But I’m a lover of history and am egged on by an archaeologist who is ready to accompany and enlighten us on the treasures inside. We set off to explore the not-so-well- known Bedse caves near Lonavala, Maharashtra and the early Buddhist rock cut caves of Bhaja, Karle and Bedse. Experts believe that before visiting the World Heritage sites of Ajanta and Ellora, one must visit these caves, considered an an introductory chapter to them. These caves on hillocks are more than 2,000 years old and were the residence of monks who used to lived austere lives here. Enveloped in the beauty of Western Ghats, every cave has its own charm and serenity, tailor made for meditation and solitude. Archaeologist Sawani Shetye of the Goa-based Bhoomij Heritage group informs us that thousands of years ago, these caves lay on an ancient trade route, running eastward from the Arabian Sea into the Deccan. Traders used them as shelter on their travels. Our journey started from Pune to the Bhaja caves around 60 kilomterers away. These are touristy but still convey a sense of peace when you visit them. Bhaja, a group of 22 rock-cut caves, is the best example of early Buddhist cave architecture dating back to the 2nd Century BC. The important cave is Cave XII, which has a beautiful wooden ceiling in a horseshoe shape made of Burmese teak more than 2,000 years old. The hall or thechaityagrhahas pillars on both sides and astupaat its centre. A little ahead are a cluster of stupas which are now covered with a roof. These contain relics and were built by the monks in memory of their gurus. However, what set apart these caves are the panels or sculptures on walls. They tell the story of the Sun god and Indra. Look out for the carving of a woman playing something that looks like an early version of the tabla! The latter half of the day was spent in the stunning Karle Caves. These caves developed from the 2nd Century BC to the 5th Century AD. Many traders and Satavahana rulers gave grants for construction of these caves. The Grand Chaitya (Cave VIII) has massive pillars that have figures of males and females, mounted on animals such lions, elephants, etc. It also has a stupa in the centre. A 15-metre high pillar stands at its entrance. A few centuries ago there were two pillars, but now only one survives. There is the Ekvira temple here. No one knows for sure when this temple was constructed, but now it is a major pilgrimage site especially for the Koli community of Maharashtra. Shetye informs us that these caves were situated not far from villages as monks had to visit the village to gather alms. They had little comfort except the spectacular views. The Bedse caves were built during the Satavahana period. Some of the caves appear to have been meditation halls and the acoustics suggest the same. The environment is perfect for meditation what with the monsoon green as far as the eye can see and no other sound except the gurgle of waterfalls and the screams of the peacocks.And, of course, the deafening silence.|0|

Mirroring us|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|All that time spent scrolling through social media posts is taking a toll. For some travellers, vacations don’t matter unless they are in picture-perfect spots that can be shared on social media platforms. Some mimic poses of their favourite celebrities, while a few others scout for similar accommodation. Results of a recent survey show the extent of social media stimulus on vacation and behaviour patterns of Indian travellers. Around 66% of Indian travellers surveyed by Booking.com stated that they see travel as a potential opportunity to earn a living as an influencer or travel blogger. The web portal’s travel predictions for 2019 reveals that social media will continue to impact the way we travel. Insights were gathered from over 163 million verified guest reviews, along with its research encompassing 21,500 travellers across 29 countries (1,000 from India). The results found seven in 10 Indian travellers to be excited about the prospect of space travel in 2019 and beyond, and are open to considering the experience themselves, while three in five travellers say they would rather stay in accommodation under the sea than in space. Further, the survey revealed that 53% of Indian travellers look at where celebrities stay and try to find accommodation that looks similar. In fact, 24% of Indian travellers try to re-create poses from one of their favourite celebs or Instagrammers. Giving in to the pressure of social media gratification, 30% respondents admitted to having posted an older, more flattering image from a previous holiday rather than from their current trip. And 42% have taken a picture of a different accommodation pretending they are staying there. About 63% want to stay in accommodation that will look good on social media, and 22% have pretended to still be on vacation when they are actually at home.|0|
Words of wisdom|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|“These boys are playing ‘blind’ tennis.” The comment, both cryptic and concise, was what one had come to expect from tennis coaching legend, Captain Pavan Murthy, who passed away last month following a brief illness. Over the decades, Bengaluru has been home to some excellent and well-known tennis coaches whose wards have gone on to play tennis at national and international levels. There is little doubt that the doyen among them was Pavan Murthy. Over a full life of 78 years, Pavan lived and worked across three continents sharing his vast knowledge and passion for the game to those who sought his advice. In his untimely demise, the tennis world has lost an astute analyst of the game. Pavan Murthy was a commercial pilot based in Bahrain, but his tennis talent saw him emerge as a top player in the Middle East. A four-time Rothman’s Cup champion in the 1970s got him an invitation by the ruling family of Bahrain to become the country’s National and Davis Cup coach. Pavan’s coaching skills were recognized and acknowledged by the heads of the tennis world’s most important associations. Tennis coach Nick Bollettieri certified him a USPTA Master Professional and Dennis Van Der Meer, the founder of the Professional Tennis Registry (PTR, USA) made him a PTR Charter Member. Pavan was the first and only Indian to be accorded this privilege. While coaching the Bahrain National team over several years, he took the team to the top echelons of the Asia Zone Davis Cup and his players to the ATP top 100 ranks. Post-retirement, he settled in Bengaluru choosing to work with like-minded coaches, who shared his passion and commitment for tennis. Among them was M Krishna Kumar, the founder of the Kinesis Tennis Academy, who became a close friend. At Kumar’s request, Pavan become an advisor to his academy and under his tutelage and guidance, Kinesis went on to produce and train many national and international grade players and coaches. Pavan Murthy often lamented that Indian players were unable to make their presence felt in a big way on the world stage. “We are still stuck in the W.G. Grace era,” he used to comment, adding, “It is time we played modern tennis.” Pointing out that Indian players lacked focus and had a tendency to play their shots ‘blind,’ he felt they lacked the technique to play using heavy top-spin on both flanks. They had an over-reliance on serve-and-volley that was best suited to doubles play. He would continuously emphasize the need to develop good fundamentals among the youngsters and cautioned parents against quick–fix solutions, academy hopping and changing coaches frequently for better results. “Tennis is a long-term commitment and there are no short cuts to success. Perseverance is the key,” was his advice to students and parents alike. While Pavan Murthy is no more with us, we would do well to act on his words of wisdom.|0|

The lure of luxe|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Indians are travelling abroad like never before. According to the UN World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO), India will account for a record 50 million outbound tourists in 2020, a 100% jump from the current 25 million. Indians are also not shying away from spending on and demanding better services in the skies. They are looking for a lot more than a complimentary soup and a few breadsticks on board. What, you may ask? How about a zero-gravity seat in which you can rest your weary self through a long-haul flight? Some even offer mood-lighting, therapy sessions, and believe it or not, private suites! Leading the charge on this crusade to ‘better flying’ are airline companies from Asia and West Asia. Here are some of the most exclusive experiences that are up for offer 35,000 feet above the ground. The goodness of technology For a couple of decades now, Emirates has been convincing us persistently about their prowess as an innovative and luxurious carrier. Their new Boeing 777 liners set the bar pretty high for others. In fact, these flights are designed to make even economy travel a lot more comfortable than one would expect. The First and Business class suites are another deal altogether. Here, patrons have the advantage of walking into their very own private rooms. The novelty in each of these rooms is the inclusion of zero-gravity seats that are specially designed to emulate a feeling of weightlessness. Straight out of NASA, you may imagine. And rightly so. The soft, leathered seats and well-thought-through upholstery match the creature comforts offered by luxury hotels. Middle seats have the advantage of virtual windows that stream a live feed on a make-believe window, so you’re not missing out on anything. How cool is that? You’re also pampered with ambient mood lighting, temperature controls, a 32-inch HD LCD television, Safari binoculars, and an entertainment system with thousands of options. All in all, Emirates and Mercedes have endeavoured to offer the S-Class luxury up in the air. The elements inspired by Mercedes S-Class include the choice of material used, the quality of workmanship and the lighting system, within the First and Business class suites. Essa Sulaiman Ahmad, vice-president, India-Nepal, Emirates, describes it as thoughtful luxury. “This is the first time an Emirates product has been so influenced by another luxury brand, but it is a natural fit as both Emirates and Mercedes-Benz have the same unwavering commitment to fine detail, uncompromising quality, and a drive to push boundaries.” A therapeutic flight Cathay Pacific has got its luxury and passenger care right. Meditation comes to you, on a display screen during a long-haul flight. Cathay Pacific’s ‘Travel Well With Yoga’ ensures that passengers try yoga. The programme offers videos that can be played during flights. These are sprinkled with generous expert advice. The instructions are available in English, Cantonese, Mandarin, and Japanese. The entire programme is split into six easy-to-follow videos, in which Pure Yoga’s founding teacher Patrick Creelman and senior instructor and co-founder Almen Wong demonstrate routines designed to improve circulation, enhance joint mobility and relax the mind. Simon Cuthbert, who manages platforms and connectivity for the airliner, says, “We all know that sitting still for a long period of time can be uncomfortable. The need to get up, move and get your blood pumping is important during a flight. Yoga is an innovative way to do this. There are a series of exercises that can easily be done from an economy class seat, whilst other moves are suitable for after the flight in your hotel,” he says. Cabins for the dreamer First Class travel in Qatar Airways’ Qsuite offers customisable seating areas. Passengers can now use separator panels to adjust the way their partitions and seats are arranged. For instance, by moving partitions around, you could have a bedroom in the sky or a mini conference room if you want one. In addition to seating, even the screens are adjustable. It’s no surprise that the Qsuite was awarded the ‘Best Cabin Concept’, winning the coveted Crystal Cabin Award, a one-of-its-kind international award for excellence in aircraft interior innovation. “We are thrilled to be offering our loyal customers this unique product, which is unlike anything they have experienced before. The features that Qsuite offers provide the ultimate customisable travel experience that enables passengers to create an environment that suits their own needs,” said Qatar Airways Group chief executive, Akbar Al Baker. Rich in health While comfort, technological marvels, and unbelievable customisations are impressive, there’s nothing that comes close to gastronomic pleasures, and Etihad Airways has chosen this as the quickest way to its customers’ hearts. Their newly-introduced Weqaya menu, which quite literally translates to ‘prevention of illnesses’, is now available in business and first-class long-haul and ultra-long-haul outbound flights from Abu Dhabi and luxury lounges. The department of health was instrumental in putting this nutritious and one-of-its-kind menu together. Neerja Bhatia, vice-president–Indian Subcontinent, Etihad Airways, says, “With the addition of the Weqaya menu, we are extending our support to the department of health-Abu Dhabi, and offering an enhanced in-flight dining experience to guests, with more choices on-board.” Alaska Airlines offers its patrons virtual reality headsets and noise-cancelling headphones — because LED screens are so yesterday.

In the right direction|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Jose Sebastian is pleased that his “dream of directing a film” has come true. His directorial début, Ente Ummante Peru, has struck an emotional chord with the audience for its often humorous and heart-warming portrayal of a young man’s search for his mother after his father’s demise. “I was quite confident about Ente Ummante Peru doing well but was also equally nervous since it’s my début,” says the 31-year-old with a laugh over phone from Ernakulam. The focal point of the film is the chemistry between Tovino Thomas, who plays Hameed, a shy guy who goes on a quest to girds up his loins to shed his yatheem (orphan) status, initially, for better matrimonial prospects, after his polygamous father’s passing, and Urvashi, who plays the eccentric Ayisha who effectively keeps us on tenterhooks to find out if she’s his biological mother or not. Although the movie saw the light of the day now, Jose says the seed of the story took root in his mind during his film school (International Film School Sydney in Australia) days in 2012. “I started writing the story in 2015 and finished the first draft by early 2016. I then collaborated with my friend (débutante screenwriter) Sarath R Nath and we polished the script,” says Jose, who studied Computer Science engineering before entering tinsel town. The director had already cast Tovino and Urvashi in the key roles way before the former became the star he is now. “When I met Tovi on the sets of Ennu Ninte Moideen and narrated the story to him, he liked it and committed himself to the project at once. As for Ayisha, I could recall no other face other than Urvashi chechi’s,” he says. Bankrolling the project and Tovino’s subsequent jam-packed schedule delayed the production. Jose, who has previously assisted Marathi filmmaker Nikhil Mahajan and Lijo Jose Pellissery, says he chose such a theme as he “loves to understand and explore human relationships” and how they can be represented fruitfully on screen. “That’s what I look for in my reading too,” he says, mentioning M Mukundan, SK Pottekad and Vaikom Mohammad Basheer as some of his literary inspirations. Nailing the dialect Ente Ummante Peru captures the look and feel of Thalassery in its essence, amply evinced in the Malabari dialect most of the characters converse in, and Jose points out that the scenes were shot where they were set. “I have a lot of friends from the Malabar belt and this helped nail the dialect while writing the dialogues. So the setting came to my mind quite naturally. However, we also did some research to get the backdrop accurate.” Having actors such as Mamukkoya and Hareesh Kanaaran who naturally have a north Kerala accent in the line-up only helped his cause. Thalassery, Kozhikode and Ponnani served as the main locations while he credits Spanish cinematographer Jordi Planell Closa for zooming in on some photogenic locales of Lucknow where Hameed’s quest takes him to. Jose says he was flexible with his script and tapped into “talented cast” for improvisations, especially in the humorous scenes, “to bring in the actors’ signature contributions” as well. As the dust settles, Jose is eager to move on to new projects, though, at this point, he prefers not to divulge any details. He, however, acknowledges that the success of his début has been “a massive confidence booster” to take up bigger, better projects.

In the land of the mountain king|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|An emperor bedecked in a jewelled crown and silk dhoti who left his golden chariot to not disturb a jasmine creeper that got entwined on its wheels — this is how our history books depict Paari. But writer Su Venkatesan’s Paari is a tribal king; broad-shouldered, long-haired, and moustachioed, he’s a man of Nature; one who knows the birds, animals, insects, and plants of the mountains he ruled, like the back of his hand. Venkatesan told the story of the Velir king as a series that ran for over 100 weeks in Tamil magazineAnanda Vikatan. The concluding piece ofVelpariwas published on November 29, 2018. The series, that’s being brought out in book form by Vikatan Publications, was recently launched in the city. The Madurai-based writer also has to his credit the Sahitya Akademi Award-winning novelKaval Kottam(2008). A portion of the historical novel that traces the history of Madurai, was made into the Tamil FilmAravaan(2012).Velparihas been in the making for over six years now; this is no surprise, given the scale of Venkatesan’s research — he pored through Sangam poetry and travelled extensively to tribal settlements of the Western Ghats. “Paari was the head of one among the 14 tribal clans that ruled the Western Ghats, ranging from Goa to Kanyakumari,” says Venkatesan. “It was because he ruled a mountainous terrain, that the Cheras, Cholas, and Pandiyas couldn’t defeat him, despite their combined efforts,” he adds. The story’s soul — the conflict between Nature and man’s greed — is particularly relevant today. “Loving Nature, and striving to protect it, are two sides of a coin,” he says. InVelpari, the lines between history and fiction are blurred. While history supplied him with a rich base to work on — Sangam literature, which, according to Venkatesan, is among the most nuanced works that details the flora and fauna of the time — it marries fiction somewhere along the way. The man cannot stop raving about Sangam poems. “They are treasures. A simple line will speak volumes. For instance, savour the term ‘sirukann yaanai’(the small-eyed elephant). That single reference tells the reader that elephants have small eyes,” he says. The 46-year-old has been travelling with tribal people for the past 15 years to learn about their lives. “This contributed to 50% ofVelpari’sresearch while the rest came from reading modern anthropological and archaeological research on Sangam poetry,” he explains. Artist Maniam Selvan, son of the legendary artist Maniam, has illustrated forVelpari. “He worked with such dedication,” notes Venkatesan. Father of two girls, Venkatesan often finds himself deep inside his stories that he forgets what’s around him. He remembers how when he wroteKaval Kottam, his young daughters ran in and out of his room at his home in Thirunagar, Madurai, and he simply kept writing. They’re older now — his youngest is 16 — and he shudders to think how much of their growing up years he’s lost out on. “Oh don’t remind me,” he says, when we ask of the father-daughter moments he missed. “Just when I’d finishedVelpari, I thought I’d go somewhere with my children. But they were at their grandparent’s then,” he says. “I wondered if this was how my life will be; if I can achieve something only at the cost of something else.” It’s too early to ask what Venkatesan’s next work will be, for he says it’ll take a while for him to leave the world he had created forVelpari.

Just beat it|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Musician B Shree Sundarkumar has had a long-standing grievance. And now, he has decided to do something about it. Sundarkumar — known as the ‘Kanjira Man’ in music circles — is putting together a three-day Beats Festival that, he says, will put the spotlight on percussion. “I have often thought about the subject of percussion, and why it doesn’t get a place of pride in Carnatickutcheris. Though any performance is a joint effort by all the musicians on stage, the percussionist — especially the ones handling theghatam,kanjiraormorsing— are given least importance. In cricket, the man of the match award is given after a game is played...but sadly, in Carnatic music, the ‘man of the match’ happens to be the vocalist by default, even if the percussionist has given his best to the evening and enhanced the performance.” Sundarkumar rates the percussionist as the top performer in any kutcheri. “He (theghatamorkanjiraplayer) is the one who answers the mridangam’s questions musically on stage. This is like answering a spot question on stage. Isn’t that person the best?” It is to celebrate these ‘top performers’ that Sundarkumar, along with the support of Parampara’s Vedantha Ramanujam, is putting together the Beats Festival. The three-day extravaganza will see the coming together of popular musicians, besides showcasing a large array of instruments, like thekanjira,chenda,thavil,ghatamandmridangam. The highlights of the festival include a grandchendapresentation by Mattannoor Sankarankutty Marar and akanjiraquartet, with each performer bringing his own perspective to the instrument. Beats Festival, organised by Kanjiraman Foundation and Parampara, takes place on January 4, 5 and 6, 6.30 pm to 9 pm at Kapaleeshwar Temple, Mylapore. It is open to all.|0|
Where women rule|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|“Ima, Ima, Ima!” You can’t imagine the number of times you will utter this word in Ima Keithel, but you will never get tired of it. Every time I said it, I felt elated.

My bags are packed, I’m ready to go|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST| Zadar has often been outshone by its popular siblings — the charming city of Dubrovnik and party animals Split and Hvar. But those who have visited the port city of Zadar, will vouch that this is where you get gorgeous sunsets. Alfred Hitchcock was amazed by them. At the promenade, hear the lilting tunes from the Sea Organ. Steps lead into the water and those underwater have pipes that create music when waves snuggle up to them. These tunes and the cool breeze make you feel warm, fuzzy and melancholic, all at once. Then there is the installation by architect Nikola Bašić, called Greeting to the Sun. This 22-metre circular disc works on solar energy and emits dazzling lights in the evening. Some use it as a dance floor, others just laze on it, do yoga there or even use it as a romantic prop for proposals. Zadar also hosts music festivals and is a great base from where you can set off to explore national parks and islands. It is teeming with historical monuments such as Fosa, Rector’s Palace, Five Wells, Forum, etc. And you can let you hair down at Varos, a hip neighbourhood brimming with quirky bars. Don’t forget to try their maraschino, local cherry liqueur along with fresh catch from the sea.  Flamingo kitsch has been ruling the fashion world for almost two years now. If these winged wonders look so cool on clothes and accessories, imagine how awesome they’ll look in your holiday pictures. “Flamingos have become insanely popular in the last few years here in Aruba,” says Marcella Janczewski from the Visit Aruba team. They roost on Renaissance Island that has a huge fan following worldwide, thanks to selfies with the pretty pink birds that abound on social media. It is a private island and one needs to buy a day pass in advance. Recently, flamingos have also been introduced to De Palm Island. A day ticket is required here as well. This Dutch island in the Caribbean Sea is also known for its crystal-clear waters, where you can snorkel, sail, scuba dive, kite surf and be a beach bum. It’s sunny, windy and always warm here. “Don’t forget your sunscreen as we are close to the Equator and the sun is strong,” advises Marcella. In addition, she recommends visiting Arikok National Park, the Natural Pool, Bushiribana Gold Mill Ruins, Alto Vista Chapel... “There is a party any day or night of the week here. Wednesday to Sunday are the most popular nights for going out. Clubs, bars and lounges are all closely located (you can find many in the Palm Beach area) so it is easy to hop around. Some hotspots include Gusto Night Club, MooMba Beach Bar and Sand Bar,” says Marcella. Oranjestad is the capital of Aruba and the island nation is small enough to be covered in a day.  The colourful wooden houses of Kalamaja look as if they have stepped out of Noddy land. An area populated by fishermen since the 14th Century, this is now one of the coolest neighbourhoods in Tallinn. While the Old Town is always the most visited, areas such as Kalamaja and Rotermann, with avant garde architecture, are where the trendy, creative set can be spotted. The Telliskivi Creative City — located in a reclaimed factory area — with its eatery, boutiques, an antique book store, theatre and weekly dance nights and flea markets, is sought after. In addition, the city also has a growing number of spas. “Many cruise ships dock in Tallinn. In fact, that’s what brought in tourists around a decade ago,” says Thea Sepp, Information Specialist at the Tallinn Tourist Information Centre. “This year, we have received more than 300 cruise ships with about 6,00,000 tourists,” she adds. The Kohtuotsa viewing platform, Town Hall Square, St Olav’s church, St Catherine’s Passage, Seaplane Harbour and Town Wall find themselves on most sightseeing lists. The Song Festival Grounds is another favourite and the venue for the Estonian Song and Dance Festival that happens once in every five years. Luckily, it will take place this year in July and will feature thousands of dancers and choir performers.  This is one city where you may not feel broke. Don’t forget to get a relaxing massage or a hair spa treatment or even fake eyelashes here. It costs way less than India and the quality is commendable too. Hanoi sits by the Red River, embracing its age-old colonial monuments, temples, museum and mausoleum. It is also proud of its modern Lotte Tower, glitzy hotels and Nhat Tan Bridge. In the heart of the bustling city lies the tranquil Hoan Kiem Lake, one of the most photographed spots in the city. This is also where the Old Quarter is; a commercial area bustling with shops and nightlife. There are specific streets that sell kitchen ware, herbs, cotton, and so on. The tailors in Vietnam are known for their craft. Get a few outfits tailored while there, especially the Ao Dai, the local dress. Try the egg coffee, or the traditional coffee that comes with a generous serving of condensed milk. The variety of street food is mind-boggling. Frombanh mitobun cha, it’ll make sure you never go hungry. You can discover Hanoi by foot, or choose from limos, regular cabs, three-wheeled cycle rickshaws or even motorcycle taxis.  Everything in the Plaza de Espana in Seville has the power to make even the most mediocre photograph look exceptional. There is something magical about the architecture of this city, from the Gothic cathedral, the Giralda, the Alcazar with its Mudejar work, to the narrow lanes that cradle old-world bars and restaurants. It’s where ‘Despacito’ and ‘Chantaje’ are punctuated by the gallop of horses pulling carriages that look straight out of a fairy tale. The recent hot spot is the Metropol Parasol, a 26-metre-high wooden structure that resembles a giant waffle or a mushroom. Flamenco bars thrive in the neighbourhood of Triana that’s across the Guadalquivir river. The bars have more locals than tourists, and matching steps with them is nearly impossible. The dancing starts late by 10 pm and doesn’t stop till the wee hours of the morning. Local singers put up impromptu performances as people show off their Flamenco steps. This is way more fun than just sitting through a serious Flamenco performance.|0|

Theatre for all|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|When it comes to art and culture, Manipur has so much to showcase such as theraas leela,kartal cholom,pung cholom,jagoi,khamba thoibiandlai haraoba. But there is one more which is loved and appreciated by everyone across Manipur — theshumang leela. College student Konsam Henry says if he were to choose between a popular Manipuri film and ashumang leelashow, he would choose the latter. A form of folk theatre,shumang leelais performed to live music by either an all-male cast (who play women’s roles too) or an all-women cast callednupi shumang leela,and occasionally transgenders too. With minimalistic sets, the actors are surrounded by audience from all sides. Traditionally, the play was performed in courtyards. If you want to know why Manipuris findshumang leelaso accessible and relatable, check the local cultural calendar after you reach the ‘Switzerland of India’. The hub ofshumang leela— Iboyaima Shumang Leela Sanglen — might be hosting a Shumang Leela Festival or a performance, you wouldn’t want to miss.|0|
Current trends|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|In the recent past, inspirational stories of sport stars like Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Milkha Singh, and freedom fighters such as Subhas Chandra Bose and Bhagat Singh have been told on the big screen. Soon cinema halls will be taken over by biopics on women achievers, starting with Kangana Ranaut’sManikarnika-The Queen of Jhansibased on the warrior queen. Eminent film and trade business analyst Girish Johar saidManikarnika...in which Kangana plays the title role, is currently trending in the country, and that it has got a “good buzz.” “A popular face does help reach a wider audience because they have their own fans and fan clubs. They are well established and their craft is already recognised. Everyone knows that Kangana does different kinds of films,” Girish said. So, he thinksManikarnika...would hit the jackpot at the box office when it releases later this month. Director Indrajit Lankesh is coming out with a biopic on southern film industry’s adult film star Shakeela. Talking about biopics made on influential women, he said: “Finally, the film industry is opening up to women because maybe in the 1970s or 1980s, they thought that women were only for songs and dancing around the trees. But biopics getting made on women show that there are a lot of women achievers who can stand on their own and it’s great.” Lankesh thought that when Shakeela was dominating in the male-dominated industry in mid 1990s, it was very difficult. “But today, the scenario is slowly changing. I can’t say that it’s completely changed, but I am proud and happy that there are a lot of biopics being made on women.” On his film, he shared: “It is a story about an actress who has seen a life from rags to riches to rags. Her life itself is a very good learning path for any woman.” Lankesh’s film will star actress Richa Chadha as Shakeela. Actress Deepika Padukone is also set to take the story of acid attack survivor Laxmi Agarwal from real to reel. Deepika had said: “It’s a very important story and it’s a true-life incident, so hopefully good things will come out of it.” Actress Shraddha Kapoor will be showing her sporty side by essaying the role of ace badminton player Saina Nehwal. Even down south, film-makers are opening up to the idea of biopics on women. If last year’sMahanatia film about the rise of female south Indian superstar Savitri, won the hearts of many, people can’t stop praising popular south Indian actress Nithya Menen for her look in the new poster of the filmThe Iron Ladybased on late politician Jayalalithaa. “The film on Jayalalithaa is very heavy. I was very impressed when the film’s director Priyadarshini came with the film to me. She was so focused. I told her that if we are doing a biopic, we should ensure complete justice to the character,” Nithya said. It’s not just established actresses who are pumped up about playing real life characters. One-film-old actress Janhvi Kapoor has reportedly taken up a biopic on Gunjan Saxena, an Indian Air Force combat pilot. IANS|0|

The lure of luxe|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Indians are travelling abroad like never before. According to the UN World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO), India will account for a record 50 million outbound tourists in 2020, a 100% jump from the current 25 million. Indians are also not shying away from spending on and demanding better services in the skies. They are looking for a lot more than a complimentary soup and a few breadsticks on board. What, you may ask? How about a zero-gravity seat in which you can rest your weary self through a long-haul flight? Some even offer mood-lighting, therapy sessions, and believe it or not, private suites! Leading the charge on this crusade to ‘better flying’ are airline companies from Asia and West Asia. Here are some of the most exclusive experiences that are up for offer 35,000 feet above the ground. The goodness of technology For a couple of decades now, Emirates has been convincing us persistently about their prowess as an innovative and luxurious carrier. Their new Boeing 777 liners set the bar pretty high for others. In fact, these flights are designed to make even economy travel a lot more comfortable than one would expect. The First and Business class suites are another deal altogether. Here, patrons have the advantage of walking into their very own private rooms. The novelty in each of these rooms is the inclusion of zero-gravity seats that are specially designed to emulate a feeling of weightlessness. Straight out of NASA, you may imagine. And rightly so. The soft, leathered seats and well-thought-through upholstery match the creature comforts offered by luxury hotels. Middle seats have the advantage of virtual windows that stream a live feed on a make-believe window, so you’re not missing out on anything. How cool is that? You’re also pampered with ambient mood lighting, temperature controls, a 32-inch HD LCD television, Safari binoculars, and an entertainment system with thousands of options. All in all, Emirates and Mercedes have endeavoured to offer the S-Class luxury up in the air. The elements inspired by Mercedes S-Class include the choice of material used, the quality of workmanship and the lighting system, within the First and Business class suites. Essa Sulaiman Ahmad, vice-president, India-Nepal, Emirates, describes it as thoughtful luxury. “This is the first time an Emirates product has been so influenced by another luxury brand, but it is a natural fit as both Emirates and Mercedes-Benz have the same unwavering commitment to fine detail, uncompromising quality, and a drive to push boundaries.” A therapeutic flight Cathay Pacific has got its luxury and passenger care right. Meditation comes to you, on a display screen during a long-haul flight. Cathay Pacific’s ‘Travel Well With Yoga’ ensures that passengers try yoga. The programme offers videos that can be played during flights. These are sprinkled with generous expert advice. The instructions are available in English, Cantonese, Mandarin, and Japanese. The entire programme is split into six easy-to-follow videos, in which Pure Yoga’s founding teacher Patrick Creelman and senior instructor and co-founder Almen Wong demonstrate routines designed to improve circulation, enhance joint mobility and relax the mind. Simon Cuthbert, who manages platforms and connectivity for the airliner, says, “We all know that sitting still for a long period of time can be uncomfortable. The need to get up, move and get your blood pumping is important during a flight. Yoga is an innovative way to do this. There are a series of exercises that can easily be done from an economy class seat, whilst other moves are suitable for after the flight in your hotel,” he says. Cabins for the dreamer First Class travel in Qatar Airways’ Qsuite offers customisable seating areas. Passengers can now use separator panels to adjust the way their partitions and seats are arranged. For instance, by moving partitions around, you could have a bedroom in the sky or a mini conference room if you want one. In addition to seating, even the screens are adjustable. It’s no surprise that the Qsuite was awarded the ‘Best Cabin Concept’, winning the coveted Crystal Cabin Award, a one-of-its-kind international award for excellence in aircraft interior innovation. “We are thrilled to be offering our loyal customers this unique product, which is unlike anything they have experienced before. The features that Qsuite offers provide the ultimate customisable travel experience that enables passengers to create an environment that suits their own needs,” said Qatar Airways Group chief executive, Akbar Al Baker. Rich in health While comfort, technological marvels, and unbelievable customisations are impressive, there’s nothing that comes close to gastronomic pleasures, and Etihad Airways has chosen this as the quickest way to its customers’ hearts. Their newly-introduced Weqaya menu, which quite literally translates to ‘prevention of illnesses’, is now available in business and first-class long-haul and ultra-long-haul outbound flights from Abu Dhabi and luxury lounges. The department of health was instrumental in putting this nutritious and one-of-its-kind menu together. Neerja Bhatia, vice-president–Indian Subcontinent, Etihad Airways, says, “With the addition of the Weqaya menu, we are extending our support to the department of health-Abu Dhabi, and offering an enhanced in-flight dining experience to guests, with more choices on-board.” Alaska Airlines offers its patrons virtual reality headsets and noise-cancelling headphones — because LED screens are so yesterday.

Unearth jewels from a treasury|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST| Nature can be baffling, and how! In Loktak lake, you can stand on a piece of land that floats on water. Go boating in the largest freshwater lake in the Northeast and you will come across several floating swamps which are heterogeneous masses of vegetation, soil and organic matter. In the south-western part of the lake is located Keibul Lamjao National Park, probably the world’s largest floating park, which was declared a national park in 1977. If you are lucky you might get a glimpse of the reclusive Sangai here, the endangered brow-antlered deer, also the State animal of Manipur. The Sangai is also called the dancing deer because when it moves on the floating park, it appears to dance on the waters. The construction of the Ithai Barrage for the Loktak Hydro Electric Project, has altered the ecology of the lake. Designated as the Ramsar Wetland of International Importance, the lake is home to diverse flora and fauna, such as several species of aquatic plants, birds, and animals, including the Indian python. The lake is a lifeline for Manipur, especially for its fishermen.|0|

As an associate professor in Mathematics based in Orsay, France, he frequently visits the Chennai Mathematical Institute for his work. But the evenings, he devotes to exploring the vibrant city life. This is how he encountered the traditional dance form of Bharatanatyam. “For a long time, I could see that there was something more to be understood in the performances, but I could not, despite having read both theMahabharataand theRamayana. Then once I saw a dancer narrate the episodes of theRamayanaandvoila— I could truly understand it, with some extra effort.” According to Joël, this dance brings out the highest forms of emotions. And it led him to learning Bharatanatyam from Kuttalam M Selvam. An informedraasika, he rattles off names of his favourite performers like a pro. Among the musicians, he adores are TM Krishna, Aruna Sairam, K Hariprasad and Jayanthi Kumaresh, while his favorite dancers are Lavanya Ananth, Sudharma Vaidyanathan, Meenakshi Srinivasan and Arupa Lahiri.

Bean to the fair?|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Come December and Bengaluru is brimming with avarekai (dolichos lablab). The climate in Karnataka results in a plentiful crop. The avarebele, or the bean lends itself to a variety of dishes from rasam, uppittu, rotti, dose, idli, saagu and bisibelebath to dry savouries. It was Vasvi Condiments’ eye for experimentation that rolled out creative dishes with the bean from 2000 onwards. Over the years the condiment store, that organises the Avarebele Mela in Food Street at VV Puram, has pioneered on various dishes with the bean including sweets such as holige, halwa, chikki, payasa and Mysore pak. “This year we have avarekai ice-cream,” says Geetha Shivakumar, 54, co-founder of Vasavi Condiments with her husband Shivakumar. “It required months of experimentation. Food experts helped us and we decided to go ahead with the ice-cream.” The ice-cream is made out of boiled and mashed bean, milk, cream and sugar. “We installed a softee ice-cream machine made in Gurgaon. The bean is boiled in milk and mashed before being mixed with other ingredients and churned. We serve them in cones topped with roasted avarekalu. The cones cost Rs. 30 each,” says Geetha. Sweet choya, where urad dal batter and sugar form the covering for avarekai stuffing, which is fried in oil is another innovation at the mela. “Although the dish is originally from the desert regions of India where the dumplings are made of other dals,” says Geetha. Also available at the mela are roll, Manchurian, rumali roti, jamoon, jalebi and chandrakala all made from the wonder bean. While many dishes are made out of the whole bean with the skin such as uppittu, pulao, masala idly and usli, thehitikbelevarieties (without the skin) is used for holige, saaru (rasam) masala vade, bonda, nippat masala, hitikbele rottis, paddu, rice bath, othu shavige, puri-hitikbele and dose. “They are a meal by itself, as the bean is very filling,” says Geetha. People flock to mela from far and wide. Ragini Rao, physiotherapist says she regularly checks it out with her son as she’d rather “have hitikbele holige here than try them out at home.” Students from nearby engineering colleges say “we forget about other hotels for at least a week during the mela.” Seniors who take a walk at the VV Puram Circle say, “We love the masala avare bath and the crispy vadas.” Swathi KS, daughter of the Shivakumars who is also one of the key members steering the mela says, she is happy that her parents have not only given the bean pride of place at the mela, but also have hundreds of farmers grow the crop with a purpose. “Avarebele Mela is in its 19th run this year. We have developed a bond with the locals here, and the mela is significant event in Bengaluru’s calendar,” says Swathi, adding that the organic waste generated is made into brickets that serve as fuel. Vasavi Condiments’ fried avarebele, is popular with NRIs for its taste and long shelf life. From savouries, the establishment graduated to hitikbele sambar and payasa and the demand led to a full-fledged fair dedicated to the bean. “Today we have nearly 60 kinds of fried-mix Hitikbele including flavours such as pudina masala, garlic, dhaniya, pepper, sabakki soppu, kothambari and karibevu amongst others,” says Geetha. Every Avarebele Mela uses 10,000 kg of the bean. The 10-day affair attracts 40,000 people during weekends. Nearly 600 farmer families are involved in the growing of the crop sourced from Magadi, Chintamani, Kolar, Mulbagal, Hunsur, Dodda Ballapura, Chikkaballapura, Chitradurga and smaller villages near Tumakuru, Devanahalli and Anekal. Avarebele Mela is on at Sajjan Rao Circle, VV Puram till January 8.|0|
‘Each one must do his bit’|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|We have been living in Sadashivnagar for 27 years now. Before this the whole family lived in Chennai as most of the film studios were housed there. I was born there too. Soon after my birth, the entire family shifted here and has been residing here since. Sadashivnagar was a lovely place to live in those days. There were plenty of trees, fresh air, no traffic and the temperature here used to be much cooler compared to the rest of the city. We had a huge garden, which would be brimming with insects and butterflies. On quiet nights we could also hear the sound of crickets and frogs croaking during the monsoons. We would wake up to the sounds of birds chirping. The change I see now is that there are no birds at all. All we hear is traffic sounds and the impatient vehicle honks. When we were reconstructing this house, we shifted to RT Nagar. The place was crowded and was brimming with traffic. We longed to come back to Sadashivnagar. Sadly, when we shifted back once the construction was done, this place too started to look and feel like RT Nagar. The road where our house stands has almost become like a main road. All the traffic is deviated here. I believe a residential area should not have loud or speeding vehicles as it is not safe for the residents and children cannot play out. But that is what has been happening now. Unwinding  The city is just too crowded, so we me and my friends mostly hang out at my place. We have a lovely terrace, surrounded by trees. That is our favourite hangout. We also visit a lot of food joints as I am a foodie. We visit the typical local joints where a normal Bangalorean would not think of going. Most of them serve non-vegetarian food. One place we frequent a lot is Siddiqu in Johnson Market. We binge on the sheekh kebabs here and top it off with tea at a joint called Mecca. Sulaiman tea tops our list here. There is also a food joint in Kalasipalya, that we visit often. These are the places where I have eaten some of the tastiest food ever. They make mutton chops, kheema curry and more. When you talk of food, you must go to such places where you are sure to get that local flavour. In the premium segment, I enjoy the ambience and food at Windsor Manor. The place is associated with a lot of childhood memories when I would accompany my parents and grandparents for their meets or shoots. Infrastructure  I don’t think our city is built for this kind of development. There seems to be a sudden influx of people in this city. I feel the number of people is growing and not the space in the city. Our roads too cannot be extended due to buildings that have been housed there for years, some of which are heritage properties. Our city was not meant for this kind of development. I remember my grandfather telling me that Kempegowda built this city with four towers. Once you crossed that tower, it meant you were out of this garden city. As a child most of us have seen many parks, lakes and gardens that thrived here. But today all we see is buildings, traffic and people. We can still make things better if everyone takes ownership of their surroundings. Try car pooling. It helps to bond better with friends and family. Each one should come up with ideas in their own small way to conserve the natural resources and contribute to the city. Home is where we could start first —like having a tiny garden in what ever space we can afford. This column features the city through the eyes of a prominent Bangalorean As told to Shilpa Sebastian R|0|
10 earworms of 2018|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The quality of Bollywood music continued on a downward spiral in 2018 but the multi-composer soundtracks and remixes kept going north. In fact, this was the year that even biggies like AR Rahman and Amit Trivedi got sucked into the multi-composer vortex. One little silver lining, though, has been the ease in compiling the top songs for the year. However, if not for some soundtracks bolstering the scene in the second half of 2018 even a reasonable number of picks would have been difficult to make. Here are the 10 that stood out in 2018. Hallaa(Manmarziyaan) Composer Amit Trivedi’s busiest year to date was also a rather middling one for most part, until he reunited with the man who gave him his first break, Anurag Kashyap. While the characteritsic repetitiveness of Trivedi was a problem here too, there was more than enough great music on offer.‘Hallaa’,written by Shellee, is my pick for the pulsating orchestration, Jyoti Nooran’s rendition and also for the moment in the movie when the song appears. Dilbaro(Raazi) The most popular song fromRaaziand quite deservedly so; Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy and Gulzar build a beautiful“bidaai”song around a traditional Kashmiri wedding piece. Harshdeep Kaur takes care of the rest, with brief but effective cameos from Vibha Saraf and Shankar Mahadevan. Bol Ke Lab(Manto) The most exciting aspect about the Nandita Das film, at least to me, was the return of Sneha Khanwalkar, that too in style. In this song, Faiz’s powerful poetry gets a raag Yaman-flavoured melody from the composer. She has two classical exponents — Rashid Khan and Vidya Shah — singing it and adorns it with a rich backdrop of strings, harmonium and clarinets.    Nainowale Ne(Padmaavat) One of the best things about Sanjay Leela Bhansali movies is the visual representation of songs. It was surprising therefore that the best song ofPadmaavatnever even made it to the screen. Neeti Mohan leads this lovely melody that takes on the occasional wistful tone with the raag Darbari Kanada flavoured cues on sitar. Dhadak(Dhadak) The problem with remakes is that you find yourself hard-pressed not to keep comparing them with the original work. Even taking that into account, the title song ofDhadak(remake of Nagraj Manjule’s Marathi hitSairat) holds up admirably. It is hard not to fall in love with Ajay Atul’s lush violins and haunting tune, delivered by Ajay Gogavle and Shreya Ghoshal. Andhadhun(Andhadhun) While Amit Trivedi produced a competent set of songs for Sriram Raghavan inAndhadhun, my favourite still remains the guest composition by Raftaar and Girish Nakod. The piano and percussion-heavy (always a sucker for Marathi percussion!) title song perfectly captures the heady rush of the ride that the movie turns out to be. Chaav Laga(Sui Dhaaga) The team that gave us ‘Moh Moh Ke Dhaage’ (Dum Laga Ke Haisha) two years back reunited inSui Dhaagato deliver another simple yet beautiful piece, the wonderful Ronkini Gupta being the only addition on the vocal front this time. Mere Naam Tu(Zero) While the reviews of the movie have been mixed, what everyone appears to agree on is how well this song has been depicted on screen. An incredible melody backed by Ajay Atul’s trademark sweeping orchestration and a fabulous Bollywood playback debut for Abhay Jodhpurkar. Naina Banjare(Pataakha) Vishal Bhardwaj-Gulzar soundtrack for the movie was an uncharacteristically short one and not as top notch as their previous albums. In this song the duo gets everything right, with ample help from Arijit of course. A gem that in its light-heartedness takes my mind back to‘Dil Toh Bachcha Hai Ji’fromIshqiya. Mujhe Chaand Pe Le Chalo(Sanju) AR Rahman was more active in the South this year, his two songs forSanju’ssix-song soundtrack being the only Bollywood contributions. The shoddy visual treatment the song received might have something to do with it not becoming particularly popular, but there is no denying the brilliance of this dreamy, sensual piece written by Irshad Kamil sung with a fitting verve by Nikhita Gandhi.|0|
My bags are packed, I’m ready to go|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST| Zadar has often been outshone by its popular siblings — the charming city of Dubrovnik and party animals Split and Hvar. But those who have visited the port city of Zadar, will vouch that this is where you get gorgeous sunsets. Alfred Hitchcock was amazed by them. At the promenade, hear the lilting tunes from the Sea Organ. Steps lead into the water and those underwater have pipes that create music when waves snuggle up to them. These tunes and the cool breeze make you feel warm, fuzzy and melancholic, all at once. Then there is the installation by architect Nikola Bašić, called Greeting to the Sun. This 22-metre circular disc works on solar energy and emits dazzling lights in the evening. Some use it as a dance floor, others just laze on it, do yoga there or even use it as a romantic prop for proposals. Zadar also hosts music festivals and is a great base from where you can set off to explore national parks and islands. It is teeming with historical monuments such as Fosa, Rector’s Palace, Five Wells, Forum, etc. And you can let you hair down at Varos, a hip neighbourhood brimming with quirky bars. Don’t forget to try their maraschino, local cherry liqueur along with fresh catch from the sea.  Flamingo kitsch has been ruling the fashion world for almost two years now. If these winged wonders look so cool on clothes and accessories, imagine how awesome they’ll look in your holiday pictures. “Flamingos have become insanely popular in the last few years here in Aruba,” says Marcella Janczewski from the Visit Aruba team. They roost on Renaissance Island that has a huge fan following worldwide, thanks to selfies with the pretty pink birds that abound on social media. It is a private island and one needs to buy a day pass in advance. Recently, flamingos have also been introduced to De Palm Island. A day ticket is required here as well. This Dutch island in the Caribbean Sea is also known for its crystal-clear waters, where you can snorkel, sail, scuba dive, kite surf and be a beach bum. It’s sunny, windy and always warm here. “Don’t forget your sunscreen as we are close to the Equator and the sun is strong,” advises Marcella. In addition, she recommends visiting Arikok National Park, the Natural Pool, Bushiribana Gold Mill Ruins, Alto Vista Chapel... “There is a party any day or night of the week here. Wednesday to Sunday are the most popular nights for going out. Clubs, bars and lounges are all closely located (you can find many in the Palm Beach area) so it is easy to hop around. Some hotspots include Gusto Night Club, MooMba Beach Bar and Sand Bar,” says Marcella. Oranjestad is the capital of Aruba and the island nation is small enough to be covered in a day.  The colourful wooden houses of Kalamaja look as if they have stepped out of Noddy land. An area populated by fishermen since the 14th Century, this is now one of the coolest neighbourhoods in Tallinn. While the Old Town is always the most visited, areas such as Kalamaja and Rotermann, with avant garde architecture, are where the trendy, creative set can be spotted. The Telliskivi Creative City — located in a reclaimed factory area — with its eatery, boutiques, an antique book store, theatre and weekly dance nights and flea markets, is sought after. In addition, the city also has a growing number of spas. “Many cruise ships dock in Tallinn. In fact, that’s what brought in tourists around a decade ago,” says Thea Sepp, Information Specialist at the Tallinn Tourist Information Centre. “This year, we have received more than 300 cruise ships with about 6,00,000 tourists,” she adds. The Kohtuotsa viewing platform, Town Hall Square, St Olav’s church, St Catherine’s Passage, Seaplane Harbour and Town Wall find themselves on most sightseeing lists. The Song Festival Grounds is another favourite and the venue for the Estonian Song and Dance Festival that happens once in every five years. Luckily, it will take place this year in July and will feature thousands of dancers and choir performers.  This is one city where you may not feel broke. Don’t forget to get a relaxing massage or a hair spa treatment or even fake eyelashes here. It costs way less than India and the quality is commendable too. Hanoi sits by the Red River, embracing its age-old colonial monuments, temples, museum and mausoleum. It is also proud of its modern Lotte Tower, glitzy hotels and Nhat Tan Bridge. In the heart of the bustling city lies the tranquil Hoan Kiem Lake, one of the most photographed spots in the city. This is also where the Old Quarter is; a commercial area bustling with shops and nightlife. There are specific streets that sell kitchen ware, herbs, cotton, and so on. The tailors in Vietnam are known for their craft. Get a few outfits tailored while there, especially the Ao Dai, the local dress. Try the egg coffee, or the traditional coffee that comes with a generous serving of condensed milk. The variety of street food is mind-boggling. Frombanh mitobun cha, it’ll make sure you never go hungry. You can discover Hanoi by foot, or choose from limos, regular cabs, three-wheeled cycle rickshaws or even motorcycle taxis.  Everything in the Plaza de Espana in Seville has the power to make even the most mediocre photograph look exceptional. There is something magical about the architecture of this city, from the Gothic cathedral, the Giralda, the Alcazar with its Mudejar work, to the narrow lanes that cradle old-world bars and restaurants. It’s where ‘Despacito’ and ‘Chantaje’ are punctuated by the gallop of horses pulling carriages that look straight out of a fairy tale. The recent hot spot is the Metropol Parasol, a 26-metre-high wooden structure that resembles a giant waffle or a mushroom. Flamenco bars thrive in the neighbourhood of Triana that’s across the Guadalquivir river. The bars have more locals than tourists, and matching steps with them is nearly impossible. The dancing starts late by 10 pm and doesn’t stop till the wee hours of the morning. Local singers put up impromptu performances as people show off their Flamenco steps. This is way more fun than just sitting through a serious Flamenco performance.|0|
Theatre for all|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|When it comes to art and culture, Manipur has so much to showcase such as theraas leela,kartal cholom,pung cholom,jagoi,khamba thoibiandlai haraoba. But there is one more which is loved and appreciated by everyone across Manipur — theshumang leela. College student Konsam Henry says if he were to choose between a popular Manipuri film and ashumang leelashow, he would choose the latter. A form of folk theatre,shumang leelais performed to live music by either an all-male cast (who play women’s roles too) or an all-women cast callednupi shumang leela,and occasionally transgenders too. With minimalistic sets, the actors are surrounded by audience from all sides. Traditionally, the play was performed in courtyards. If you want to know why Manipuris findshumang leelaso accessible and relatable, check the local cultural calendar after you reach the ‘Switzerland of India’. The hub ofshumang leela— Iboyaima Shumang Leela Sanglen — might be hosting a Shumang Leela Festival or a performance, you wouldn’t want to miss.|0|
Talent at the table|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Karthika Srinivas is in the news for giving an immersive experience to viewers as an editor of Telugu filmAntariksham 9000 KMPH. He has been in the industry since 2013 and worked as Marthand Venkatesh’s assistant and associate; From100% Love,he began working independently. He made a mark with films like1-Nenokkadine,Hello Guru Prema Kosameand nowAntariksham. There are 17 more in the pipeline, he informs. Machilipatnam-based Karthika came to Hyderabad after finishing a course in multimedia in Vijayawada. He worked with editor Shankar before moving to work with Marthand Venkatesh. “Those days, Avid was quite popular, it made my work easier and I learnt quite a lot during the shoot ofAarya. Liking the film is different from conveying it in an appealing way to the audience. That is a different ball game. Narrating a scene through screenplay in a single shot interestingly was Marthand’s forte. We can open a scene in a room through a wide shot and show a person talking to three people simultaneously. We can also show the same by showing one person talking to them through a cutting process, shifting attention from one to the other,” shares Karthika enthusiastically. It has become common for directors to shoot four-plus hours of footage when all they require is two-and-a-half hour of narration, with an additional half hour to choose and play with. Karthika concurs that it has become a strain on the editors. The directors think they are giving a lot of options for the editor to choose from for a correct angle but that, in fact, is a cumbersome process. He says, “Earlier we have been given one lakh feet to 120 feet exposure for big films. It is expensive and stressful. Avid has made our work easier but, for making one hour reel compact, we edit for seven hours making sure an angle, shot, or expression is good and is in continuity. When we see the rushes, we know for sure which is the best one. Later we make sure we don’t miss it and add some more. We keep taking opinions of so many assistants in the edit room and do the necessary corrections.” Karthika feels that working on1-Nenokkadine,AntarikshamandKarthikeyagave him immense satisfaction. Ask Karthika, the challenging part of the film, and he states the obvious. Editing the film without sound in green mat is a test of ability. In the editing room, Karthika sometimes works on some 600 CG shots to narrow it down to 200. An editor sees a film a 100 times till it goes to the censor, and everyday he feels something new can be done. Karthika cherishes the challenges. His next project is a biopic on a student leader of Osmania University calledGeorge Reddy.Jeevan is the director.  When we see the rushes, we know for sure which is the best one. Later, we make sure we don’t miss it and add some more|0|

Slow and steady wins the race|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The hatchling swiftly makes his way to the Arabian Sea with determination and the agile movement of his tiny flippers. He embraces the foamy waves and swims away to begin a new life. He is one of the many baby green sea turtles born on Ras Al Jinz beach in Oman that night. Yet, he is one of the few that survived the dangerous journey from the nest to the water. Natural predators like dogs, foxes, birds and crabs add to the man-made global threat of extinction. It’s been over 150 million years since sea turtles first called oceans their home. Today, rampant hunting, relentless development of coastlines, fishing, marine pollution and the indiscriminate degradation of nesting beaches are threatening their survival. Humans ruthlessly continue to harvest turtles for their meat and shells and litter beaches and seas with plastic waste, glass bottles, cans, fishing ropes and lines. These are hazardous for the turtles that could die if they ate the garbage on the beach. All for conservation In such testing times, Ras Al Jinz Reserve, which was declared a reserve in 1996, is a shining example of continued turtle conservation. Along its 45-kilometre coastline, it protects sea turtles and their nesting sites. It is heartening that nearly 30,000 nestingchelonia mydasor green turtles visit this reserve each year. “During the hatching season, between October and November, nearly 1,30,000 turtles are born. Each year, we see the hatching of around 5,50,000 turtles,” states Vijay Handa, reserve general manager. Though green turtles are the main species that nest here, olive ridleys, loggerhead turtles and hawksbill turtles also swim to this beach. While the peak season for laying eggs is between June and September, Ras Al Jinz beach is the only place in the world where green turtles come every night to lay eggs through the year. Every night, at least one turtle lays her eggs on the beach. The reserve shares its success story with visitors via guided turtle-watching tours, which include both walk-ins, and guests who stay at the reserve’s 31 rooms and luxury eco-tents. For in-house guests, tours are included in their stay package. These awareness-generating and sensitising tours are conducted daily — at 4 am and 9 pm. Participants are briefed before the commencement of each tour by a ranger. Flashlights cannot be used once the nesting site is reached, guests should be with the ranger at all times and maintain silence to ensure that they do not disturb the creatures. “We also patrol the beach and baby turtles that lose their way are saved and returned to the sea,” adds Hameed, a ranger. Ras Al Jinz beach is reserved for turtle nesting. Camping, barbeques and picnics on the beach are strictly prohibited. Fishermen and local communities don’t mess with the dedicated rangers. They know they are on the radar with rangers monitoring them. “The range for baby turtles staying alive is three turtles from every 1,000. Due to the dedicated efforts of our staff, we’ve witnessed an average of five turtles out of 1,000 making it,” adds Handa with a hint of pride. Museum for turtles Another initiative of the Reserve is the turtle museum. It educates visitors in Arabic, English and German about the cultural importance of these marine beings. Many coastal people believe that sea turtles and fish were their ancestors. This belief holds true in Oman as well. While sea turtles find mention in Greek, Vietnamese, Japanese and Chinese mythology, countries of the Indian and Pacific Ocean took it a notch up by printing currency notes and stamps with sea turtles on them. In Indian mythology, in one of his incarnations, Lord Vishnu manifested himself as a turtle.  Did you know? * Marine turtles are toothless, and they have beaks that help them feed. * The sense of smell in turtles is as developed, if not more than that of dogs. * Turtles see the world in colour.  Nearly 30,000 nesting chelonia mydas or green turtles visit this reserve each year|0|
Mirroring us|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|All that time spent scrolling through social media posts is taking a toll. For some travellers, vacations don’t matter unless they are in picture-perfect spots that can be shared on social media platforms. Some mimic poses of their favourite celebrities, while a few others scout for similar accommodation. Results of a recent survey show the extent of social media stimulus on vacation and behaviour patterns of Indian travellers. Around 66% of Indian travellers surveyed by Booking.com stated that they see travel as a potential opportunity to earn a living as an influencer or travel blogger. The web portal’s travel predictions for 2019 reveals that social media will continue to impact the way we travel. Insights were gathered from over 163 million verified guest reviews, along with its research encompassing 21,500 travellers across 29 countries (1,000 from India). The results found seven in 10 Indian travellers to be excited about the prospect of space travel in 2019 and beyond, and are open to considering the experience themselves, while three in five travellers say they would rather stay in accommodation under the sea than in space. Further, the survey revealed that 53% of Indian travellers look at where celebrities stay and try to find accommodation that looks similar. In fact, 24% of Indian travellers try to re-create poses from one of their favourite celebs or Instagrammers. Giving in to the pressure of social media gratification, 30% respondents admitted to having posted an older, more flattering image from a previous holiday rather than from their current trip. And 42% have taken a picture of a different accommodation pretending they are staying there. About 63% want to stay in accommodation that will look good on social media, and 22% have pretended to still be on vacation when they are actually at home.|0|
The lure of luxe|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Indians are travelling abroad like never before. According to the UN World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO), India will account for a record 50 million outbound tourists in 2020, a 100% jump from the current 25 million. Indians are also not shying away from spending on and demanding better services in the skies. They are looking for a lot more than a complimentary soup and a few breadsticks on board. What, you may ask? How about a zero-gravity seat in which you can rest your weary self through a long-haul flight? Some even offer mood-lighting, therapy sessions, and believe it or not, private suites! Leading the charge on this crusade to ‘better flying’ are airline companies from Asia and West Asia. Here are some of the most exclusive experiences that are up for offer 35,000 feet above the ground. The goodness of technology For a couple of decades now, Emirates has been convincing us persistently about their prowess as an innovative and luxurious carrier. Their new Boeing 777 liners set the bar pretty high for others. In fact, these flights are designed to make even economy travel a lot more comfortable than one would expect. The First and Business class suites are another deal altogether. Here, patrons have the advantage of walking into their very own private rooms. The novelty in each of these rooms is the inclusion of zero-gravity seats that are specially designed to emulate a feeling of weightlessness. Straight out of NASA, you may imagine. And rightly so. The soft, leathered seats and well-thought-through upholstery match the creature comforts offered by luxury hotels. Middle seats have the advantage of virtual windows that stream a live feed on a make-believe window, so you’re not missing out on anything. How cool is that? You’re also pampered with ambient mood lighting, temperature controls, a 32-inch HD LCD television, Safari binoculars, and an entertainment system with thousands of options. All in all, Emirates and Mercedes have endeavoured to offer the S-Class luxury up in the air. The elements inspired by Mercedes S-Class include the choice of material used, the quality of workmanship and the lighting system, within the First and Business class suites. Essa Sulaiman Ahmad, vice-president, India-Nepal, Emirates, describes it as thoughtful luxury. “This is the first time an Emirates product has been so influenced by another luxury brand, but it is a natural fit as both Emirates and Mercedes-Benz have the same unwavering commitment to fine detail, uncompromising quality, and a drive to push boundaries.” A therapeutic flight Cathay Pacific has got its luxury and passenger care right. Meditation comes to you, on a display screen during a long-haul flight. Cathay Pacific’s ‘Travel Well With Yoga’ ensures that passengers try yoga. The programme offers videos that can be played during flights. These are sprinkled with generous expert advice. The instructions are available in English, Cantonese, Mandarin, and Japanese. The entire programme is split into six easy-to-follow videos, in which Pure Yoga’s founding teacher Patrick Creelman and senior instructor and co-founder Almen Wong demonstrate routines designed to improve circulation, enhance joint mobility and relax the mind. Simon Cuthbert, who manages platforms and connectivity for the airliner, says, “We all know that sitting still for a long period of time can be uncomfortable. The need to get up, move and get your blood pumping is important during a flight. Yoga is an innovative way to do this. There are a series of exercises that can easily be done from an economy class seat, whilst other moves are suitable for after the flight in your hotel,” he says. Cabins for the dreamer First Class travel in Qatar Airways’ Qsuite offers customisable seating areas. Passengers can now use separator panels to adjust the way their partitions and seats are arranged. For instance, by moving partitions around, you could have a bedroom in the sky or a mini conference room if you want one. In addition to seating, even the screens are adjustable. It’s no surprise that the Qsuite was awarded the ‘Best Cabin Concept’, winning the coveted Crystal Cabin Award, a one-of-its-kind international award for excellence in aircraft interior innovation. “We are thrilled to be offering our loyal customers this unique product, which is unlike anything they have experienced before. The features that Qsuite offers provide the ultimate customisable travel experience that enables passengers to create an environment that suits their own needs,” said Qatar Airways Group chief executive, Akbar Al Baker. Rich in health While comfort, technological marvels, and unbelievable customisations are impressive, there’s nothing that comes close to gastronomic pleasures, and Etihad Airways has chosen this as the quickest way to its customers’ hearts. Their newly-introduced Weqaya menu, which quite literally translates to ‘prevention of illnesses’, is now available in business and first-class long-haul and ultra-long-haul outbound flights from Abu Dhabi and luxury lounges. The department of health was instrumental in putting this nutritious and one-of-its-kind menu together. Neerja Bhatia, vice-president–Indian Subcontinent, Etihad Airways, says, “With the addition of the Weqaya menu, we are extending our support to the department of health-Abu Dhabi, and offering an enhanced in-flight dining experience to guests, with more choices on-board.” Alaska Airlines offers its patrons virtual reality headsets and noise-cancelling headphones — because LED screens are so yesterday.

Boycott and Nadal rolled into one|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|This week’s column is the continuation of the mini-series ‘Birds of the Reed-bed’. Having watched Greater painted-snipes at this reedy patch in Karapakkam the past few weeks, I can't help resorting to sporting analogies to describe their behaviour. In cricketing terms, they are occupiers. They can stick to their crease with the tenacity of a Boycott. By tennis analogy, they are baseliners. They are drawn to the outer rims of reed-beds. When you are on the baseline, you are closer to the spectators. Painfully shy, these birds may however want to be as removed from spectators as possible. And they manage to reconcile these contradictory inclinations. Though on the outlying area, their chosen space invariably has reed cover around it, so that they can beat a quick retreat. This retiring behaviour is not entirely unique to Greater painted-snipes. Other snipes are shy too and display similar behaviour; but the Greater painted-snipes refine shy behaviour to an art. At this patch, I have seen the Common snipes (which are winter-visitors) as well as the Greater painted-snipes freeze into a statue-like state, seemingly motivated by the belief that doing so keeps them unspotted. Having watched a Greater painted-snipe stay frozen in this manner for 30 minutes or thereabouts, I have reason to believe they can beat their cousins, wings-down, in this game. With their diffidence, both the Common snipes and Greater painted-snipes together present a picture that contrasts with the behaviour of Wood sandpipers (found in good numbers at this patch), which don't seem to mind attention. These Wood sandpipers often take off into a wing-flaring, hovering flight asserting their claim over their space, when a purple moorhen passes by. Note:There are many other interesting facets to the Greater painted-snipe, including sexual dimorphism and parental investment, that make for an engaging discussion, and so I will revisIt this beautiful bird at a later date. Field Notes is a weekly column about the resident as well as winter-visiting birds of Chennai   THE NAMEPLATE The painted-snipes found here are known by the binomial nameRostratula benghalensisand, commonly, as the Greater painted-snipe. They are found in parts of Africa, South-East Asia and South Asia, including India.|0|
When the sky is the limit|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Want to wing your way across like a skylark or swoop like a falcon above the infinite blue stretch of the Bay of Bengal? Here is your chance to do that — fly in the sky! For the third consecutive year, Vihang Adventures in association with AP Tourism have brought powered paragliding activities to R K Beach. This year, a 12-member crew of the Kadapa-based Vihang Adventures will paramotoring activities with two powered paragliders. The annual aero-adventure sports affair co-incides with the Visakha Utsav. The response has been overwhelming and the organisers are extending the adventure till January 10. “We are planning to seek permission to extend it till Sankranti. The conditions are perfect in the city this time of the year for paramotoring activities,” says Surya Teja, a pilot-instructor of Vihang Adventures. Every day, the team assesses the flying feasibility before starting the rides. This year, powered paragliding activities started on the second day of Visakha Utsav due to a delay in getting the required permissions. “The response in the past weekend had been very encouraging and made up for all the delay. We conducted more than 60 rides on a single day on December 31,” Surya says. S Ravikanth, who was one of the first to take up the sortie, says, “It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. The view from top was spectacular and since it glides softly in the air, you almost feel like you are flying!” The adventure sports firm has conducted over 30 paramotoring camps across Andhra Pradesh and Telangana in 2018, including Kakinada and Machilipatnam Beach Festivals and trying to set up a permanent base at RK Beach for paramotoring activities.  A bird’s eye-view The powered paragliders go up to a maximum height of 400 feet in a tandem ride. They have a capacity to fly up to a height of 10,000 feet. The ideal wind-speed should be between eight to 10 knots. Fly over the Kursura Submarine Museum and Hotel Novotel before returning to the starting point on the beach Any one in the age group of 10 to 70 years can enjoy the ride Venue:RK Beach (opp. food court)  Price:Rs. 1,500 (per ride)  Time:8 am to 8.30 pm|0|
Of love and longing|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|“The first guy through the wall always gets bloody,” says director Selvakannan, whose upcoming filmNedunalvaadaihas been in the making for three years. Having worked as an assistant to filmmakers Rajesh M Selva, Saamy and Gandhi Krishna, Selvakannan decided to take the plunge into direction sometime in 2014. However, none of the producers he met was willing to fund the project. “It’s difficult to convince producers with a slightly offbeat film. Had it not been a Karthik Subbaraj, I don’t think producers would’ve encouraged short filmmakers,” he says. A graduate of Sankar Polytechnic College, Tirunelveli, it was Selva’s classmates who helped him with the funds. “People usually opt for crowdfunding for experimental films. But that’s not the case with my film,” he says, adding, “Since producers weren’t ready to take the risk, my friends did.” At the same time, Selva is confident that the film will be critically acclaimed. “Thenmerku Paruvakaatrufailed at the box office. But Vijay Sethupathi and Seenu Ramasamy have become big now. Irrespective of the box-office results, they’ve achieved their purpose.” What’s interesting about the film is that it tells the story from a female perspective, which is a rarity in Tamil cinema. Echoing the same, Selva says that the female character is central theme of the film. Through his film, Selva wanted to question the representation of women in mainstream cinema, “People howl and whistle to scenes that are deeply sexist. It’s easy for men to express their emotions post break-up. But a woman has to go through a lot, internally. These are some of the things I looked into before writing.” Smaller films continue to bear the brunt when it comes to the availability of screens. However, Selva believes that the scenario today is much better than what it was when he started out. “There’s an acceptance for a film likeMerku Thodarchi Malai, which is very encouraging for filmmakers like me.” Inspired by the poem written by Nakkeerar in Sangam literature, the film, as the title suggest, is about the separation — of a man and woman, and a grandfather and his grandson. Quizzed whetherNedunalvaadaiis yet another issue-based film, Selvakannan quickly clarifies that he doesn’t believe in message-driven films. “Who am I to preach to others? The film talks about several things and we’ve tried to maintain a sensitive approach,” he says, adding thatNedunalvaadaiis more on the lines of a Cheran film.  The success of Merku Thodarchi Malaiis very encouraging for filmmakers like me|0|

Mirroring us|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|All that time spent scrolling through social media posts is taking a toll. For some travellers, vacations don’t matter unless they are in picture-perfect spots that can be shared on social media platforms. Some mimic poses of their favourite celebrities, while a few others scout for similar accommodation. Results of a recent survey show the extent of social media stimulus on vacation and behaviour patterns of Indian travellers. Around 66% of Indian travellers surveyed by Booking.com stated that they see travel as a potential opportunity to earn a living as an influencer or travel blogger. The web portal’s travel predictions for 2019 reveals that social media will continue to impact the way we travel. Insights were gathered from over 163 million verified guest reviews, along with its research encompassing 21,500 travellers across 29 countries (1,000 from India). The results found seven in 10 Indian travellers to be excited about the prospect of space travel in 2019 and beyond, and are open to considering the experience themselves, while three in five travellers say they would rather stay in accommodation under the sea than in space. Further, the survey revealed that 53% of Indian travellers look at where celebrities stay and try to find accommodation that looks similar. In fact, 24% of Indian travellers try to re-create poses from one of their favourite celebs or Instagrammers. Giving in to the pressure of social media gratification, 30% respondents admitted to having posted an older, more flattering image from a previous holiday rather than from their current trip. And 42% have taken a picture of a different accommodation pretending they are staying there. About 63% want to stay in accommodation that will look good on social media, and 22% have pretended to still be on vacation when they are actually at home.|0|
In the right direction|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Jose Sebastian is pleased that his “dream of directing a film” has come true. His directorial début,Ente Ummante Peru, has struck an emotional chord with the audience for its often humorous and heart-warming portrayal of a young man’s search for his mother after his father’s demise. “I was quite confident aboutEnte Ummante Perudoing well but was also equally nervous since it’s my début,” says the 31-year-old with a laugh over phone from Ernakulam. The focal point of the film is the chemistry between Tovino Thomas, who plays Hameed, a shy guy who goes on a quest to shed hisyatheem(orphan) status, initially, for better matrimonial prospects, after his polygamous father’s passing, and Urvashi, who plays the eccentric Ayisha who effectively keeps us on tenterhooks to find out if she’s his biological mother or not. Although the movie saw the light of the day now, Jose says the seed of the story took root in his mind during his film school (International Film School Sydney in Australia) days in 2012. “I started writing the story in 2015 and finished the first draft by early 2016. I then collaborated with my friend (débutante screenwriter) Sarath R Nath and we polished the script,” says Jose, who studied Computer Science engineering before entering tinsel town. The director had already cast Tovino and Urvashi in the key roles way before the former became the star he is now. “When I met Tovi on the sets ofEnnu Ninte Moideenand narrated the story to him, he liked it and committed himself to the project at once. As for Ayisha, I could recall no other face other than Urvashichechi’s,” he says. Bankrolling the project and Tovino’s subsequent jam-packed schedule delayed the production. Jose, who has previously assisted Marathi filmmaker Nikhil Mahajan and Lijo Jose Pellissery, says he chose such a theme as he “loves to understand and explore human relationships” and how they can be represented fruitfully on screen. “That’s what I look for in my reading too,” he says, mentioning M Mukundan, SK Pottekad and Vaikom Mohammad Basheer as some of his literary inspirations. Nailing the dialect Ente UmmantePerucaptures the look and feel of Thalassery in its essence, amply evinced in the Malabari dialect most of the characters converse in, and Jose points out that the scenes were shot where they were set. “I have a lot of friends from the Malabar belt and this helped nail the dialect while writing the dialogues. So the setting came to my mind quite naturally. However, we also did some research to get the backdrop accurate.” Having actors such as Mamukkoya and Hareesh Kanaaran who naturally have a north Kerala accent in the line-up only helped his cause. Thalassery, Kozhikode and Ponnani served as the main locations while he credits Spanish cinematographer Jordi Planell Closa for zooming in on some photogenic locales of Lucknow where Hameed’s quest takes him to. Jose says he was flexible with his script and tapped into “talented cast” for improvisations, especially in the humorous scenes, “to bring in the actors’ signature contributions” as well. As the dust settles, Jose is eager to move on to new projects, though, at this point, he prefers not to divulge any details. He, however, acknowledges that the success of his début has been “a massive confidence booster” to take up bigger, better projects.  When I met Tovi on the sets ofEnnu Ninte Moideenand narrated the story to him, he liked it and committed himself to the project at once. As for Ayisha, I could recall no other face other than Urvashichechi’s  Trump card In Batman and Robin, Batman pulls out his credit card in the audition scene. Its “good until” date reads FOREVER.|0|
MY BAGS ARE PACKED, I’M READY TO GO|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST| Zadar has often been outshone by its popular siblings — the charming city of Dubrovnik and party animals Split and Hvar. But those who have visited the port city of Zadar, will vouch that this is where you get gorgeous sunsets. Alfred Hitchcock was amazed by them. At the promenade, hear the lilting tunes from the Sea Organ. Steps lead into the water and those underwater have pipes that create music when waves snuggle up to them. These tunes and the cool breeze make you feel warm, fuzzy and melancholic, all at once. Then there is the installation by architect Nikola Bašić, called Greeting to the Sun. This 22-metre circular disc works on solar energy and emits dazzling lights in the evening. Some use it as a dance floor, others just laze on it, do yoga there or even use it as a romantic prop for proposals. Zadar also hosts music festivals and is a great base from where you can set off to explore national parks and islands. It is teeming with historical monuments such as Fosa, Rector’s Palace, Five Wells, Forum, etc. And you can let you hair down at Varos, a hip neighbourhood brimming with quirky bars. Don’t forget to try their maraschino, local cherry liqueur along with fresh catch from the sea.  Flamingo kitsch has been ruling the fashion world for almost two years now. If these winged wonders look so cool on clothes and accessories, imagine how awesome they’ll look in your holiday pictures. “Flamingos have become insanely popular in the last few years here in Aruba,” says Marcella Janczewski from the Visit Aruba team. They roost on Renaissance Island that has a huge fan following worldwide, thanks to selfies with the pretty pink birds that abound on social media. It is a private island and one needs to buy a day pass in advance. Recently, flamingos have also been introduced to De Palm Island. A day ticket is required here as well. This Dutch island in the Caribbean Sea is also known for its crystal-clear waters, where you can snorkel, sail, scuba dive, kite surf and be a beach bum. It’s sunny, windy and always warm here. “Don’t forget your sunscreen as we are close to the Equator and the sun is strong,” advises Marcella. In addition, she recommends visiting Arikok National Park, the Natural Pool, Bushiribana Gold Mill Ruins, Alto Vista Chapel... “There is a party any day or night of the week here. Wednesday to Sunday are the most popular nights for going out. Clubs, bars and lounges are all closely located (you can find many in the Palm Beach area) so it is easy to hop around. Some hotspots include Gusto Night Club, MooMba Beach Bar and Sand Bar,” says Marcella. Oranjestad is the capital of Aruba and the island nation is small enough to be covered in a day.  The colourful wooden houses of Kalamaja look as if they have stepped out of Noddy land. An area populated by fishermen since the 14th Century, this is now one of the coolest neighbourhoods in Tallinn. While the Old Town is always the most visited, areas such as Kalamaja and Rotermann, with avant garde architecture, are where the trendy, creative set can be spotted. The Telliskivi Creative City — located in a reclaimed factory area — with its eatery, boutiques, an antique book store, theatre and weekly dance nights and flea markets, is sought after. In addition, the city also has a growing number of spas. “Many cruise ships dock in Tallinn. In fact, that’s what brought in tourists around a decade ago,” says Thea Sepp, Information Specialist at the Tallinn Tourist Information Centre. “This year, we have received more than 300 cruise ships with about 6,00,000 tourists,” she adds. The Kohtuotsa viewing platform, Town Hall Square, St Olav’s church, St Catherine’s Passage, Seaplane Harbour and Town Wall find themselves on most sightseeing lists. The Song Festival Grounds is another favourite and the venue for the Estonian Song and Dance Festival that happens once in every five years. Luckily, it will take place this year in July and will feature thousands of dancers and choir performers.  This is one city where you may not feel broke. Don’t forget to get a relaxing massage or a hair spa treatment or even fake eyelashes here. It costs way less than India and the quality is commendable too. Hanoi sits by the Red River, embracing its age-old colonial monuments, temples, museum and mausoleum. It is also proud of its modern Lotte Tower, glitzy hotels and Nhat Tan Bridge. In the heart of the bustling city lies the tranquil Hoan Kiem Lake, one of the most photographed spots in the city. This is also where the Old Quarter is; a commercial area bustling with shops and nightlife. There are specific streets that sell kitchen ware, herbs, cotton, and so on. The tailors in Vietnam are known for their craft. Get a few outfits tailored while there, especially the Ao Dai, the local dress. Try the egg coffee, or the traditional coffee that comes with a generous serving of condensed milk. The variety of street food is mind-boggling. Frombanh mitobun cha, it’ll make sure you never go hungry. You can discover Hanoi by foot, or choose from limos, regular cabs, three-wheeled cycle rickshaws or even motorcycle taxis.  Everything in the Plaza de Espana in Seville has the power to make even the most mediocre photograph look exceptional. There is something magical about the architecture of this city, from the Gothic cathedral, the Giralda, the Alcazar with its Mudejar work, to the narrow lanes that cradle old-world bars and restaurants. It’s where ‘Despacito’ and ‘Chantaje’ are punctuated by the gallop of horses pulling carriages that look straight out of a fairy tale. The recent hot spot is the Metropol Parasol, a 26-metre-high wooden structure that resembles a giant waffle or a mushroom. Flamenco bars thrive in the neighbourhood of Triana that’s across the Guadalquivir river. The bars have more locals than tourists, and matching steps with them is nearly impossible. The dancing starts late by 10 pm and doesn’t stop till the wee hours of the morning. Local singers put up impromptu performances as people show off their Flamenco steps. This is way more fun than just sitting through a serious Flamenco performance.|0|
Slow and steady wins the race|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The hatchling swiftly makes his way to the Arabian Sea with determination and the agile movement of his tiny flippers. He embraces the foamy waves and swims away to begin a new life. He is one of the many baby green sea turtles born on Ras Al Jinz beach in Oman that night. Yet, he is one of the few that survived the dangerous journey from the nest to the water. Natural predators like dogs, foxes, birds and crabs add to the man-made global threat of extinction. It’s been over 150 million years since sea turtles first called oceans their home. Today, rampant hunting, relentless development of coastlines, fishing, marine pollution and the indiscriminate degradation of nesting beaches are threatening their survival. Humans ruthlessly continue to harvest turtles for their meat and shells and litter beaches and seas with plastic waste, glass bottles, cans, fishing ropes and lines. These are hazardous for the turtles that could die if they ate the garbage on the beach. All for conservation In such testing times, Ras Al Jinz Reserve, which was declared a reserve in 1996, is a shining example of continued turtle conservation. Along its 45-kilometre coastline, it protects sea turtles and their nesting sites. It is heartening that nearly 30,000 nestingchelonia mydasor green turtles visit this reserve each year. “During the hatching season, between October and November, nearly 1,30,000 turtles are born. Each year, we see the hatching of around 5,50,000 turtles,” states Vijay Handa, reserve general manager. Though green turtles are the main species that nest here, olive ridleys, loggerhead turtles and hawksbill turtles also swim to this beach. While the peak season for laying eggs is between June and September, Ras Al Jinz beach is the only place in the world where green turtles come every night to lay eggs through the year. Every night, at least one turtle lays her eggs on the beach. The reserve shares its success story with visitors via guided turtle-watching tours, which include both walk-ins, and guests who stay at the reserve’s 31 rooms and luxury eco-tents. For in-house guests, tours are included in their stay package. These awareness-generating and sensitising tours are conducted daily — at 4 am and 9 pm. Participants are briefed before the commencement of each tour by a ranger. Flashlights cannot be used once the nesting site is reached, guests should be with the ranger at all times and maintain silence to ensure that they do not disturb the creatures. “We also patrol the beach and baby turtles that lose their way are saved and returned to the sea,” adds Hameed, a ranger. Ras Al Jinz beach is reserved for turtle nesting. Camping, barbeques and picnics on the beach are strictly prohibited. Fishermen and local communities don’t mess with the dedicated rangers. They know they are on the radar with rangers monitoring them. “The range for baby turtles staying alive is three turtles from every 1,000. Due to the dedicated efforts of our staff, we’ve witnessed an average of five turtles out of 1,000 making it,” adds Handa with a hint of pride. Museum for turtles Another initiative of the Reserve is the turtle museum. It educates visitors in Arabic, English and German about the cultural importance of these marine beings. Many coastal people believe that sea turtles and fish were their ancestors. This belief holds true in Oman as well. While sea turtles find mention in Greek, Vietnamese, Japanese and Chinese mythology, countries of the Indian and Pacific Ocean took it a notch up by printing currency notes and stamps with sea turtles on them. In Indian mythology, in one of his incarnations, Lord Vishnu manifested himself as a turtle.  Did you know? * Marine turtles are toothless, and they have beaks that help them feed. * The sense of smell in turtles is as developed, if not more than that of dogs. * Turtles see the world in colour.  Nearly 30,000 nesting chelonia mydas or green turtles visit this reserve each year|0|
The lure of luxe|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Indians are travelling abroad like never before. According to the UN World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO), India will account for a record 50 million outbound tourists in 2020, a 100% jump from the current 25 million. Indians are also not shying away from spending on and demanding better services in the skies. They are looking for a lot more than a complimentary soup and a few breadsticks on board. What, you may ask? How about a zero-gravity seat in which you can rest your weary self through a long-haul flight? Some even offer mood-lighting, therapy sessions, and believe it or not, private suites! Leading the charge on this crusade to ‘better flying’ are airline companies from Asia and West Asia. Here are some of the most exclusive experiences that are up for offer 35,000 feet above the ground. The goodness of technology For a couple of decades now, Emirates has been convincing us persistently about their prowess as an innovative and luxurious carrier. Their new Boeing 777 liners set the bar pretty high for others. In fact, these flights are designed to make even economy travel a lot more comfortable than one would expect. The First and Business class suites are another deal altogether. Here, patrons have the advantage of walking into their very own private rooms. The novelty in each of these rooms is the inclusion of zero-gravity seats that are specially designed to emulate a feeling of weightlessness. Straight out of NASA, you may imagine. And rightly so. The soft, leathered seats and well-thought-through upholstery match the creature comforts offered by luxury hotels. Middle seats have the advantage of virtual windows that stream a live feed on a make-believe window, so you’re not missing out on anything. How cool is that? You’re also pampered with ambient mood lighting, temperature controls, a 32-inch HD LCD television, Safari binoculars, and an entertainment system with thousands of options. All in all, Emirates and Mercedes have endeavoured to offer the S-Class luxury up in the air. The elements inspired by Mercedes S-Class include the choice of material used, the quality of workmanship and the lighting system, within the First and Business class suites. Essa Sulaiman Ahmad, vice-president, India-Nepal, Emirates, describes it as thoughtful luxury. “This is the first time an Emirates product has been so influenced by another luxury brand, but it is a natural fit as both Emirates and Mercedes-Benz have the same unwavering commitment to fine detail, uncompromising quality, and a drive to push boundaries.” A therapeutic flight Cathay Pacific has got its luxury and passenger care right. Meditation comes to you, on a display screen during a long-haul flight. Cathay Pacific’s ‘Travel Well With Yoga’ ensures that passengers try yoga. The programme offers videos that can be played during flights. These are sprinkled with generous expert advice. The instructions are available in English, Cantonese, Mandarin, and Japanese. The entire programme is split into six easy-to-follow videos, in which Pure Yoga’s founding teacher Patrick Creelman and senior instructor and co-founder Almen Wong demonstrate routines designed to improve circulation, enhance joint mobility and relax the mind. Simon Cuthbert, who manages platforms and connectivity for the airliner, says, “We all know that sitting still for a long period of time can be uncomfortable. The need to get up, move and get your blood pumping is important during a flight. Yoga is an innovative way to do this. There are a series of exercises that can easily be done from an economy class seat, whilst other moves are suitable for after the flight in your hotel,” he says. Cabins for the dreamer First Class travel in Qatar Airways’ Qsuite offers customisable seating areas. Passengers can now use separator panels to adjust the way their partitions and seats are arranged. For instance, by moving partitions around, you could have a bedroom in the sky or a mini conference room if you want one. In addition to seating, even the screens are adjustable. It’s no surprise that the Qsuite was awarded the ‘Best Cabin Concept’, winning the coveted Crystal Cabin Award, a one-of-its-kind international award for excellence in aircraft interior innovation. “We are thrilled to be offering our loyal customers this unique product, which is unlike anything they have experienced before. The features that Qsuite offers provide the ultimate customisable travel experience that enables passengers to create an environment that suits their own needs,” said Qatar Airways Group chief executive, Akbar Al Baker. Rich in health While comfort, technological marvels, and unbelievable customisations are impressive, there’s nothing that comes close to gastronomic pleasures, and Etihad Airways has chosen this as the quickest way to its customers’ hearts. Their newly-introduced Weqaya menu, which quite literally translates to ‘prevention of illnesses’, is now available in business and first-class long-haul and ultra-long-haul outbound flights from Abu Dhabi and luxury lounges. The department of health was instrumental in putting this nutritious and one-of-its-kind menu together. Neerja Bhatia, vice-president–Indian Subcontinent, Etihad Airways, says, “With the addition of the Weqaya menu, we are extending our support to the department of health-Abu Dhabi, and offering an enhanced in-flight dining experience to guests, with more choices on-board.” Alaska Airlines offers its patrons virtual reality headsets and noise-cancelling headphones — because LED screens are so yesterday.

Secrets from the caverns|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|It is late afternoon. I am hungry, nursing a headache and contemplating the 400-odd steps I have to climb to explore a few caves. Sounds like an idea best abandoned. But I’m a lover of history and am egged on by an archaeologist who is ready to accompany and enlighten us on the treasures inside. We set off to explore the not-so-well-known Bedse Caves near Lonavala, Maharashtra and the early Buddhist rock-cut caves of Bhaja and Karla. Experts believe that before visiting the World Heritage sites of Ajanta and Ellora, one must visit these caves, considered an introductory chapter to them. These caves on hillocks are more than 2,000 years old and were the residence of monks who used to lived austere lives here. Enveloped in the beauty of the Western Ghats, every cave has its own charm and serenity, tailor-made for meditation and solitude. The ancient route  Archaeologist Sawani Shetye of the Goa-based Bhoomij Heritage group informs us that thousands of years ago, these caves lay on an ancient trade route, running eastward from the Arabian Sea into the Deccan. Traders used them as shelter on their travels. Our journey started from Pune to the Bhaja Caves, around 60 kilometres away. These are touristy but still convey a sense of peace when you visit them. Bhaja, a group of 22 rock-cut caves, is the best example of early Buddhist cave architecture dating back to the 2nd Century BC. The important cave is Cave XII, which has a beautiful wooden ceiling in a horseshoe shape, made of Burmese teak more than 2,000 years old. The hall or thechaityagrhahas pillars on both sides and astupaat its centre. A little ahead are a cluster ofstupaswhich are now covered with a roof. These contain relics and were built by the monks in memory of their gurus. However, what set apart these caves are the panels or sculptures on walls. They tell the story of the Sun god and Indra. Look out for the carving of a woman playing something that looks like an early version of the tabla! The latter half of the day was spent in the stunning Karla Caves. These caves developed from the 2nd Century BC to the 5th Century AD. Many traders and Satavahana rulers gave grants for the construction of these caves. The Grand Chaitya (Cave VIII) has massive pillars that have figures of males and females, mounted on animals such lions, elephants, etc. It also has astupain the centre. A 15-metre-high pillar stands at its entrance. A few centuries ago, there were two pillars, but now only one survives. There is the Ekvira temple here. No one knows for sure when this temple was constructed, but now it is a major pilgrimage site, especially for the Koli community of Maharashtra. Shetye informs us that these caves were situated not far from villages, as monks had to visit the village to gather alms. They had little comfort except the spectacular views. The Bedse Caves were built during the Satavahana period. Some of the caves appear to have been meditation halls and the acoustics suggest the same. The environment is perfect for meditation, what with the monsoon green as far as the eye can see and no other sound except the gurgle of waterfalls and the screams of the peacocks. And, of course, the calming silence.|0|
The art of a city|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Visakhapatnam’s location is enviable as it stands with the Eastern Ghats on one side and the deep blue Bay of Bengal on the other. And now, adding to its character are mindful greening initiatives and street art (courtesy Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation or GVMC). For three years now, Visakhapatnam has been on the list of top 10 cleanest cities under the Swachh Survekshan 2018 by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. This year it was ranked seventh. The art on the walls is interesting and eclectic and they add something special to the character of the city. On some walls are paintings of MK Gandhi with the message to keep the city clean, scenic stretches with wind mills and people cycling (to promote renewable energy) and other colourful depictions that captures biodiversity. On the Chinna Waltair Main Road, you will spot an elephant and a tiger, created out of a pile of rocks! All about the city Nidhi Jamwal, an environment journalist who recently visited the city to address the students of Damodaram Sanjivayya National Law University, said she found the city striking. “Its clean roads and well-maintained surroundings are notable and the colourfully painted walls provide visual relief and reflect the philosophy to keep the city clean.” The street art has also inspired BK Agrawal, a city-based photographer. He says loves capturing the images as he goes on his daily walk. “It feels like an art exhibition. The walls in the city no longer resemble ruins,” he quips. His personal favourites are the terracotta tribal art under the Aslimeta railway station flyover and the splashes of colour near the All India Radio office. Hoping GVMC will continue with the good work gynaecologist Sunti Polisetti who is a runner says the beautification drive has definitely changed mindsets. “People now think twice before littering and public urination has reduced significantly.” She hoped the slum areas in Visakhapatnam will receive the same love and care. Something for everyone On the Beach Road that is popular with tourists and locals alike for walking, there is a plantation of palm trees. Over three dozen trees provide shade on hot afternoons, besides making it a favourite spot for film shoots. Sunray Resorts has done it as part of its corporate social responsibility. Statues of political leaders line Beach Road. The walls behind the them are painted with colourful sea animals. The area is also home to the INS Kurusura Submarine Museum, Navy Aircraft Museum and the Visakha Museum. Other eco-friendly on the Beach Road include solar lighting, e scooters and cycles-on-rent. Students can contact the appropriate zonal officer from the GVMC website to submit their street art proposal.  “We encourage students to display their art. They can directly reach out to me or the zonal commissioner if they wish to do so. Street art has played a catalytic role in reducing unnecessary posters and the nuisance of public urination.”M Hari Narayanan GVMC commissioner  Celebrating craft through wall art There have been instances of wall art in the city before. But, in 2016, city-based artist Kanumuri Srinivasa Rao collaborated with HSBC Bank and a painted portion of the compound wall. Kanumuri says, “I wanted to pay a tribute to the leather puppet and Kalamkari artists of the State.” The painting shows scenes from a school, where the teachers are wearing Kalamari saris and suits. Kanumuri used acrylic paint to revamp 1285 square feet of the wall and the project took three months to be completed.  It’s huge In February 2018, Eduardo Kobra and his team made the largest spray paint mural of (approx) 62,000 sq ft for Cacua Show, a chocolate company in Sao Paulo, Brazil.|0|
PAST FORWARD|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|In its 16th edition, the Krishnakriti Art and Culture Festival turns the spotlight on the transformation of urban spaces, people and cultures. The theme ‘Urban Frames — visual practices and transitions’ has facilitated pan-Indian artists, architects, art historians, conservationists, photographers and other stakeholders to collaborate and present a spectrum of viewpoints. The core from which the exhibitions and workshops of Krishnakriti 2019 emerge are the vintage photographs and maps of Kalakriti Archives. The exhibitions will explore ideas of cosmopolitanism, pluralism and cultural exchange between different cities through visual arts. Here’s what to expect from some of them:|0|
Secrets from the caverns|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|It is late afternoon. I am hungry, nursing a headache and contemplating the 400-odd steps I have to climb to explore a few caves. Sounds like an idea best abandoned. But I’m a lover of history and am egged on by an archaeologist who is ready to accompany and enlighten us on the treasures inside. We set off to explore the not-so-well-known Bedse Caves near Lonavala, Maharashtra and the early Buddhist rock-cut caves of Bhaja and Karla. Experts believe that before visiting the World Heritage sites of Ajanta and Ellora, one must visit these caves, considered an introductory chapter to them. These caves on hillocks are more than 2,000 years old and were the residence of monks who used to lived austere lives here. Enveloped in the beauty of the Western Ghats, every cave has its own charm and serenity, tailor-made for meditation and solitude. The ancient route  Archaeologist Sawani Shetye of the Goa-based Bhoomij Heritage group informs us that thousands of years ago, these caves lay on an ancient trade route, running eastward from the Arabian Sea into the Deccan. Traders used them as shelter on their travels. Our journey started from Pune to the Bhaja Caves, around 60 kilometres away. These are touristy but still convey a sense of peace when you visit them. Bhaja, a group of 22 rock-cut caves, is the best example of early Buddhist cave architecture dating back to the 2nd Century BC. The important cave is Cave XII, which has a beautiful wooden ceiling in a horseshoe shape, made of Burmese teak more than 2,000 years old. The hall or thechaityagrhahas pillars on both sides and astupaat its centre. A little ahead are a cluster ofstupaswhich are now covered with a roof. These contain relics and were built by the monks in memory of their gurus. However, what set apart these caves are the panels or sculptures on walls. They tell the story of the Sun god and Indra. Look out for the carving of a woman playing something that looks like an early version of the tabla! The latter half of the day was spent in the stunning Karla Caves. These caves developed from the 2nd Century BC to the 5th Century AD. Many traders and Satavahana rulers gave grants for the construction of these caves. The Grand Chaitya (Cave VIII) has massive pillars that have figures of males and females, mounted on animals such lions, elephants, etc. It also has astupain the centre. A 15-metre-high pillar stands at its entrance. A few centuries ago, there were two pillars, but now only one survives. There is the Ekvira temple here.

Digital transitions|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|‘From Atom to Pixel’ by Nandan Ghiya Kalakriti Art Gallery, January 3 to 16 Jaipur-based Nandan Ghiya was at a residency programme with Kalakriti more than a year ago, during which he identified images from Kalakriti Archives that he’d like to work on. He tells us that he’s always enjoyed working on ‘found photographs’ and re-purposing or upcycling them to make them relevant in contemporary context. Nandan Ghiya’s grandfather was a studio photographer and there was no dearth of archival images while he was growing up. “Vintage images are a document of an era — of people’s clothing, lifestyles, and their culture. The downside of globalisation is how it has flattened the world, leading to a loss of distinct identities. Through photography, I look for what’s lost and document the transitions,” he explains. ‘From Atom to Pixel’ will showcase 34 images he’s worked on over a year and a half. The title is an allegory to the continuous shift in identities and cultures, since the time of early photographs to the digital pixels. While noticing the shifts, Nandan is also observant of how some things don’t change: “We adapt with changing times but deep within, retain our national, religious and other identities. My artistic search is to understand where we are heading,” he says, pointing out that beyond physical identities, we express ourselves differently on social media platforms. Nandan’s next project is in collaboration with Delhi-based The Alkazi Foundation For the Arts.|0|

Unearth jewels from a treasury|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST| Nature can be baffling, and how! In Loktak lake, you can stand on a piece of land that floats on water. Go boating in the largest freshwater lake in the Northeast and you will come across several floating swamps which are heterogeneous masses of vegetation, soil and organic matter. In the south-western part of the lake is located Keibul Lamjao National Park, probably the world’s largest floating park, which was declared a national park in 1977. If you are lucky you might get a glimpse of the reclusive Sangai here, the endangered brow-antlered deer, also the State animal of Manipur. The Sangai is also called the dancing deer because when it moves on the floating park, it appears to dance on the waters. The construction of the Ithai Barrage for the Loktak Hydro Electric Project, has altered the ecology of the lake. Designated as the Ramsar Wetland of International Importance, the lake is home to diverse flora and fauna, such as several species of aquatic plants, birds, and animals, including the Indian python. The lake is a lifeline for Manipur, especially for its fishermen.|0|
Kollywood: What lies ahead|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|If 2018 was a year of change for Kollywood, 2019 promises to see faster transformation in terms of film production and marketing. The superstars will continue to dominate the trade, expanding the market outside Tamil Nadu. One of the most significant trends of 2018 was the growth of Tamil films in the domestic market (excluding Tamil Nadu). Today, major Kannada and Malayalam producers have turned distributors for Tamil films in their home States. The Hindi dubbed version of Rajinikanth’s2.0grossed more than the Tamil version! The southern states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala are becoming a bigger market for certain Tamil stars. A few years back, 90% of the revenue for a big film came from Tamil Nadu. But today, the other states’ revenue for a Rajinikanth or a Vijay film is as high as 40% of the total sale of theatrical and other rights. Transcending boundaries The overseas market is also expanding. In the US,2.0’s theatrical revenue matched some of the big Bollywood films. Tamil films are now releasing in places like Poland, Russia and Ukraine. There are so many new players who are willing to pay extrafor the big hero films. In a year, the market value of a star’s film has almost doubled in the overseas sector. However, Tamil films are yet to crack the Chinese market. Will2.0manage to rake in the moolah in China when it releases in May 2019? China is all set to become the world’s biggest film market by 2021, overtaking the US, though it has its restrictions (only 34 foreign films a year). A few Bollywood films likeDangal,Secret Superstar,Bajrangi BhaijaanandHindi Mediumdid extraordinary business there. However, it witnessed a decline after recent failures likePadmanandThugs of Hindostan. The buzz is that2.0is likely to do decent business, considering howTransformers: The Last Knightdid extraordinary numbers in China. But China remains the last frontier for Tamil films, withMersalyet to be released. The South Indian films that had larger-than-life characters (theBaahubaliseries also received a lukewarm response) are yet to find acceptance among the Chinese masses. Winds of change What kind of content will Tamil cinema offer in 2019? Yes, there will be more films catering to multiplex audience since women-centric films have scored big last year. Rural-based stories have lost their charm outside the State. Still, you may find more caste-based themes in 2019. The rural entertainers laced with a strong message likeKadaikutty Singamwill continue to draw audiences in the B and C centres. Now, the big question is: what’s the case with smaller films featuring lesser-known actors? Producing a Tamil film is no longer easy, as finance has dried up and television channels have stopped buying small films (the satellite rights of Jyotika’sKaatrin Mozhiare yet to be sold). In addition, the Tamil Film Producers’ Council has disbanded its release regulation committee and it’s a free for all. Leading producer G Dhananjayan said, “In 2018, 95 small-budget films (less than Rs. 3 crore) were released, out of which onlyMerku Thodarchi Malaiworked critically and commercially. Most other films did not recover even the publicity expenses. Among films made in the Rs. 3-5 crore category, only five —Iruttu Araiyil Murattu Kuthu, Pyaar Prema Kaadhal, Pariyerum Perumal, U TurnandThuppakki Munai— worked commercially. It clearly indicates that small films have very limited opportunity to succeed.” Currently, the hot topic in Kollywood is the clash betweenPettaandViswasamthis Pongal. According to the trade, the release dates for the next three months have been locked by influential producers and distributors. Unlike previous years, the multiplexes will now call the shots Producers are now migrating to OTT platforms, which are slowly gaining momentum. 2019, in many ways, is going to be a landmark year as the production and business of Tamil films are going through a metamorphosis. Nevertheless, the show must go on.   Tamil films are now releasing in places like Poland, Russia and Ukraine. There are so many new players who are willing to pay extra for the big hero films.|0|

Mirroring us|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|All that time spent scrolling through social media posts is taking a toll. For some travellers, vacations don’t matter unless they are in picture-perfect spots that can be shared on social media platforms. Some mimic poses of their favourite celebrities, while a few others scout for similar accommodation. Results of a recent survey show the extent of social media stimulus on vacation and behaviour patterns of Indian travellers. Around 66% of Indian travellers surveyed by Booking.com stated that they see travel as a potential opportunity to earn a living as an influencer or travel blogger. The web portal’s travel predictions for 2019 reveals that social media will continue to impact the way we travel. Insights were gathered from over 163 million verified guest reviews, along with its research encompassing 21,500 travellers across 29 countries (1,000 from India). The results found seven in 10 Indian travellers to be excited about the prospect of space travel in 2019 and beyond, and are open to considering the experience themselves, while three in five travellers say they would rather stay in accommodation under the sea than in space. Further, the survey revealed that 53% of Indian travellers look at where celebrities stay and try to find accommodation that looks similar. In fact, 24% of Indian travellers try to re-create poses from one of their favourite celebs or Instagrammers. Giving in to the pressure of social media gratification, 30% respondents admitted to having posted an older, more flattering image from a previous holiday rather than from their current trip. And 42% have taken a picture of a different accommodation pretending they are staying there. About 63% want to stay in accommodation that will look good on social media, and 22% have pretended to still be on vacation when they are actually at home.|0|
The lure of luxe|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Indians are travelling abroad like never before. According to the UN World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO), India will account for a record 50 million outbound tourists in 2020, a 100% jump from the current 25 million. Indians are also not shying away from spending on and demanding better services in the skies. They are looking for a lot more than a complimentary soup and a few breadsticks on board. What, you may ask? How about a zero-gravity seat in which you can rest your weary self through a long-haul flight? Some even offer mood-lighting, therapy sessions, and believe it or not, private suites! Leading the charge on this crusade to ‘better flying’ are airline companies from Asia and West Asia. Here are some of the most exclusive experiences that are up for offer 35,000 feet above the ground. The goodness of technology For a couple of decades now, Emirates has been convincing us persistently about their prowess as an innovative and luxurious carrier. Their new Boeing 777 liners set the bar pretty high for others. In fact, these flights are designed to make even economy travel a lot more comfortable than one would expect. The First and Business class suites are another deal altogether. Here, patrons have the advantage of walking into their very own private rooms. The novelty in these rooms is the inclusion of zero-gravity seats that are specially designed to emulate a feeling of weightlessness. The soft, leathered seats and well-thought-through upholstery match the comforts offered by luxury hotels. Middle seats have the advantage of virtual windows that stream a live feed on a make-believe window, so you’re not missing out on anything. You’re also pampered with ambient mood lighting, temperature controls, a 32-inch HD LCD television, Safari binoculars, and an entertainment system with thousands of options. All in all, Emirates and Mercedes have endeavoured to offer the S-Class luxury up in the air. The elements inspired by Mercedes S-Class include the choice of material used, the quality of workmanship and the lighting system, within the First and Business class suites. Essa Sulaiman Ahmad, vice-president, India-Nepal, Emirates, describes it as thoughtful luxury. “This is the first time an Emirates product has been so influenced by another luxury brand, but it is a natural fit as both Emirates and Mercedes-Benz have the same unwavering commitment to fine detail, uncompromising quality, and a drive to push boundaries.” A therapeutic flight Cathay Pacific has got its luxury and passenger care right. Meditation comes to you, on a display screen during a long-haul flight. Cathay Pacific’s ‘Travel Well With Yoga’ ensures that passengers try yoga. The programme offers videos that can be played during flights. These are sprinkled with generous expert advice. The instructions are available in English, Cantonese, Mandarin, and Japanese. The entire programme is split into six easy-to-follow videos, in which Pure Yoga’s founding teacher Patrick Creelman and senior instructor and co-founder Almen Wong demonstrate routines designed to improve circulation, enhance joint mobility and relax the mind. Simon Cuthbert, who manages platforms and connectivity for the airliner, says, “The need to get up, move and get your blood pumping is important during a flight. Yoga is an innovative way to do this. There are a series of exercises that can easily be done from an economy class seat, whilst other moves are suitable for after the flight in your hotel,” he says. Cabins for the dreamer First Class travel in Qatar Airways’ Qsuite offers customisable seating areas. Passengers can now use separator panels to adjust the way their partitions and seats are arranged. For instance, by moving partitions around, you could have a bedroom in the sky or a mini conference room if you want one. In addition to seating, even the screens are adjustable. “We are thrilled to be offering our loyal customers this unique product, which is unlike anything they have experienced before. The features that Qsuite offers provide the ultimate customisable travel experience that enables passengers to create an environment that suits their own needs,” says Qatar Airways Group chief executive, Akbar Al Baker. Rich in health While comfort, technological marvels, and unbelievable customisations are impressive, there’s nothing that comes close to gastronomic pleasures, and Etihad Airways has chosen this as the quickest way to its customers’ hearts. Their newly-introduced Weqaya menu, which quite literally translates to ‘prevention of illnesses’, is now available in business and first-class long-haul and ultra-long-haul outbound flights from Abu Dhabi and luxury lounges. The department of health was instrumental in putting this nutritious and one-of-its-kind menu together. Neerja Bhatia, vice-president–Indian Subcontinent, Etihad Airways, says, “With the addition of the Weqaya menu, we are extending our support to the department of health-Abu Dhabi, and offering an enhanced in-flight dining experience to guests, with more choices on-board.” Alaska Airlines offers its patrons virtual reality headsets and noise-cancelling headphones — because LED screens are so yesterday.

Where women rule|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|“Ima, Ima, Ima!” You can’t imagine the number of times you will utter this word in Ima Keithel, but you will never get tired of it. Every time I said it, I felt elated. The charged atmosphere of Ima Keithel, (located in Khwairamband Bazaar), an iconic market housing 4,000 women shopkeepers, infuses you with energy.Imameans mother andkeithelmeans market. To see such a large number of women doing business under one roof is a rare sight in our country, but in Imphal it has been the norm, reportedly since the 16th Century. During Nupi Lan, women’s war in 1939, women traders of this market organised agitations against the local ruler and the Britishers, challenging their oppressive economic and political policies. I had first heard of the word ‘Ima’ in 2004 after 12 ‘Imas’ stripped to protest the rape and murder of Thangjam Manorama. These powerful businesswomen dressed in their traditional attire —phanik(sarong) andinniphis(worn over the blouse) — trade in all commodities from vegetables, meats and household utensils, to jewellery, bags, clothes and more.|0|

Self love|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST| Keto diets done, zumba done, green juice done and dusted. Wellness in 2019 is going to look at more of self-love. Be it eating healthy or looking good, the focus is on learning to love oneself, despite the “flaws”. Resolving emotional issues, eating healthy, maintaining a balance in emotions, going on digital detoxes to devote more time for oneself, meditation, are all part of self-care. Self-love as a trend, is on the rise, says wellness experts. Journalling, accepting your body the way it is, are all ways to self-love. The thrust now is not so much on weight-loss, but on cultivating a positive body image.|0|
A few good tunes|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The quality of Bollywood music continued on a downward spiral in 2018 but the multi-composer soundtracks and remixes kept going north. In fact, this was the year that even biggies like A.R. Rahman and Amit Trivedi got sucked into the multi-composer vortex. One little silver lining, though, has been the ease in compiling the top songs for the year. However, if not for some soundtracks bolstering the scene in the second half of 2018 even a reasonable number of picks would have been difficult to make. Here are the 18 that stood out in 2018. Hallaa (Manmarziyaan) Composer Amit Trivedi’s busiest year to date was also a rather middling one for most part, until he reunited with the man who gave him his first break, Anurag Kashyap. While the characteritsic repetitiveness of Trivedi was a problem here too, there was more than enough great music on offer.‘Halla’,written by Shellee, is my pick for the pulsating orchestration, Jyoti Nooran’s rendition and alsofor the moment in the movie when the song appears. Dilbaro (Raazi) The most popular song fromRaaziand quite deservedly so; SEL and Gulzar build a beautiful“bidaai”song around a traditional Kashmiri wedding piece. Harshdeep Kaur takes care of the rest, with brief but effective cameos from Vibha Saraf and Shankar Mahadevan. Bol Ke Lab (Manto) The most exciting aspect about the Nandita Das film, at least to me, was the return of Sneha Khanwalkar, that too in style. In this song, Faiz’s powerful poetry gets a raag yaman-flavoured melody from the composer. She has two classical exponents — Rashid Khan and Vidya Shah — singing it and adorns it with a rich backdrop of strings, harmonium and clarinets. Aaj Se Teri (Pad Man) Among singers, Arijit Singh had the best year; as if in contradicting the (misplaced) criticism that he sings the same kind of songs. My favourite from the Arijit range is this beauty by Amit Trivedi and Kausar Munir, based on raag bhimplaasi that the composer has employed well in the past too. Naino Waale Ne (Padmaavat) One of the best things about Sanjay Leela Bhansali movies is the visual representation of songs. It was surprising therefore that the best song ofPadmaavatnever even made it to the screen. Neeti Mohan leads this lovely melody that takes on the occasional wistful tone with the raag darbari Kanada flavoured cues on sitar. Bohot Dukha Mann (Mukkabaaz) Composer Rachita Arora, who showed promise in her debut last year (Newton), continued to deliver it. In this melancholic classical-flavoured piece written by Hussain Haidry, she doubles up as a singer alongside Dev Arijit, and does a fabulous job at that. Aahista (Laila Majnu) With this soundtrack co-composed with Joi Barua and Alif, sitar exponent Niladri Kumar had everyone wishing he would make more music in Hindi movies. In this song (written by Irshad Kamil, sung by Jonita Gandhi and Arijit Singh), Kumar literally takes you on a romantic journey across the Kashmir valley. Dhadak (Dhadak) The problem with remakes is that you find yourself hard-pressed not to keep comparing them with the original work. Even taking that into account, the title song ofDhadak(remake of Nagraj Manjule’s Marathi hitSairat) holds up admirably. It is hard not to fall in love with Ajay Atul’s lush violins and haunting tune, delivered by Ajay Gogavle and Shreya Ghoshal. Andhadhun (Andhadhun) While Amit Trivedi produced a competent set of songs for Sriram Raghavan inAndhadhun, my favourite still remains the guest composition by Raftaar and Girish Nakod. The piano and percussion-heavy (always a sucker for Marathi percussion!) title song perfectly captures the heady rush of the ride that the movie turns out to be. Grey Walaa Shade (Manmarziyaan) A song that, in addition to introducing the lead pair’s romance onscreen, turns out to be emblematic of the movie itself. It is replete with Amit Trivedi’s trademark quirkiness, further accentuated by the dancing twins that appear in the song’s video. Nagri Nagri (Manto) Shankar Mahadevan delivers this piece that, in keeping with the movie’s setting, carries a melody and a style of rendition that is evocative of the ’40s. Composer Sneha Khanwalkar does, however, by her own admission, get cheeky with the arrangement with some electronic elements finding their way towards the end. That does not in any way take away from the song’s appeal. Chaav Laga (Sui Dhaaga) The team that gave us ‘Moh Moh Ke Dhaage’ (Dum Lagaa Ke Haishaa) two years back reunited inSui Dhaagato deliver another simple yet beautiful piece, the wonderful Ronkini Gupta being the only addition on the vocal front this time. Mere Naam Tu (Zero) While the reviews of the movie have been mixed, what everyone appears to agree on is how well this song has been depicted on screen. An incredible melody backed by Ajay Atul’s trademark sweeping orchestration and a fabulous Bollywood playback debut for Abhay Jodhpurkar. Naina Banjaare (Pataakha) Vishal Bhardwaj-Gulzar soundtrack for the movie was an uncharacteristically short one and not as top notch as their previous albums. In this song the duo gets everything right, with ample help from Arijit of course. A gem that in its light-heartedness takes my mind back to‘Dil Toh Bachcha Hai Ji’fromIshqiya. Mujhe Chaand Pe Le Chalo (Sanju) A.R. Rahman was more active in the South this year, his two songs forSanju’ssix-song soundtrack being the only Bollywood contributions. The shoddy visual treatment the song received might have something to do with it not becoming particularly popular, but there is no denying the brilliance of this dreamy, sensual piece written by Irshad Kamil sung with a fitting verve by Nikhita Gandhi. Raazi (Raazi) SEL have given us a lot of anthemic pieces over time; in Meghna Gulzar’sRaazi, the trio alongside Gulzar and Arijit Singh, channel their soundscape fromMirzyato produce this wonderfully earthy motivational piece.  Ishq Di Baajiyaan(Soorma) Soorma’s music may not sit too well in the combined portfolio of SEL and Gulzar but is still quite an enjoyable one; this folksy piece (where Diljit Dosanjh gets behind the mic) mostly so.  Heartquake (Karwaan) Composer Anurag Saikia’s promising entry into mainstream Bollywood went largely under the radar, possibly because all the movies he has been involved in so far were multi-composer. Two of those came from director Akarsh Khurana, and it is in this light and quirky track written by Khurana himself, that Saikia delivers his best of the year.|0|
Mirroring us|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|All that time spent scrolling through social media posts is taking a toll. For some travellers, vacations don’t matter unless they are in picture-perfect spots that can be shared on social media platforms. Some mimic poses of their favourite celebrities, while a few others scout for similar accommodation. Results of a recent survey show the extent of social media stimulus on vacation and behaviour patterns of Indian travellers. Around 66% of Indian travellers surveyed by Booking.com stated that they see travel as a potential opportunity to earn a living as an influencer or travel blogger. The web portal’s travel predictions for 2019 reveals that social media will continue to impact the way we travel. Insights were gathered from over 163 million verified guest reviews, along with its research encompassing 21,500 travellers across 29 countries (1,000 from India). The results found seven in 10 Indian travellers to be excited about the prospect of space travel in 2019 and beyond, and are open to considering the experience themselves, while three in five travellers say they would rather stay in accommodation under the sea than in space. Further, the survey revealed that 53% of Indian travellers look at where celebrities stay and try to find accommodation that looks similar. In fact, 24% of Indian travellers try to re-create poses from one of their favourite celebs or Instagrammers. Giving in to the pressure of social media gratification, 30% respondents admitted to having posted an older, more flattering image from a previous holiday rather than from their current trip. And 42% have taken a picture of a different accommodation pretending they are staying there. About 63% want to stay in accommodation that will look good on social media, and 22% have pretended to still be on vacation when they are actually at home.|0|
Song of the Warbler|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The highlight of the year end Kerala Bird Race 2018, held in the city and moffusil areas, on December 30, was the sighting of the rare Eastern Orphean Warbler (Sylvia crassirostris) at Kalappara near Thattekkad, by Ginu George. This is only the second sighting from Ernakulam. The previous sighting was in 2007. Birdwatchers and nature enthusiasts from Ernakulam, Thrissur, Alappuzha, Malappuram, Idukki and Tamil Nadu actively took part in the 12th edition of this annual event. This year a total of 247 species of birds were recorded as opposed to 200 species last year.Around 10,740 individual birds were encountered as opposed to 5920 last year. The birds sighted include 14 species of raptors (Greater Spotted Eagle, Rufous Bellied Eagle, Crested Goshawk, Crested Honey Buzzard), seven species of woodpeckers including the Greater Flameback. The largest number of a species sighted was 1000 Lesser Whistling Duck.  The warbler’s liroo-liroo   The eastern Orphean warbler (Sylvia crassirostris) is a typical warbler of the genus Sylvia. This species occurs in summer around the Mediterranean and is a migratory wintering in sub Saharan Africa.   At 15–16 cm length its song is a series of warblingliroo-lirooand scolding notes.

In the right direction|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Jose Sebastian is pleased that his “dream of directing a film” has come true. His directorial début,Ente Ummante Peru, has struck an emotional chord with the audience for its often humorous and heart-warming portrayal of a young man’s search for his mother after his father’s demise. “I was quite confident aboutEnte Ummante Perudoing well but was also equally nervous since it’s my début,” says the 31-year-old with a laugh over phone from Ernakulam. The focal point of the film is the chemistry between Tovino Thomas, who plays Hameed, a shy guy who goes on a quest to shed hisyatheem(orphan) status, initially, for better matrimonial prospects, after his polygamous father’s passing, and Urvashi, who plays the eccentric Ayisha who effectively keeps us on tenterhooks to find out if she’s his biological mother or not. Although the movie saw the light of the day now, Jose says the seed of the story took root in his mind during his film school (International Film School Sydney in Australia) days in 2012. “I started writing the story in 2015 and finished the first draft by early 2016. I then collaborated with my friend (débutante screenwriter) Sarath R Nath and we polished the script,” says Jose, who studied Computer Science engineering before entering tinsel town. The director had already cast Tovino and Urvashi in the key roles way before the former became the star he is now. “When I met Tovi on the sets ofEnnu Ninte Moideenand narrated the story to him, he liked it and committed himself to the project at once. As for Ayisha, I could recall no other face other than Urvashichechi’s,” he says. Bankrolling the project and Tovino’s subsequent jam-packed schedule delayed the production. Jose, who has previously assisted Marathi filmmaker Nikhil Mahajan and Lijo Jose Pellissery, says he chose such a theme as he “loves to understand and explore human relationships” and how they can be represented fruitfully on screen. “That’s what I look for in my reading too,” he says, mentioning M Mukundan, SK Pottekad and Vaikom Mohammad Basheer as some of his literary inspirations. Nailing the dialect Ente UmmantePerucaptures the look and feel of Thalassery in its essence, amply evinced in the Malabari dialect most of the characters converse in, and Jose points out that the scenes were shot where they were set. “I have a lot of friends from the Malabar belt and this helped nail the dialect while writing the dialogues. So the setting came to my mind quite naturally. However, we also did some research to get the backdrop accurate.” Having actors such as Mamukkoya and Hareesh Kanaaran who naturally have a north Kerala accent in the line-up only helped his cause. Thalassery, Kozhikode and Ponnani served as the main locations while he credits Spanish cinematographer Jordi Planell Closa for zooming in on some photogenic locales of Lucknow where Hameed’s quest takes him to. Jose says he was flexible with his script and tapped into “talented cast” for improvisations, especially in the humorous scenes, “to bring in the actors’ signature contributions” as well. As the dust settles, Jose is eager to move on to new projects, though, at this point, he prefers not to divulge any details. He, however, acknowledges that the success of his début has been “a massive confidence booster” to take up bigger, better projects.  When I met Tovi on the sets ofEnnu Ninte Moideenand narrated the story to him, he liked it and committed himself to the project at once. As for Ayisha, I could recall no other face other than Urvashichechi’s  Trump card In Batman and Robin, Batman pulls out his credit card in the audition scene. Its “good until” date reads FOREVER.|0|

My bags are packed, I’m ready to go|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST| Zadar has often been outshone by its popular siblings — the charming city of Dubrovnik and party animals Split and Hvar. But those who have visited the port city of Zadar, will vouch that this is where you get gorgeous sunsets. Alfred Hitchcock was amazed by them. At the promenade, hear the lilting tunes from the Sea Organ. Steps lead into the water and those underwater have pipes that create music when waves snuggle up to them. These tunes and the cool breeze make you feel warm, fuzzy and melancholic, all at once. Then there is the installation by architect Nikola Bašić, called Greeting to the Sun. This 22-metre circular disc works on solar energy and emits dazzling lights in the evening. Some use it as a dance floor, others just laze on it, do yoga there or even use it as a romantic prop for proposals. Zadar also hosts music festivals and is a great base from where you can set off to explore national parks and islands. It is teeming with historical monuments such as Fosa, Rector’s Palace, Five Wells, Forum, etc. And you can let you hair down at Varos, a hip neighbourhood brimming with quirky bars. Don’t forget to try their maraschino, local cherry liqueur along with fresh catch from the sea.  Flamingo kitsch has been ruling the fashion world for almost two years now. If these winged wonders look so cool on clothes and accessories, imagine how awesome they’ll look in your holiday pictures. “Flamingos have become insanely popular in the last few years here in Aruba,” says Marcella Janczewski from the Visit Aruba team. They roost on Renaissance Island that has a huge fan following worldwide, thanks to selfies with the pretty pink birds that abound on social media. It is a private island and one needs to buy a day pass in advance. Recently, flamingos have also been introduced to De Palm Island. A day ticket is required here as well. This Dutch island in the Caribbean Sea is also known for its crystal-clear waters, where you can snorkel, sail, scuba dive, kite surf and be a beach bum. It’s sunny, windy and always warm here. “Don’t forget your sunscreen as we are close to the Equator and the sun is strong,” advises Marcella. In addition, she recommends visiting Arikok National Park, the Natural Pool, Bushiribana Gold Mill Ruins, Alto Vista Chapel... “There is a party any day or night of the week here. Wednesday to Sunday are the most popular nights for going out. Clubs, bars and lounges are all closely located (you can find many in the Palm Beach area) so it is easy to hop around. Some hotspots include Gusto Night Club, MooMba Beach Bar and Sand Bar,” says Marcella. Oranjestad is the capital of Aruba and the island nation is small enough to be covered in a day.  The colourful wooden houses of Kalamaja look as if they have stepped out of Noddy land. An area populated by fishermen since the 14th Century, this is now one of the coolest neighbourhoods in Tallinn. While the Old Town is always the most visited, areas such as Kalamaja and Rotermann, with avant garde architecture, are where the trendy, creative set can be spotted. The Telliskivi Creative City — located in a reclaimed factory area — with its eatery, boutiques, an antique book store, theatre and weekly dance nights and flea markets, is sought after. In addition, the city also has a growing number of spas. “Many cruise ships dock in Tallinn. In fact, that’s what brought in tourists around a decade ago,” says Thea Sepp, Information Specialist at the Tallinn Tourist Information Centre. “This year, we have received more than 300 cruise ships with about 6,00,000 tourists,” she adds. The Kohtuotsa viewing platform, Town Hall Square, St Olav’s church, St Catherine’s Passage, Seaplane Harbour and Town Wall find themselves on most sightseeing lists. The Song Festival Grounds is another favourite and the venue for the Estonian Song and Dance Festival that happens once in every five years. Luckily, it will take place this year in July and will feature thousands of dancers and choir performers.  This is one city where you may not feel broke. Don’t forget to get a relaxing massage or a hair spa treatment or even fake eyelashes here. It costs way less than India and the quality is commendable too. Hanoi sits by the Red River, embracing its age-old colonial monuments, temples, museum and mausoleum. It is also proud of its modern Lotte Tower, glitzy hotels and Nhat Tan Bridge. In the heart of the bustling city lies the tranquil Hoan Kiem Lake, one of the most photographed spots in the city. This is also where the Old Quarter is; a commercial area bustling with shops and nightlife. There are specific streets that sell kitchen ware, herbs, cotton, and so on. The tailors in Vietnam are known for their craft. Get a few outfits tailored while there, especially the Ao Dai, the local dress. Try the egg coffee, or the traditional coffee that comes with a generous serving of condensed milk. The variety of street food is mind-boggling. Frombanh mitobun cha, it’ll make sure you never go hungry. You can discover Hanoi by foot, or choose from limos, regular cabs, three-wheeled cycle rickshaws or even motorcycle taxis.  Everything in the Plaza de Espana in Seville has the power to make even the most mediocre photograph look exceptional. There is something magical about the architecture of this city, from the Gothic cathedral, the Giralda, the Alcazar with its Mudejar work, to the narrow lanes that cradle old-world bars and restaurants. It’s where ‘Despacito’ and ‘Chantaje’ are punctuated by the gallop of horses pulling carriages that look straight out of a fairy tale. The recent hot spot is the Metropol Parasol, a 26-metre-high wooden structure that resembles a giant waffle or a mushroom. Flamenco bars thrive in the neighbourhood of Triana that’s across the Guadalquivir river. The bars have more locals than tourists, and matching steps with them is nearly impossible. The dancing starts late by 10 pm and doesn’t stop till the wee hours of the morning. Local singers put up impromptu performances as people show off their Flamenco steps. This is way more fun than just sitting through a serious Flamenco performance.|0|

But there is one more which is loved and appreciated by everyone across Manipur — theshumang leela. College student Konsam Henry says if he were to choose between a popular Manipuri film and ashumang leelashow, he would choose the latter. A form of folk theatre,shumang leelais performed to live music by either an all-male cast (who play women’s roles too) or an all-women cast callednupi shumang leela,and occasionally transgenders too.

The waters beckon|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The Muziris Heritage Project (Kerala Tourism) in partnership with Jellyfish Watersports is set to hold a two-day kayaking expedition ‘Muziris Paddle 2019’ on January 5 and 6, 2019. Shilpika Gautam, world record holder of paddling the entire Ganga, international paddler Jim Bush from Perth, actor Revati, and other expert paddlers will grace the event. The event will be flagged off from the Kottapuram Jetty in Kodungalloor district and end at Bolgatty Island in Kochi. Being touted as one of Kerala’s most incredible nature experiences the event targets domestic and international tourists, paddling enthusiasts, people from all walks of life, children and even non-swimmers. Muziris, once a bustling seaport and the heart of the historic spice route used to be the key trade point between southern India and rest of the world. The region is dotted with numerous monuments of a bygone era that is more than 3,000 years old. Participants will get an opportunity to visit the legendary Muziris heritage sites on the way. The paddling event promotes the usage of our rivers for recreational usage and creates a connection to the river with youngsters and tourists. The kayakers will cover, overall, a distance of 40 km traversing through rivers, backwaters and important Muziris destinations en route. Each day they will cover an easy distance of 20 km with several strategic breaks for sightseeing and greeting locals. Participants will learn skills from expert trainers and river guides. “Muziris Paddle is a great way to experience Kerala through its water bodies and be part of the growing eco and responsible tourism initiatives.

How 2018 streamed it right|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|2018 was the year when streaming platforms became the new buzzword, due to the ability to watch shows and movies anytime, anywhere. It was also the year streaming platforms got a lot of Indian content. We check out some of the shows that dominated our screens last year for reasons, good and bad. Black Mirror Netflix inverted the storytelling paradigm with the standalone episode,Bandersnatch, with a series of interactive options that let users participate in the show. Set in 1984, the simple story of a geeky computer addict building an interactive game is filled with choices for the audience to make, from generic ones such as which cereal to choose for breakfast to complex ones that determine the lives of the characters on screens. Netflix also makes a cameo in this episode, and the format works very well, since the audience also keeps second-guessing the next move of the protagonists. The interactive element does not distract one from the story and makes you feel more involved. Netflix’s latest season ofBlack Mirrorwas also quite good. Instead of featuring absurd high-end tech, the focus pivoted to the human side of interacting with tech and the consequences it brings about. The Haunting of Hill House What’s new about another horror mini-series featuring a family in an old haunted home?The Haunting of Hill Housepacks in horror, a lot of mystery, some intrigue and throws in dysfunctional family dynamics for good measure. The story of the Crain family is showcased across parallel time lines, one set during their stay in the ‘most haunted house in America’ and the other in the present day. The horror is not as much in the ghosts, plenty of whom hang out in the backdrop. It is in the terse relationship among the primary characters, as they try to get their lives into order. Hill House is a character in its own right, and not just a place where the family happens to run into ghosts. The beauty is that it makes you feel like you are part of the action. Though the pace slackens a bit towards the end, this was one of the best horror series on streaming platforms this year. Nanette by Hannah Gadsby, Comicstaan and other comic specials Stand-up comedy shows were a huge draw on streaming platforms last year. In June, stand-up comedian Hannah Gadsby’sNanette, which dealt with a wide gamut of issues, ranging from identity to gender norms, was deeply poignant and offered a new perspective on topics generally brushed under the carpet. It was not perhaps funny in the conventional sense, but succeeded in striking a chord with the audiences. Closer home, Amazon Prime’sComicstaan, a comedy reality show, was a fun watch. It introduced many talented comedians and gave the audience a chance to appreciate relatively lesser-known genres of comedy. Sacred Games This was the first big Indian Netflix original series, featuring an ensemble cast of Saif Ali Khan, Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Radhika Apte. The series, an adaptation of Vikram Chandra’s book by the same name, basically deals with Saif Ali Khan playing a policeman trying to save Mumbai from an unknown threat, aided by Apte. The star cast is excellent, Nawazuddin and Apte shine, and the writing is taut. Ghoul The Radhika Apte thriller/horror/political drama tries to be too many things at one time and that brings about its failing.Ghoulbegins as a political thriller, set in a not-so-distant future, where right-wing radicals take over the country and cart off anyone opposed to their ideology to torture camps. Apte, an intelligence officer, betrays her professor father and ends up in one of the camps as the interrogator. A demonic force manages to make its way to the camp. Only three episodes long,Ghouldoes not get the audience involved. Breathe and Mirzapur Breathehad superb performances by Amit Sadh and Madhavan and tries its best to be a racy thriller. However, the plot is flimsy and seems contrived. It lacks a good background story. In the best shows, even secondary characters manage to catch your eye and keep you riveted. That does not happen inBreathe.Mirzapur,set in the badlands of North India, is an interesting tale of power and ambition.|0|

The director had already cast Tovino and Urvashi in the key roles way before the former became the star he is now. “When I met Tovi on the sets ofEnnu Ninte Moideenand narrated the story to him, he liked it and committed himself to the project at once. As for Ayisha, I could recall no other face other than Urvashichechi’s,” he says. However, bankrolling the project and Tovino’s subsequent jam-packed schedule delayed the production. Jose, who has previously assisted Marathi filmmaker Nikhil Mahajan and Lijo Jose Pellissery, says he chose such a theme as he “loves to understand and explore human relationships” and how they can be represented fruitfully on screen. “That’s what I look for in my reading too,” he says, mentioning M Mukundan, SK Pottekad and Vaikom Mohammad Basheer as some of his literary inspirations. Nailing the dialect Ente UmmantePerucaptures the look and feel of Thalassery in its essence, amply evinced in the Malabari dialect most of the characters converse in, and Jose points out that the scenes were shot where they were set. “I have a lot of friends from the Malabar belt and this helped nail the dialect while writing the dialogues. So the setting came to my mind quite naturally. However, we also did some research to get the backdrop accurate.” Having actors such as Mamukkoya and Hareesh Kanaaran who naturally have a north Kerala accent in the line-up only helped his cause. Thalassery, Kozhikode and Ponnani served as the main locations while he credits Spanish cinematographer Jordi Planell Closa for zooming in on some photogenic locales of Lucknow and its surroundings where Hameed’s quest takes him to. Jose says he was flexible with his script and tapped into his “talented cast” for improvisations, especially in the humorous scenes, “to bring in the actors’ signature contributions” as well. As the dust settles, Jose is eager to move on to new projects, though, at this point, he prefers not to divulge any details. He, however, acknowledges that the success of his début has been “a massive confidence booster” to take up bigger, better projects.  When I met Tovi on the sets ofEnnu Ninte Moideenand narrated the story to him, he liked it and committed himself to the project at once. As for Ayisha, I could recall no other face other than Urvashichechi’s  Trump card InBatman and Robin, Batman pulls out his credit card in the audition scene. Its “good until” date reads FOREVER.|0|
The art of a city|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Visakhapatnam’s location is enviable as it stands with the Eastern Ghats on one side and the deep blue Bay of Bengal on the other. And now, adding to its character are mindful greening initiatives and street art (courtesy Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation or GVMC). For three years now, Visakhapatnam has been on the list of top 10 cleanest cities under the Swachh Survekshan 2018 by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. This year it was ranked seventh. The art on the walls is eclectic and adds something special to the character of the city. On some walls are paintings of MK Gandhi with the message to keep the city clean, scenic stretches with wind mills and people cycling (to promote renewable energy) and other colourful depictions that captures biodiversity. On the Chinna Waltair Main Road, you will spot an elephant and a tiger, created out of a pile of rocks! All about the city Nidhi Jamwal, an environment journalist who recently visited the city to address the students of Damodaram Sanjivayya National Law University, said she found the city striking. “Its clean roads and well-maintained surroundings are notable and the colourfully painted walls provide visual relief and reflect the philosophy to keep the city clean.” The street art has also inspired BK Agrawal, a city-based photographer. He says loves capturing the images as he goes on his daily walk. “It feels like an art exhibition. The walls in the city no longer resemble ruins,” he quips. His personal favourites are the terracotta tribal art under the Aslimeta railway station flyover and the splashes of colour near the All India Radio office. Hoping GVMC will continue with the good work gynaecologist Sunti Polisetti who is a runner says the beautification drive has definitely changed mindsets. “People now think twice before littering and public urination has reduced significantly.” She hoped the slum areas in Visakhapatnam will receive the same love and care. Something for everyone On the Beach Road that is popular with tourists and locals alike for walking, there is a plantation of palm trees. Over three dozen trees provide shade on hot afternoons, besides making it a favourite spot for film shoots. Sunray Resorts has done it as part of its corporate social responsibility. Statues of political leaders line Beach Road. The walls behind the them are painted with colourful sea animals. The area is also home to the INS Kurusura Submarine Museum, Navy Aircraft Museum and the Visakha Museum. Other eco-friendly on the Beach Road include solar lighting, e scooters and cycles-on-rent. Students can contact the appropriate zonal officer from the GVMC website to submit their street art proposal.  “We encourage students to display their art. They can directly reach out to me or the zonal commissioner if they wish to do so. Street art has played a catalytic role in reducing unnecessary posters and the nuisance of public urination.”M Hari Narayanan GVMC commissioner  Celebrating craft through wall art There have been instances of wall art in the city before. In 2016, city-based artist Kanumuri Srinivasa Rao collaborated with HSBC Bank and a painted portion of the compound wall. Kanumuri says, “I wanted to pay a tribute to the leather puppet and Kalamkari artists of the State.” The painting shows scenes from a school, where the teachers are wearing Kalamari saris and suits. Kanumuri used acrylic paint to revamp 1285 square feet of the wall and the project took three months to be completed.  It’s huge In February 2018, Eduardo Kobra and his team made the largest spray paint mural of (approx) 62,000 sq ft for Cacua Show, a chocolate company in Sao Paulo, Brazil.|0|

The lure of luxe|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Indians are travelling abroad like never before. According to the UN World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO), India will account for a record 50 million outbound tourists in 2020, a 100% jump from the current 25 million. Indians are also not shying away from spending on and demanding better services in the skies. They are looking for a lot more than a complimentary soup and a few breadsticks on board. What, you may ask? How about a zero-gravity seat in which you can rest your weary self through a long-haul flight? Some even offer mood-lighting, therapy sessions, and believe it or not, private suites! Leading the charge on this crusade to ‘better flying’ are airline companies from Asia and West Asia. Here are some of the most exclusive experiences that are up for offer 35,000 feet above the ground. The goodness of technology For a couple of decades now, Emirates has been convincing us persistently about their prowess as an innovative and luxurious carrier. Their new Boeing 777 liners set the bar pretty high for others. In fact, these flights are designed to make even economy travel a lot more comfortable than one would expect. The First and Business class suites are another deal altogether. Here, patrons have the advantage of walking into their very own private rooms. The novelty in these rooms is the inclusion of zero-gravity seats that are specially designed to emulate a feeling of weightlessness. The soft, leathered seats and well-thought-through upholstery match the comforts offered by luxury hotels. Middle seats have the advantage of virtual windows that stream a live feed on a make-believe window, so you’re not missing out on anything. You’re also pampered with ambient mood lighting, temperature controls, a 32-inch HD LCD television, Safari binoculars, and an entertainment system with thousands of options. All in all, Emirates and Mercedes have endeavoured to offer the S-Class luxury up in the air. The elements inspired by Mercedes S-Class include the choice of material used, the quality of workmanship and the lighting system, within the First and Business class suites. Essa Sulaiman Ahmad, vice-president, India-Nepal, Emirates, describes it as thoughtful luxury. “This is the first time an Emirates product has been so influenced by another luxury brand, but it is a natural fit as both Emirates and Mercedes-Benz have the same unwavering commitment to fine detail, uncompromising quality, and a drive to push boundaries.” A therapeutic flight Cathay Pacific has got its luxury and passenger care right. Meditation comes to you, on a display screen during a long-haul flight. Cathay Pacific’s ‘Travel Well With Yoga’ ensures that passengers try yoga. The programme offers videos that can be played during flights. These are sprinkled with generous expert advice. The instructions are available in English, Cantonese, Mandarin, and Japanese. The entire programme is split into six easy-to-follow videos, in which Pure Yoga’s founding teacher Patrick Creelman and senior instructor and co-founder Almen Wong demonstrate routines designed to improve circulation, enhance joint mobility and relax the mind. Simon Cuthbert, who manages platforms and connectivity for the airliner, says, “The need to get up, move and get your blood pumping is important during a flight. Yoga is an innovative way to do this. There are a series of exercises that can easily be done from an economy class seat, whilst other moves are suitable for after the flight in your hotel,” he says. Cabins for the dreamer First Class travel in Qatar Airways’ Qsuite offers customisable seating areas. Passengers can now use separator panels to adjust the way their partitions and seats are arranged. For instance, by moving partitions around, you could have a bedroom in the sky or a mini conference room if you want one. In addition to seating, even the screens are adjustable. “We are thrilled to be offering our loyal customers this unique product, which is unlike anything they have experienced before. The features that Qsuite offers provide the ultimate customisable travel experience that enables passengers to create an environment that suits their own needs,” says Qatar Airways Group chief executive, Akbar Al Baker. Rich in health While comfort, technological marvels, and unbelievable customisations are impressive, there’s nothing that comes close to gastronomic pleasures, and Etihad Airways has chosen this as the quickest way to its customers’ hearts. Their newly-introduced Weqaya menu, which quite literally translates to ‘prevention of illnesses’, is now available in business and first-class long-haul and ultra-long-haul outbound flights from Abu Dhabi and luxury lounges. The department of health was instrumental in putting this nutritious and one-of-its-kind menu together. Neerja Bhatia, vice-president–Indian Subcontinent, Etihad Airways, says, “With the addition of the Weqaya menu, we are extending our support to the department of health-Abu Dhabi, and offering an enhanced in-flight dining experience to guests, with more choices on-board.” Alaska Airlines offers its patrons virtual reality headsets and noise-cancelling headphones — because LED screens are so yesterday.

Secrets from the caverns|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|It is late afternoon. I am hungry, nursing a headache and contemplating the 400-odd steps I have to climb to explore a few caves. Sounds like an idea best abandoned. But I’m a lover of history and am egged on by an archaeologist who is ready to accompany and enlighten us on the treasures inside. We set off to explore the not-so-well-known Bedse Caves near Lonavala, Maharashtra and the early Buddhist rock-cut caves of Bhaja and Karla. Experts believe that before visiting the World Heritage sites of Ajanta and Ellora, one must visit these caves, considered an introductory chapter to them. These caves on hillocks are more than 2,000 years old and were the residence of monks who used to lived austere lives here. Enveloped in the beauty of the Western Ghats, every cave has its own charm and serenity, tailor-made for meditation and solitude. The ancient route  Archaeologist Sawani Shetye of the Goa-based Bhoomij Heritage group informs us that thousands of years ago, these caves lay on an ancient trade route, running eastward from the Arabian Sea into the Deccan. Traders used them as shelter on their travels. Our journey started from Pune to the Bhaja Caves, around 60 kilometres away. These are touristy but still convey a sense of peace when you visit them. Bhaja, a group of 22 rock-cut caves, is the best example of early Buddhist cave architecture dating back to the 2nd Century BC. The important cave is Cave XII, which has a beautiful wooden ceiling in a horseshoe shape, made of Burmese teak more than 2,000 years old. The hall or thechaityagrhahas pillars on both sides and astupaat its centre. A little ahead are a cluster ofstupaswhich are now covered with a roof. These contain relics and were built by the monks in memory of their gurus. However, what set apart these caves are the panels or sculptures on walls. They tell the story of the Sun god and Indra. Look out for the carving of a woman playing something that looks like an early version of the tabla! The latter half of the day was spent in the stunning Karla Caves. These caves developed from the 2nd Century BC to the 5th Century AD. Many traders and Satavahana rulers gave grants for the construction of these caves. The Grand Chaitya (Cave VIII) has massive pillars that have figures of males and females, mounted on animals such lions, elephants, etc. It also has astupain the centre. A 15-metre-high pillar stands at its entrance. A few centuries ago, there were two pillars, but now only one survives. There is the Ekvira temple here. No one knows for sure when this temple was constructed, but now it is a major pilgrimage site, especially for the Koli community of Maharashtra. Shetye informs us that these caves were situated not far from villages, as monks had to visit the village to gather alms. They had little comfort except the spectacular views. The Bedse Caves were built during the Satavahana period. Some of the caves appear to have been meditation halls and the acoustics suggest the same. The environment is perfect for meditation, what with the monsoon green as far as the eye can see and no other sound except the gurgle of waterfalls and the screams of the peacocks. And, of course, the calming silence.|0|
In full bloom|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|When Sunil Kumar and Anila V visited a plant nursery in the city in 2007, one flowering species caught their attention. Finding its asking price “too high”, the couple, however, returned home empty-handed. But the passionate gardeners found their thoughts going back to the “forbidden fruit” and soon yielded to temptation, thus buying their first Adenium Obesum. “Unlike other plants we have grown, we found that Adenium or Desert Rose has a unique charm. With its unusual caudex (swollen base), the fascinating shapes the plant can develop into was a great attraction. Slowly, we started buying more Adenium varieties from various nurseries around and the search extended across the country when it became an obsession,” says Sunil. Clearly, their endeavour has come up roses. Today, the couple has virtually converted the terrace of their white-walled, one-storey house in Kazhakkoottam into a blooming nursery of Adeniums of all kinds. They also maintain a large poly-house at Anila’s place in Ayoor, Kollam district. Propagated mostly through grafting, their collection boasts over 120 flowering varieties, when both original and hybrid ones are taken into account. Peak efflorescence “The motto for Adeniums is: less water, more sunlight. Don’t love them a lot by watering daily. When you water them, do it thoroughly and wait for the medium (soil) to be completely dry before the next turn,” advises Sunil. The couple recollect coming back from vacations to find some of their other plants wilted while the Adeniums welcomed them with plenty of flowers. Unsurprisingly, Adeniums here shed their blossom during monsoon and reach peak efflorescence during the period from January to May in line with the State’s climatic conditions. With its origins in the Arabian Peninsula, the Adenium genus seems to have found its way into the South-East Asian culture for its colourful appeal. “It’s not really a fragrant species but is extremely flexible, both in terms of growing as well as floral varieties. Through grafting, virtually a large number of petal shades can be developed. In some countries, such as Taiwan, Thailand and some part of China, Adeniums holds a certain degree of sacredness, just like our thulasi,” says Sunil, who runs an outlet in Pangappara that exclusively sells Adeniums, cacti and succulents. Original Adeniums bear pink flowers and are commonly used as “rootstocks” during grafting, where a small stem portion of a hybrid is cut and attached to the rootstock, which is then kept in the shade until growth from the new stem is spotted. Hybrid varieties can come in single petals or multi petals and the flowers take a wide range of shades like red, blackish red, white, yellow, purple or striped ones. However, what colour and form a hybrid variety takes can only be confirmed after it blossoms. Sunil, thus, advises a prospective Adenium growers to never buy seedlings without seeing the parent flower first. Trained into shapes One distinctive feature of Adeniums is that they can be grown into desired shapes by “training.” Like, Adenium Arabicum, a pliable variety that develops a beautiful canopy in bonsai form. It can be meticulously root-trained into ‘tower form’ with elongated trunks. “Usually, bonsais are grown by way of slow and controlled growth. Arabicums are natural bonsais and hence grow relatively quicker in amusing shapes,” points out Anila, a techie. Another hot favourite with Adenium aficionados for bonsai is Thai Socotranum, which has abundant branching. The most common variety, Adenium Obesum, however, requires pruning. Nevertheless, maintenance is no bed of roses. Sunil has sourced varieties of saplings from as far as Thailand. “Bare-rooted ones can be shipped and they won’t die like most other plants,” he says. The couple’s hobby extends beyond the Adeniums, evident from the array of succulents, agaves, aloe hybrids and some rare cacti specimens such as Astrophytum (Living rock), Gymnocalcium, Mammillaria varieties and Echinocactus surrounding their house. In fact, some of the Adeniums and cacti that have adorned flower shows in the city came straight from Sunil’s gardens. Price starts from Rs. 250 for Adenium Obesum and Rs. 350 for Arabicum. Arabicum Thai Socotranum, perhaps the rarest in Sunil’s collection, comes at Rs. 20,000.Contact: 9946201969  Know the difference Sunil says while the most common variety, Adenium Obesum, is a “lovers’ choice” for the exquisite flowers they produce, Arabicum is a “bonsai lovers’ choice.” While hundreds of hybrids and flower varieties can be developed using Obesum, Arabicum usually produces only a kind of pink flower in varying sizes depending on the variety   Dos and don’ts  The medium (soil) used should be porous and ideally comprise 40% of river sand, 40% organic manure or vermicompost and 20% red earth or cocopeat. Adeniums cannot tolerate water-logging. It is usually a pot plant and is grown as bonsai. However, a proper growing medium or a hilly landscape may help if one wants to plant them on the ground, explains Sunil. The caudex fattens over time as the plant grows and may require re-potting into a larger one accordingly. Regular inspection is of paramount importance as pests such as mealybugs and spider mites can attack the plants. Sunil recommends that the leaves must ideally be kept as clean as much possible to prevent pest attacks.

Feet of endurance|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|When two youngsters from the city gushed about their trip to Italy for a coastline walk, architect Liza Natarajan was not impressed. Instead, the city-based Liza told them about her coastline walk that had taken her from the lighthouse in Vypeen island in Kochi to the lighthouse in Chettuva, near Guruvayur, and, prior to that, her walk from Tangassery lighthouse in Kollam to the one in Kovalam in Thiruvananthapuram. “They assumed that beaches in Kerala are dirty. I described the beautiful beach at Valapad in Thrissur, the gentle waves, the wealth of birds to watch and the clean sands,” says Liza with a laugh. On December 25, 2018, she along with her nephew Arjun A and designer Medha Bhatt walked 82 km from Vypeen light house to the one at Chettuva, near Guruvayur, in three days. Years ago, a classmate of Liza’s would often tell her school friends how she had walked all the way from the lighthouse at Tangassery to the lighthouse at Kovalam, nearly 80-plus km along the beach. At estuaries, water bodies and road-less stretches, they would be ferried across by friendly boatmen who knew the waters like the back of their hand. Liza had often wished she could emulate her friend. But as the sea came closer to the land, seawalls were put up in some places and beaches were swallowed by the sea in some other places. “Although it sounded so beautiful, it did not seem doable now,” says Liza. That is when Yamuna Sunny, a geographer who is into cartography, told Liza that it was possible even today as she had walked along the coast during her student days. Three musketeers “That was enough for me to put on my walking shoes. My friend Girija Krishnaswamy, a teacher of business administration in Australia, pitched in. And I roped in my nephew, 25-year-old architect, Arjun,” she recalls. On Christmas Day in 2017, Liza along with Girija and Arjun took a train from the city to Kollam. They visited the lighthouse at Tangassery and began the walk from there. On the first day, they touched base at Anchuthengu lighthouse and stayed at Kappil. Their next stop was at Kadinamkulam and on the third day, they reached the lighthouse at Kovalam. “We were too adventurous on the first trip. We discovered that at places like Pozhikkara, for instance, the river is too wide and we could not cross it without the help of a boat. Water travel has fallen out of favour in these parts with the proliferation of bridges and roads and so we could not find anyone to ferry us over. So we had to walk all the way to the bridge to cross the river and get back to the beach again. That was extremely tiring and increased the distance,” recalls Liza. Walking on the sand was exhausting and strenuous. “We discovered that near the shoreline, the sand is compacted and so it is easier to walk on. Moreover, the waves lapping at your feet is a beautiful sensation,” says Arjun. Moreover, some stretches of the beach like the one around VSSC has been cordoned off and even locals are not allowed there. So they had to take a detour of about four km to go inland and come again to the beach. While Taj Kovalam permitted them to walk along their beach, another well-known resort, one of the oldest in Kovalam, did not give them permission. “The last leg of our walk in 2017 was not pleasant owing to these restrictions. But this year, it was magical,” she says. Initially, the plan was to walk from Tangassery lighthouse to the one at Alappuzha. But then they found that the rough sea and the tsunami had resulted in seawalls on a number of places. Moreover, the tide would be high during the time of Christmas owing to the lunar phase at that time. So they decided to walk from Vypeen to Chettuva. Medha joined them from Vadodara. “Although I had doubts if I could do it, Liza motivated me and I jumped in for the adventure,” says Medha. Of the three-day trip, the first day was smooth going what with groves of casuarina trees near the beach and time to shoot the breeze. Halting at Munnambam fishing harbour for the night, they resumed the journey at dawn. It was on the second day that they saw some breathtaking sights near Valapad beach. But the trio could not help notice the damage caused by the incursions of the sea and the sand. As the sea came closer to the seawall, the waves crashed against the walls and the sand was flung against the wall and beyond it. “We saw sand dunes created by the accumulation of sand and some of the sand had to be removed from the coastal roads to prevent it from being inundated. I have never seen anything like it,” says Liza. By the end of the third day, when they reached their destination and climbed the lighthouse at Chettuva, all they felt was elation at having covered the distance. “The take-aways are many from a trip like this. Till I went for these walks, my idea of a beach was Shanghumugham, Kovalam and so on... all highly commercialised. Some of the places we walked through were so deserted and peaceful. These walks revealed another picture of our coastline: fragile, beautiful and teeming with different kinds of creatures,” says Arjun. He adds: “The scene keeps shifting every few km: the vegetation and even the colour of the sand. Many marine creatures make their home on the shoreline and it was fascinating to see the patterns they had made on the sand. The number of birds we saw was amazing.” And now the trio is waiting to go on the next coastline walk, this time to leave their footprints on the beaches in Malabar.  Walk the walk  Don’t be all at sea. Here are tips the trio said would make such trips easier:   They had planned their walk with the help of Google maps. Planning where to break thejourney and stay for the night helped them book their rooms well in advance.  Full-sleeved cotton clothes, sun cream, hats and footwear.   Travel light.  Start at the crack of dawn after a heavy breakfast.  vignettes of coastal trails  “There were many memorable visuals and incidents on our trip, some beautiful, some very painful and sad. Out of a still pond, I saw a cormorant break through the water and gracefully take to the sky. It was a memorable visual. Another one I saw was at Valapad beach. I saw waves of white moving along the beach; colonies of seagulls on the beach. we stopped and watched the scene for a long time. “What touched our hearts was the sight of abandoned houses in tsunami colonies near the beach, especially near Azheekode. Sand had swamped many houses, some of which were not even damaged. Residents in the locality told us that the owners were forced to abandon the houses owing to the accumulation of sand. In some places, it was heartbreaking and frightening to see the ferocious face of the sea. The beach was non-existent and the sea was almost lapping at the narrow coastal roads.” Medha Bhatt  Guiding light The Tower of Hercules in Spain is the oldest surviving lighthouse in the world. Records show that it has existed since at least the second century AD. It is a UNESCO World Heritage site.|0|

The best of world cinema in 2018|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Cinema can breed a peculiar rapaciousness—the more you feed on images, the more voracious your appetite becomes. In a year where I could feast on a lot more than usual, I still couldn’t savour a bunch — Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck’sNever Look Away, Benedikt Erlingsson'sWoman At War, Marcelo Martinessi’sThe Heiresses, Tamara Jenkins’Private Lifeto name just a few. These five films, however, were singular, and united, in laying bare the human condition and examining individuals and relationships with immense profundity, astuteness and wisdom. They were also, coincidentally, about families and sororities. Alfonso Cuaron’s ‘Roma’ It’s common to fall in love with a film but rare to get swept over by one.Romahas been that exception. Having viewed it thrice in as many months, on the big screen, as Alfonso Cuaron meant it to be seen, my impressions remain scattered, incoherent, grappling to find the right words. There is much that overwhelms. Cuaron’s intensely personal love letter to his nanny, that he has said to have made with memory as a tool, is indeed like a reverie on screen. Like it happens in a dream there is precision and geometry of arrangement to every luminous black and white image; the feeling, however, may not be as easily explicable, if not entirely evasive. Be it the foreground or the background, there is persistent activity that fills the seemingly placid frames even as the narrative moves from one caringly mapped-out situation to another.  Cuaron keeps rocking the bourgeoisie boat ever so gently. Here dogs and maids belong to same order in the hierarchy; in fact the dead dogs of the houses are perhaps better remembered with their stuffed heads bizarrely displayed as trophies on walls. The daily chores, the day’s work for Cleo never seem to end; one image flows into the other and even the most banal of shots has a place in the larger human story that Cuaron wants to tell. Disparities are bridged yet stay well-defined. Yet, divisions also make way for strange connects. The seemingly empowered, Sofia shares a destiny akin to that of the hapless Cleo. Both are united in facing similar betrayals at the hands of uncaring men. One is an irresponsible wimp, the other basks in the faux glory of masculinity. “Women, we are always alone,” Sofia tells Cleo. They may both seem feeble, fragile and alone but will find a way. As many women like them eventually do. There is still more toRoma.It’s not just Cuaron’s critical gaze into male entitlement and his own privileged world but he also casts a wider look at the violent unrest outside in the country. The film is seamless in knitting together personal upheavals and political, social and cultural agitations into a nuanced whole with the personal and political, gender and class atrocities coming together direly in the persona of Fermin. Romais a sweeping, all-embracing tale about the intensely tragic turbulences that creep up in life, leave you shaken but also stronger and more resilient. There are films that serenade you for a while,Romais a keeper. Barry Jenkins’ ‘If Beale Street Could Talk’ Barry Jenkins creates glorious romance on screen in a manner reminiscent of Wong Kar Wai. However, the lyrical moments of togetherness, the languid images are grounded in the unfair, ugly reality of racism and concomitant inequities. The tale of a young girl fighting to get her wrongfully confined lover out of jail before the birth of their first childBeale Streetis about separation and desperation and yet a perseverance and persistence of devotion. Only Jenkins could have looked at the fractious issue of race relations in this characteristic gentle, genteel and abundantly graceful way. Underlined with the hope that, “our children can be free”. Hirokazu Kore-eda’s ‘Shoplifters’Are families a biological inheritance or can we cobble them together as we move along in life? It’s a complex thought that lies at the core of a seemingly simpleShoplifters. A family of thieves takes a little girl, who has been hurt and abused in her home, under its wings. Will this love and affection that comes from her new parents and siblings last a lifetime or remain just a short tryst? Only certainty is a deep sense of loneliness and alienation. Nuri Bilge Ceylan’s ‘The Wild Pear Tree’ Textured and rivetingly shot in long takes, resting heavy on several probing conversations and resounding metaphors (like the persistent digging of a well), Nuri Bilge Ceylan’s ode to fathers and sons is the unheralded masterpiece of 2018. A young man returns home from college only to find it hard to fit back in to the family that has been battling with the debts of his father. He has his own worries about the future—being a writer and a teacher but without a job for the moment. Ceylan questions the family but also sees the futility of entirely negating it. Sons after all inherit from their fathers, a lineage is as much about ruptures as continuities. He also dwells on the centrality of religion and the conservatism lurking underneath the liberal veneer in the young. The young protagonist’s search for direction also becomes a reflection of the larger unrest in Turkey. A densely layered film,The Wild Pear Treepacks a lot in its quiet images. Yorgos Lanthimos’s ‘The Favourite’Three scorching women at its core and men turned perfunctory, the delectable tale of a strange sorority—Queen Anne, her confidant and advisor Duchess of Marlborough Sarah Churchill, and Sarah’s cousin Abigail Hill—is the most refreshingly wicked and irreverent film of the year. The ladies are brutally immoral, ambitious, manipulative and transgressive but not once does the filmmaker, or the audience, turn judgmental. The Anne, Sarah and Abigail triangle is less about love and affection, more about deceit and betrayals because relationships here are not sacred, merely a tool used for political one-upmanship. Lanthimos’ women are not just survivors but have a sharp killer instinct and believe firmly in the adage—self above everyone else.|0|

How 2018 streamed it right|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|2018 was the year when streaming platforms became the new buzzword, due to the ability to watch shows and movies anytime, anywhere. It was also the year streaming platforms got a lot of Indian content. We check out some of the shows that dominated our screens last year for reasons, good and bad. Black Mirror Netflix inverted the storytelling paradigm with the standalone episode,Bandersnatch, with a series of interactive options that let users participate in the show. Set in 1984, the simple story of a geeky computer addict building an interactive game is filled with choices for the audience to make, from generic ones such as which cereal to choose for breakfast to complex ones that determine the lives of the characters on screens. Netflix also makes a cameo in this episode, and the format works very well, since the audience also keeps second-guessing the next move of the protagonists. The interactive element does not distract one from the story and makes you feel more involved. Netflix’s latest season ofBlack Mirrorwas also quite good. Instead of featuring absurd high-end tech, the focus pivoted to the human side of interacting with tech and the consequences it brings about. The stand-out episodes were ‘Hang the DJ’, a story of computer simulations trying to work out the perfect match. Another episode, featuring a pack of robotic dogs hunting down people in an apocalyptic wasteland, also struck a chord and is a wee bit scary, especially after watching robotic dogs open a door with relative ease in a Boston lab. The Haunting of Hill House What’s new about another horror mini-series featuring a family in an old haunted home?The Haunting of Hill Housepacks in horror, a lot of mystery, some intrigue and throws in dysfunctional family dynamics for good measure. The story of the Crain family is showcased across parallel time lines, one set during their stay in the ‘most haunted house in America’ and the other in the present day. The horror is not as much in the ghosts, plenty of whom hang out in the backdrop. It is in the terse relationship among the primary characters, as they try to get their lives into order. Hill House is a character in its own right, and not just a place where the family happens to run into ghosts. The beauty is that it makes you feel like you are part of the action. Though the pace slackens a bit towards the end, this was one of the best horror series on streaming platforms this year. Nanette by Hannah Gadsby, Comicstaan and other comic specials Stand-up comedy shows were a huge draw on streaming platforms last year. In June, stand-up comedian Hannah Gadsby’sNanette, which dealt with a wide gamut of issues, ranging from identity to gender norms, was deeply poignant and offered a new perspective on topics generally brushed under the carpet. It was not perhaps funny in the conventional sense, but succeeded in striking a chord with the audiences. Closer home, Amazon Prime’sComicstaan, a comedy reality show, was a fun watch. It introduced many talented comedians and gave the audience a chance to appreciate relatively lesser-known genres of comedy. Zakir Khan’s hilarious take inKaksha Gyarviwas also funny and nostalgic. Sacred Games This was the first big Indian Netflix original series, featuring an ensemble cast of Saif Ali Khan, Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Radhika Apte. The series, an adaptation of Vikram Chandra’s book by the same name, basically deals with Saif Ali Khan playing a policeman trying to save Mumbai from an unknown threat, aided by Apte. The star cast is excellent, Nawazuddin and Apte shine, and the writing is taut. Split into parallel narratives, the storyline kept us hooked initially, especially the evolution of Gaitonde from small-time goon to a don. However, the pace slackens off in the latter half and the frequent flashbacks mean that it is very tough to feel invested in any of the characters, especially the minor ones. Ghoul The Radhika Apte thriller/horror/political drama tries to be too many things at one time and that brings about its failing.Ghoulbegins as a political thriller, set in a not-so-distant future, where right-wing radicals take over the country and cart off anyone opposed to their ideology to torture camps. Apte, an intelligence officer, betrays her professor father and ends up in one of the camps as the interrogator. A demonic force manages to make its way to the camp. Only three episodes long,Ghouldoes not get the audience involved. Breathe and Mirzapur Breathehad superb performances by Amit Sadh and Madhavan and tries its best to be a racy thriller. However, the plot is flimsy and seems contrived. It lacks a good background story. In the best shows, even secondary characters manage to catch your eye and keep you riveted. That does not happen inBreathe.Mirzapur,set in the badlands of North India, is an interesting tale of power and ambition. It is engaging and is helmed beautifully by Pankaj Tripathi. There is a lot of violence and this is not for the faint-hearted.|0|
Control the tides of self-belief|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Start the new year with a new mindset. Learn how to overcome negative thoughts and build a clear vision at an hour long Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) workshop by Priya Jain, a Hyderabad-based psychologist.

My bags are packed, I’m ready to go|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST| Zadar has often been outshone by its popular siblings — the charming city of Dubrovnik and party animals Split and Hvar. But those who have visited the port city of Zadar, will vouch that this is where you get gorgeous sunsets. Alfred Hitchcock was amazed by them. At the promenade, hear the lilting tunes from the Sea Organ. Steps lead into the water and those underwater have pipes that create music when waves snuggle up to them. These tunes and the cool breeze make you feel warm, fuzzy and melancholic, all at once. Then there is the installation by architect Nikola Bašić, called Greeting to the Sun. This 22-metre circular disc works on solar energy and emits dazzling lights in the evening. Some use it as a dance floor, others just laze on it, do yoga there or even use it as a romantic prop for proposals. Zadar also hosts music festivals and is a great base from where you can set off to explore national parks and islands. It is teeming with historical monuments such as Fosa, Rector’s Palace, Five Wells, Forum, etc. And you can let you hair down at Varos, a hip neighbourhood brimming with quirky bars. Don’t forget to try their maraschino, local cherry liqueur along with fresh catch from the sea.  Flamingo kitsch has been ruling the fashion world for almost two years now. If these winged wonders look so cool on clothes and accessories, imagine how awesome they’ll look in your holiday pictures. “Flamingos have become insanely popular in the last few years here in Aruba,” says Marcella Janczewski from the Visit Aruba team. They roost on Renaissance Island that has a huge fan following worldwide, thanks to selfies with the pretty pink birds that abound on social media. It is a private island and one needs to buy a day pass in advance. Recently, flamingos have also been introduced to De Palm Island. A day ticket is required here as well. This Dutch island in the Caribbean Sea is also known for its crystal-clear waters, where you can snorkel, sail, scuba dive, kite surf and be a beach bum. It’s sunny, windy and always warm here. “Don’t forget your sunscreen as we are close to the Equator and the sun is strong,” advises Marcella. In addition, she recommends visiting Arikok National Park, the Natural Pool, Bushiribana Gold Mill Ruins, Alto Vista Chapel... “There is a party any day or night of the week here. Wednesday to Sunday are the most popular nights for going out. Clubs, bars and lounges are all closely located (you can find many in the Palm Beach area) so it is easy to hop around. Some hotspots include Gusto Night Club, MooMba Beach Bar and Sand Bar,” says Marcella. Oranjestad is the capital of Aruba and the island nation is small enough to be covered in a day.  The colourful wooden houses of Kalamaja look as if they have stepped out of Noddy land. An area populated by fishermen since the 14th Century, this is now one of the coolest neighbourhoods in Tallinn. While the Old Town is always the most visited, areas such as Kalamaja and Rotermann, with avant garde architecture, are where the trendy, creative set can be spotted. The Telliskivi Creative City — located in a reclaimed factory area — with its eatery, boutiques, an antique book store, theatre and weekly dance nights and flea markets, is sought after. In addition, the city also has a growing number of spas. “Many cruise ships dock in Tallinn. In fact, that’s what brought in tourists around a decade ago,” says Thea Sepp, Information Specialist at the Tallinn Tourist Information Centre. “This year, we have received more than 300 cruise ships with about 6,00,000 tourists,” she adds. The Kohtuotsa viewing platform, Town Hall Square, St Olav’s church, St Catherine’s Passage, Seaplane Harbour and Town Wall find themselves on most sightseeing lists. The Song Festival Grounds is another favourite and the venue for the Estonian Song and Dance Festival that happens once in every five years. Luckily, it will take place this year in July and will feature thousands of dancers and choir performers.  This is one city where you may not feel broke. Don’t forget to get a relaxing massage or a hair spa treatment or even fake eyelashes here. It costs way less than India and the quality is commendable too. Hanoi sits by the Red River, embracing its age-old colonial monuments, temples, museum and mausoleum. It is also proud of its modern Lotte Tower, glitzy hotels and Nhat Tan Bridge. In the heart of the bustling city lies the tranquil Hoan Kiem Lake, one of the most photographed spots in the city. This is also where the Old Quarter is; a commercial area bustling with shops and nightlife. There are specific streets that sell kitchen ware, herbs, cotton, and so on. The tailors in Vietnam are known for their craft. Get a few outfits tailored while there, especially the Ao Dai, the local dress. Try the egg coffee, or the traditional coffee that comes with a generous serving of condensed milk. The variety of street food is mind-boggling. Frombanh mitobun cha, it’ll make sure you never go hungry. You can discover Hanoi by foot, or choose from limos, regular cabs, three-wheeled cycle rickshaws or even motorcycle taxis.  Everything in the Plaza de Espana in Seville has the power to make even the most mediocre photograph look exceptional. There is something magical about the architecture of this city, from the Gothic cathedral, the Giralda, the Alcazar with its Mudejar work, to the narrow lanes that cradle old-world bars and restaurants. It’s where ‘Despacito’ and ‘Chantaje’ are punctuated by the gallop of horses pulling carriages that look straight out of a fairy tale. The recent hot spot is the Metropol Parasol, a 26-metre-high wooden structure that resembles a giant waffle or a mushroom. Flamenco bars thrive in the neighbourhood of Triana that’s across the Guadalquivir river. The bars have more locals than tourists, and matching steps with them is nearly impossible. The dancing starts late by 10 pm and doesn’t stop till the wee hours of the morning. Local singers put up impromptu performances as people show off their Flamenco steps. This is way more fun than just sitting through a serious Flamenco performance.|0|
Mirroring us|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|All that time spent scrolling through social media posts is taking a toll. For some travellers, vacations don’t matter unless they are in picture-perfect spots that can be shared on social media platforms. Some mimic poses of their favourite celebrities, while a few others scout for similar accommodation. Results of a recent survey show the extent of social media stimulus on vacation and behaviour patterns of Indian travellers. Around 66% of Indian travellers surveyed by Booking.com stated that they see travel as a potential opportunity to earn a living as an influencer or travel blogger. The web portal’s travel predictions for 2019 reveals that social media will continue to impact the way we travel. Insights were gathered from over 163 million verified guest reviews, along with its research encompassing 21,500 travellers across 29 countries (1,000 from India). The results found seven in 10 Indian travellers to be excited about the prospect of space travel in 2019 and beyond, and are open to considering the experience themselves, while three in five travellers say they would rather stay in accommodation under the sea than in space. Further, the survey revealed that 53% of Indian travellers look at where celebrities stay and try to find accommodation that looks similar. In fact, 24% of Indian travellers try to re-create poses from one of their favourite celebs or Instagrammers. Giving in to the pressure of social media gratification, 30% respondents admitted to having posted an older, more flattering image from a previous holiday rather than from their current trip. And 42% have taken a picture of a different accommodation pretending they are staying there. About 63% want to stay in accommodation that will look good on social media, and 22% have pretended to still be on vacation when they are actually at home.|0|
18 earworms of 2018|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The quality of Bollywood music continued on a downward spiral in 2018 but the multi-composer soundtracks and remixes kept going north. In fact, this was the year when even biggies like AR Rahman and Amit Trivedi got sucked into the multi-composer vortex. One little silver lining, though, has been the ease in compiling the top songs for the year. However, if not for some soundtracks bolstering the scene in the second half of 2018 even a reasonable number of picks would have been difficult to make. Here are the 18 that stood out in 2018. ‘Hallaa’ (Manmarziyaan) Composer Amit Trivedi’s busiest year to date was also a rather middling one for most part, until he reunited with the man who gave him his first break, Anurag Kashyap. While the characteritsic repetitiveness of Trivedi was a problem here too, there was more than enough great music on offer.‘Halla’,written by Shellee, is my pick for the pulsating orchestration, Jyoti Nooran’s rendition and also for the moment in the movie when the song appears. ‘Dilbaro’ (Raazi) The most popular song fromRaaziand quite deservedly so; Shankar Ehsaa Loy and Gulzar build a beautifulbidaaisong around a traditional Kashmiri wedding piece. Harshdeep Kaur takes care of the rest, with brief but effective cameos from Vibha Saraf and Shankar Mahadevan. ‘Bol Ke Lab’ (Manto) The most exciting aspect about the Nandita Das film, at least to me, was the return of Sneha Khanwalkar, that too in style. In this song, Faiz’s powerful poetry gets a raag Yaman-flavoured melody from the composer. She has two classical exponents — Rashid Khan and Vidya Shah — singing it and adorns it with a rich backdrop of strings, harmonium and clarinets. ‘Aaj Se Teri’ (Pad Man) Among singers, Arijit Singh had the best year; as if in contradicting the (misplaced) criticism that he sings the same kind of songs. My favourite from the Arijit range is this beauty by Amit Trivedi and Kausar Munir, based on raag Bhimplaasi that the composer has employed well in the past too. ‘Naino Waale Ne’ (Padmaavat) One of the best things about Sanjay Leela Bhansali movies is the visual representation of songs. It was surprising therefore that the best song ofPadmaavatnever even made it to the screen. Neeti Mohan leads this lovely melody that takes on the occasional wistful tone with the raag Darbari Kanada flavoured cues on sitar. ‘Bohot Dukha Mann’ (Mukkabaaz) Composer Rachita Arora, who showed promise in her debut last year (Newton), continued to deliver it. In this melancholic classical-flavoured piece written by Hussain Haidry, she doubles up as a singer alongside Dev Arijit, and does a fabulous job at that. ‘Aahista’ (Laila Majnu) With this soundtrack co-composed with Joi Barua and Alif, sitar exponent Niladri Kumar had everyone wishing he would make more music in Hindi movies. In this song (written by Irshad Kamil, sung by Jonita Gandhi and Arijit Singh), Kumar literally takes you on a romantic journey across the Kashmir valley. ‘Dhadak’ (Dhadak) The problem with remakes is that you find yourself hard-pressed not to keep comparing them with the original work. Even taking that into account, the title song ofDhadak(remake of Nagraj Manjule’s Marathi hitSairat) holds up admirably. It is hard not to fall in love with Ajay Atul’s lush violins and haunting tune, delivered by Ajay Gogavle and Shreya Ghoshal. ‘Andhadhun’ (Andhadhun) While Amit Trivedi produced a competent set of songs for Sriram Raghavan inAndhadhun, my favourite still remains the guest composition by Raftaar and Girish Nakod. The piano and percussion-heavy (always a sucker for Marathi percussion!) title song perfectly captures the heady rush of the ride that the movie turns out to be. ‘Grey Walaa Shade’ (Manmarziyaan) A song that, in addition to introducing the lead pair’s romance on-screen, turns out to be emblematic of the movie itself. It is replete with Amit Trivedi’s trademark quirkiness, further accentuated by the dancing twins that appear in the song’s video. ‘Nagri Nagri’ (Manto) Shankar Mahadevan delivers this piece that, in keeping with the movie’s setting, carries a melody and a style of rendition that is evocative of the ‘40s. Composer Sneha Khanwalkar does, however, by her own admission, get cheeky with the arrangement with some electronic elements finding their way towards the end. That does not in any way take away from the song’s appeal. ‘Chaav Laga’ (Sui Dhaaga) The team that gave us ‘Moh Moh Ke Dhaage’ (Dum Lagaa Ke Haishaa) two years back reunited inSui Dhaagato deliver another simple yet beautiful piece, the wonderful Ronkini Gupta being the only addition on the vocal front this time. ‘Mere Naam Tu’ (Zero) While the reviews of the movie have been mixed, what everyone appears to agree on is how well this song has been depicted on screen. An incredible melody backed by Ajay Atul’s trademark sweeping orchestration and a fabulous Bollywood playback debut for Abhay Jodhpurkar. ‘Naina Banjaare’ (Pataakha) Vishal Bhardwaj-Gulzar soundtrack for the movie was an uncharacteristically short one and not as top notch as their previous albums. In this song the duo gets everything right, with ample help from Arijit of course. A gem that in its light-heartedness takes my mind back to‘Dil Toh Bachcha Hai Ji’fromIshqiya. ‘Mujhe Chaand Pe Le Chalo’ (Sanju) AR Rahman was more active in the South this year, his two songs for Sanju’s six-song soundtrack being the only Bollywood contributions. The shoddy visual treatment the song received might have something to do with it not becoming particularly popular, but there is no denying the brilliance of this dreamy, sensual piece written by Irshad Kamil sung with a fitting verve by Nikhita Gandhi. ‘Raazi’ (Raazi) Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy (SEL) have given us a lot of anthemic pieces over time; in Meghna Gulzar’sRaazi, the trio alongside Gulzar and Arijit Singh, channel their soundscape fromMirzyato produce this wonderfully earthy motivational piece. ‘Ishq Di Baajiyaan’(Soorma) Soorma’s music may not sit too well in the combined portfolio of Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy and Gulzar but is still quite an enjoyable one; this folksy piece (where Diljit Dosanjh gets behind the mic) mostly so. ‘Heartquake’ (Karwaan) Composer Anurag Saikia’s promising entry into mainstream Bollywood went largely under the radar, possibly because all the movies he has been involved in so far were multi-composer. Two of those came from director Akarsh Khurana, and it is in this light and quirky track written by Khurana himself, that Saikia delivers his best of the year.|0|
Potpourri at the cinemas|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST| The NTR biopic headlined by Balakrishna took an entirely different turn the moment director Krish Jagarlamudi stepped in. The director also wrapped upManikarnikaas soon as possible and gave this film all the attention he could. No one doubts Krish’s capabilities and the production house reportedly too took great care of the cast and crew. So happy was Vidya Balan that she distributed sweets to the entire team on the last day of shoot. She worked for 15 days. Bharath Reddy played Daggubati Venkateswara Rao, Daggubati Raja as NTR’s brother, Sumanth as Akkineni Nageswara Rao and Rana Daggubati as Chandrababu Naidu. Purandareswari’s character , is being essayed by a new artiste; other characters include those like T Anjaiah and Kotla Vijaybhaskar Reddy. The first partKathanayakuduis about NTR’s journey in cinema till he turns to politics and the second partMahanayakududeals with his political career. Brace up for the release of these two parts in January and February.  AfterSrimanthuduandBharat Ane Nenu, Mahesh Babu will be seen in this film directed by Vamsi Paidipally.Maharshiis said to deal with issues like organic farming and friendship. Sources state that one can expect a bond on the lines of Krishna-Kuchela, with Allari Naresh playing the part of man going through a bad patch and gets help from his childhood buddy. Mahesh, who plays a character that lives in the US, returns on learning that his friend whose survival depends on agriculture is facing a crisis. Pooja Hegde and Mahesh essay characters called Maha and Rishi.  Samantha had a great 2018 and is using that position to steer away from the routine. Expect to see her shine in director Shiva Nirvana’sMajiliinwhich she stars alongside Naga Chaitanya. Samantha is also shooting for director Nandini Reddy’sOh Baby, Yentha Sakkagunnavewhich is a remake of the Korean filmMiss Granny, a promising watch in summer 2019. Destiny plays a key element throughout the film that also showcases a unique tussle between mother and son. Samantha gets to play a 70-year-old woman who has an opportunity to turn into her 20-year-old self. Naga Shourya plays her love interest. Lakshmi Bhupal is the dialogue writer, and the film is being produced by Sunitha Thati and Suresh Productions.  This is an event-based biopic likeLincolnwhere the filmmaker choses a defining moment in a personality’s life and tries to capture the essence of his character. Political biopics are tricky — likePeriyar, IruvarandGandhi, so it will be interesting to see how the audience reconnects with YSR’s story inYatra. Eyeing the poll year for Andhra Pradesh, director Mahi Raghav’s film starring Mammootty as YSR aims high. Towards the end of 2019, the clash between the NTR and YSR biopics will be discussed. Mammooty returns to Telugu cinema after 25 years.  The revenue and expectations of Telugu films postBaahubalihave increased worldwide. Prabhas-starrerSaaho, directed by Sujeeth, is said to be a Hollywood-style project being made at more than Rs. 100 crore. Neil Nitin Mukesh, Vivek Oberoi and Shraddha Kapoor are part of the main cast and Sharad Kelkar who dubbed for Prabhas in the Hindi version ofBaahubaliwill do the honours forSaahoas well. As per the industry buzz,technically it is expected to raise the bar, and the stunt sequences will remind the audience ofFast And Furiousseries. Sources disclose that the two and a half hours film will have about 60 minutes of action sequences. Prabhas plays the most wanted thief while Shraddha Kapoor is the cop. We don’t know if there is a dual role but he definitely sports two looks. Sujeeth waited seven years to make this film; he and Prabhas share a common love for superhero stories, so this could be a binding factor of the actor and the director.  The sports drama starring Nani also looks at how personal relationships affect the game. Nani says it is one of the most honest scripts he came across and as soon as he heard the narration, he decided to take it up. Nani underwent training and put on some weight for the role. Incidentally, Nani had done another sports drama earlier. RememberBheemili Kabaddi Jattu?Jerseyis directed by Gautam Tinnanuri who made his debut withMalli Rava. Shraddha Srinath makes her debut in Telugu with this film.  Dr Rajashekar approached director Prasanth Varma even before the release of his debut filmAwe;he had a story that would be apt for him. The actor plays a character called Kalki in this investigative thriller, said to be a franchise, set in 1980s.Kalkiis expected to be a whodunit . Though the name has many layers and references to the mythological character, the film will not follow any template. Dr Rajashekar will be doing more action scenes than he did inGaruda Vega. A single shot action scene is being much talked about in industry circles. Adah Sharma and Nandita Shweta essay key characters.  History has it that Uyyalawada Narasimha Reddy was one of the first Indians to rebel against the British regime and demand freedom. The story of the Telugu freedom fighter from Rayalaseema who was hanged by the British is being brought to screen with Chiranjeevi essaying the titular role. The actor is in the right space to try such roles. After the success ofBaahubali, Chiranjeevi was confident that the risk of investing more than 100 crore on this historical subject would be worth it. It is alleged that the script was first offered by Paruchuri Brothers to Balakrishna postVamsodharakuduand director Jayant C Paranji was supposed to direct it at an estimated budget of Rs. 50 crore. Producer M S Reddy called it off, unconvinced by the financial prospects. Now years later,Sye Raahas been taken up by Konidela Productions and has a pan-Indian crew. Director Surender Reddy has a huge task at hand. Amitabh Bachchan had even posted a beautiful picture from the sets when he was in Hyderabad for the shoot.|0|

The conditions are perfect in the city this time of the year for paramotoring activities,” says Surya Teja, a pilot-instructor of Vihang Adventures. Every day, the team assesses the flying feasibility before starting the rides. This year, powered paragliding activities started on the second day of Visakha Utsav due to a delay in getting the required permissions. “The response in the past weekend had been very encouraging and made up for all the delay. We conducted more than 60 rides on a single day on December 31,” Surya says. S Ravikanth, who was one of the first to take up the sortie, says, “It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. The view from top was spectacular and since it glides softly in the air, you almost feel like you are flying!” The adventure sports firm has conducted over 30 paramotoring camps across Andhra Pradesh and Telangana in 2018, including Kakinada and Machilipatnam Beach Festivals and trying to set up a permanent base at RK Beach for paramotoring activities.  A bird’s eye-view The powered paragliders go up to a maximum height of 400 feet in a tandem ride. They have a capacity to fly up to a height of 10,000 feet. The ideal wind-speed should be between eight to 10 knots. Fly over the Kursura Submarine Museum and Hotel Novotel before returning to the starting point on the beach. Any one in the age group of 10 to 70 years can enjoy the ride. Venue:RK Beach (opp. food court)  Price:Rs. 1,500 (per ride)  Time:8 am to 8.30 pm|0|

Of music, lights and a celebration of life|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|A kaleidoscope of colours splashed across the RK Beach, turning it into a grand spectacle during the recently-concluded Visakha Utsav. An initiative of AP Tourism held in association with E Factor, the event saw some popular names from the music industry come down to the city to entertain the crowds. From Grammy award winner Ricky Kej and singer KK to bands like Thaikuddam Bridge and The Local Train— music ruled the festival. Thousands of people from Visakhapatnam and neighbouring districts as well as tourists from West Bengal, Chhattisgarh and Odisha came to the city to experience the festival. The three-day annual festival also showcased the folk and classical dances of Andhra Pradesh. The second day was marked by a classical dance performance by Kuchipudi Kala Kendra and a folklore by Jathara, which were the major crowd-pullers. But it was singer KK’s power-packed musical performance on the concluding day of the festival that won the hearts of the people. Notwithstanding the sudden dip in temperatures, families came to the breezy beachside venue well ahead of time to watch the live performances of their favourite artistes. “This year, Visakha Utsav was particularly entertaining and vibrant with the impressive line-up of artistes. Singer KK’s performance was the show-stopper of the event! He sang so many of my favourite songs in his melodious voice,” says Dr Sneha Maroo, who attended the festival with her husband. The flower show at Central Park was another big crowd-puller. With over two lakh flowers from 10,000 varieties, the flower show was a visual delight. “Most of the flowers were procured from Bengaluru, Kolkata and Kadiyam nurseries while the exotic ones were brought from Thailand,” says Sujay Dandapat, a flower dealer from Kolkata. A tethered hot air balloon at RK Beach was another major attraction. The lit-up balloon was placed as a promotion for the upcoming Araku Hot Air Balloon festival to be held from January 18 to 20.|0|
Street protests mark Kerala hartal|Thiruvananthapuram|January 04, 2019 00:00 IST|Hurling crude bombs and stones, Hindutva groups on Thursday fought pitched battles with police and political rivals in Kerala, leaving scores of people injured including three BJP workers in a knife attack, officials said. The dawn-to-dusk hartal called by the Sabarimala Karma Samithi, an umbrella organisation of pro-Hindutva groups, and the Antarrashtriya Hindu Parishad (AHP), to protest the entry of two women of reproductive age into the Sabarimala temple on Wednesday crippled the State. Right-wing activists were on the streets soon after the shutdown began, placing burning tyres and granite blocks on the roads, bringing vehicular traffic to a halt at several places. They attacked over 20 offices of the ruling CPI(M) and its other Left allies, and clashed with police, leaving at least 31 personnel injured. Tension was palpable in most parts of the State as busy streets wore a deserted look with people keeping indoors. Shops remained closed and public transport vehicles remained off the road. The strike left long-distance commuters from other States stranded at bus stations and railway terminals. The Kerala State Road Transport Corporation, which suffered sizeable losses with an estimated 99 buses damaged across the State, had drastically scaled down operations. The police operated skeletal services to transport patients and their attendants to hospitals. Bear the brunt The police said Palakkad, Kozhikode, Thiruvananthapuram and Thrissur bore the brunt of the violence. Police lobbed tear gas shells and resorted to lathicharge to disperse BJP and CPI(M) workers who fought each other with sticks and stones on the streets in Palakkad. Belligerent workers vandalised each other’s party offices and damaged parked vehicles. In Thrissur alleged Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) workers stabbed three BJP activists who attempted to close a hotel run by a minority community member. Hartal supporters in Kozhikode stormed the historic Mittai Theruvu, or Sweet Meat Street, and attacked traders who had opened shops ignoring their diktat. Protesters went on the rampage, smashing shop windows, throwing wares out onto the street and wrecking private vehicles parked on the road. (With PTI inputs)|0|
The lure of luxe|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Indians are travelling abroad like never before. According to the UN World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO), India will account for a record 50 million outbound tourists in 2020, a 100% jump from the current 25 million. Indians are also not shying away from spending on and demanding better services in the skies. They are looking for a lot more than a complimentary soup and a few breadsticks on board. What, you may ask? How about a zero-gravity seat in which you can rest your weary self through a long-haul flight? Some even offer mood-lighting, therapy sessions, and believe it or not, private suites! Leading the charge on this crusade to ‘better flying’ are airline companies from Asia and West Asia. Here are some of the most exclusive experiences that are up for offer 35,000 feet above the ground. The goodness of technology For a couple of decades now, Emirates has been convincing us persistently about their prowess as an innovative and luxurious carrier. Their new Boeing 777 liners set the bar pretty high for others. In fact, these flights are designed to make even economy travel a lot more comfortable than one would expect. The First and Business class suites are another deal altogether. Here, patrons have the advantage of walking into their very own private rooms. The novelty in each of these rooms is the inclusion of zero-gravity seats that are specially designed to emulate a feeling of weightlessness. Straight out of NASA, you may imagine. And rightly so. The soft, leathered seats and well-thought-through upholstery match the creature comforts offered by luxury hotels. Middle seats have the advantage of virtual windows that stream a live feed on a make-believe window, so you’re not missing out on anything. How cool is that? You’re also pampered with ambient mood lighting, temperature controls, a 32-inch HD LCD television, Safari binoculars, and an entertainment system with thousands of options. All in all, Emirates and Mercedes have endeavoured to offer the S-Class luxury up in the air. The elements inspired by Mercedes S-Class include the choice of material used, the quality of workmanship and the lighting system, within the First and Business class suites. Essa Sulaiman Ahmad, vice-president, India-Nepal, Emirates, describes it as thoughtful luxury. “This is the first time an Emirates product has been so influenced by another luxury brand, but it is a natural fit as both Emirates and Mercedes-Benz have the same unwavering commitment to fine detail, uncompromising quality, and a drive to push boundaries.” A therapeutic flight Cathay Pacific has got its luxury and passenger care right. Meditation comes to you, on a display screen during a long-haul flight. Cathay Pacific’s ‘Travel Well With Yoga’ ensures that passengers try yoga. The programme offers videos that can be played during flights. These are sprinkled with generous expert advice. The instructions are available in English, Cantonese, Mandarin, and Japanese. The entire programme is split into six easy-to-follow videos, in which Pure Yoga’s founding teacher Patrick Creelman and senior instructor and co-founder Almen Wong demonstrate routines designed to improve circulation, enhance joint mobility and relax the mind. Simon Cuthbert, who manages platforms and connectivity for the airliner, says, “We all know that sitting still for a long period of time can be uncomfortable. The need to get up, move and get your blood pumping is important during a flight. Yoga is an innovative way to do this. There are a series of exercises that can easily be done from an economy class seat, whilst other moves are suitable for after the flight in your hotel,” he says. Cabins for the dreamer First Class travel in Qatar Airways’ Qsuite offers customisable seating areas. Passengers can now use separator panels to adjust the way their partitions and seats are arranged. For instance, by moving partitions around, you could have a bedroom in the sky or a mini conference room if you want one. In addition to seating, even the screens are adjustable. It’s no surprise that the Qsuite was awarded the ‘Best Cabin Concept’, winning the coveted Crystal Cabin Award, a one-of-its-kind international award for excellence in aircraft interior innovation. “We are thrilled to be offering our loyal customers this unique product, which is unlike anything they have experienced before. The features that Qsuite offers provide the ultimate customisable travel experience that enables passengers to create an environment that suits their own needs,” said Qatar Airways Group chief executive, Akbar Al Baker. Rich in health While comfort, technological marvels, and unbelievable customisations are impressive, there’s nothing that comes close to gastronomic pleasures, and Etihad Airways has chosen this as the quickest way to its customers’ hearts. Their newly-introduced Weqaya menu, which quite literally translates to ‘prevention of illnesses’, is now available in business and first-class long-haul and ultra-long-haul outbound flights from Abu Dhabi and luxury lounges. The department of health was instrumental in putting this nutritious and one-of-its-kind menu together. Neerja Bhatia, vice-president–Indian Subcontinent, Etihad Airways, says, “With the addition of the Weqaya menu, we are extending our support to the department of health-Abu Dhabi, and offering an enhanced in-flight dining experience to guests, with more choices on-board.” Alaska Airlines offers its patrons virtual reality headsets and noise-cancelling headphones — because LED screens are so yesterday.

Cooking off the clock|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Some years ago, I became the unlikely custodian of my family’s heirloom recipes. My grandmother had documented and filed them in many cardboard boxes, and wanted to make a book out of them. When she passed away suddenly, I picked up the baton. I found myself spending endless hours in the local markets, looking for fresh, organic, seasonal produce and whole unpolished grains. In the kitchen, I was roasting whole spices, grinding masalas, grating coconut, churning butter, making ghee, pickling mangoes and fermentingdosabatter. Although it seemed like a rite of passage to me, in reality, I was locating myself in an age-old gastronomic culture, which is often referred to as ‘slow food’. What started as a movement in Italy in the ’80s, as a response to the fast food invasion and as an effort to preserve local food traditions, has expanded to all parts of the globe, broadening in scope. I spoke to some inspiring people who imbibe this philosophy in word and spirit to further understand what it means to indeed “slow down” with food. Archana Pidathala is the author of the cookbook,Five Morsels of Love    Padmanabhan, a farmer herself, founded this organic farming collective to propagate sustainable practices that would benefit farmers, consumers and the environment. “The idea of slow needs to be thought about from the very beginning in the life cycle of food, from the seeds that we sow to grow our food,” she says. “For instance, heirloom varieties of millets, which typically have a growing cycle of five months, are being rapidly replaced by hybrid versions that grow in three months.” In 2018, Padmanabhan and her team intensified the search for indigenous seeds, with the intent of sowing and growing crops in their natural seasons. “We planted a patch of watermelons which will only fruit in the summer, and not through the year,” she shares. Next year, the collective will open an organic cafe, which will be run using slow food principles and produce from the farm. On Facebook at Buffalo Back Collective      “As a food culture, we have always espoused ‘slow’, making things from scratch, eating clean and fresh, not damaging the environment we grow our food in, preserving excess produce, and being mindful about waste,” shares Philip, who runs The Farm, a restaurant, shop and dairy. “Slow is not a label or fad in our part of the world. It’s our way of life.” From foraging and eating wild greens which most of us would dismiss as weeds, to making their own cleaning solution from soap nuts and ash, to slow cooking their famed Coorgpandicurry overnight using just the residual heat of their pizza oven, everything in The Farm is about sustainable existence. To keep indigenous food traditions and culture alive in its own way, The Farm introduced staff specials on the menu — dishes from the homes of the employees, like the now popular Naga style pork and bamboo curry, made with fermented bamboo and fieryraja mirchasourced from Nagaland. 2018 saw experiments with slow drinks (including infusion teas brewed using wild flowers from the garden). Next year, diners can expect to see more wild, edible greens on the menu.  On Instagram @thefarmchennai     “Indigenous people are the true custodians of everything slow,” says Kairaly, who grew up in Anantapur, where her parents started Timbaktu Collective, an organisation dedicated to sustainable development in the drought-prone region. She worked for Slow Food when the movement entered India, and Timbaktu Collective continues to be a member. Kairaly explains how hand-tilling the land, moving away from mono cropping, stone-milling the grains, cold processing oils, cooking in earthen pots and eating community meals are all essential cogs in the slow food wheel. As an expansion of the community kitchen that the collective has been running for the past 28 years, plans are underway to establish a rural, youth-oriented slow food community in 2019. On Facebook at Timbaktu Collective     She left a career in wealth management in New York, and now lives entirely off her farm near Mysuru, which she runs with Kabir Cariappa (pictured). Whatever she cannot grow herself, she barters with fellow farmers. “Eating food in its fullest form — raw when possible, including ancient grains (millets) and unpolished whole lentils — are ways to adopt slow food as a way of living,” she observes. When a friend asked for advice on dealing with a pest attack on her patch of gourds, Rudraraju advised her to “look at the whole picture” — assess where the seeds came from, if they were suitable to be grown in the altitude and soil they were planted in, whether they were sown in the right season, what other crops were planted along with the gourds, and so on. This year, Rudraraju and team made up to 40 varieties of indigenous heirloom seeds available on their website, yarrowfarm.com.

Mirroring us|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|All that time spent scrolling through social media posts is taking a toll. For some travellers, vacations don’t matter unless they are in picture-perfect spots that can be shared on social media platforms. Some mimic poses of their favourite celebrities, while a few others scout for similar accommodation. Results of a recent survey show the extent of social media stimulus on vacation and behaviour patterns of Indian travellers. Around 66% of Indian travellers surveyed by Booking.com stated that they see travel as a potential opportunity to earn a living as an influencer or travel blogger. The web portal’s travel predictions for 2019 reveals that social media will continue to impact the way we travel. Insights were gathered from over 163 million verified guest reviews, along with its research encompassing 21,500 travellers across 29 countries (1,000 from India). The results found seven in 10 Indian travellers to be excited about the prospect of space travel in 2019 and beyond, and are open to considering the experience themselves, while three in five travellers say they would rather stay in accommodation under the sea than in space. Further, the survey revealed that 53% of Indian travellers look at where celebrities stay and try to find accommodation that looks similar. In fact, 24% of Indian travellers try to re-create poses from one of their favourite celebs or Instagrammers. Giving in to the pressure of social media gratification, 30% respondents admitted to having posted an older, more flattering image from a previous holiday rather than from their current trip. And 42% have taken a picture of a different accommodation pretending they are staying there. About 63% want to stay in accommodation that will look good on social media, and 22% have pretended to still be on vacation when they are actually at home.|0|
Music and the lyricist|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|The year ended with the sad news of American lyricist Norman Gimbel passing away at the age of 91. He was best known for writing the English version of the Portuguese bossa nova hit ‘The Girl from Ipanema’, and Roberta Flack’s iconic ‘Killing Me Softly With His Song’, he was also associated with singers Andy Williams, Jim Croce, Dean Martin, Olivia Newton John and Barry Manilow, besides many television shows. Obituaries were carried in mainline newspapers and music websites. Yet, one couldn’t escape the fact that many music lovers had been totally unaware of his contribution. After all, Gimbel belonged to that small community of standalone lyricists, who penned memorable songs but never got the recognition they deserved. Penned for posterity In popular international music, many songs are written, composed and performed by the same person. Most Beatles songs were created by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, with George Harrison chipping in at times. The Rolling Stones hits were mainly created by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, whereas the ABBA beauties were the brainchild of Benny Anderson and Bjorn Ulvaeus. In many groups, the members contributed equally. Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen and Van Morrison wrote their own songs. There are thousands of examples. There are exceptions, of course, of cover versions where musicians render songs written by others. Eric Clapton, for instance, had huge hits for the works of J.J. Cale, Bob Marley and Bob Dylan. Even Elvis Presley did a version of Creedence Clearwater Revival’s ‘Proud Mary’. Many blues singers have reworked pieces by Willie Dixon. The difference, however, was that these songs had already been performed by the original creators. The other kind of exception comprised the singer-writer team. Paul Simon wrote extensively for Simon & Garfunkel. Elton John’s songs were written by Bernie Taupin, and Robert Hunter often wrote for the Grateful Dead. Andrew Lloyd Webber’s stage musicals were adorned by the words of Tim Rice.  Behind the scenes Gimbel, like his peers, wrote songs specifically for musicians, without getting into the composition and performance aspects. Yet, he remained lesser-known. Many would actually be surprised to discover his role in ‘Killing Me Softly’, a major radio hit of its time. Let’s mention a few other members of this standalone lyricist community. The trendsetter was W.S. Gilbert of Gilbert & Sullivan, who wrote many comic operas in the late 19th century. Much later, Hal David was behind ‘Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head’, ‘I Say A Little Prayer’ and ‘Alfie’. Ira Gershwin wrote many songs for his brother, composer George Gershwin – except the latter’s most famous hit ‘Summertime’, penned by DuBose Heyward. Oscar Hammerstein II is idolised for ‘The Sound of Music’. Lorenz Hart, who wrote many Broadway classics, is best-known for ‘The Lady is a Tramp’ and ‘My Funny Valentine’. Other popular names were Carl Sigman, Dorothy Fields, Yip Harburg, Gus Kahn, Arthur Freed and Alan Jay Lerner. Among the late 20th century lyricists, there was Diane Warren, who wrote for Whitney Houston, Tina Turner, Barbra Streisand, Aretha Franklin, Enrique Iglesias and Toni Braxton. The international music system remains different from Hindi film music, where the lyricist has his own role (and yet gets overshadowed). The Western wordsmiths may be fewer in number but have played a phenomenal role, considering their songs are sung even today.|0|
A Year in Children’s Books|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|As a picture book editor, I spend my working days surrounded by words ranging from zero to 1,200 and a cluster of images that bring them to life. Then I come back home to more books, some for research, and others as the one thing I love to do most – read. In 2018, I found myself struggling with long form. When you edit picture books, you’re constantly ‘Editor Scissorhands’ (no, you cannot steal that phrase), snipping off extraneous words until you have a core of an emotion. Something that Oliver Jeffers told me in an interview last year and it really stuck with me. His bookHere We Are: Notes for Living on Planet Earth(HarperCollins) is a great example of using few words to tell a story of this spectacular planet we inhabit. Words of the wise So, I pushed myself to go back to long form, banning myself from picture book leisurely reading for a month. Also, concerned about the packaging that comes with online buying, I resolved to buy children’s books only from indie bookstores. This meant I waited for ages for Neil Gaiman and Chris Riddell’sArt Matters(Headline Review).But it was worth it as my Lightroom bookstore friend gifted me this gorgeous book about art and ideas. It was the same for Robert MacFarlane and Jackie Morris’sThe Lost Words(Penguin),a spell book about nature words. When it wasn’t available in India, my friend sent me a copy all the way from the U.K. I recently read the book aloud with Sangeeta Bhansali, the owner of Kahani Tree bookstore in Mumbai and remembered again, why it’s so special. To interview Anthony Horowitz, I plunged into his Alex Rider series (Hachette), and found myself surprisingly hooked. I don’t like action books usually, although I enjoy his crime novels for adults, it was my nephew who nudged me to read the series years after I reviewed the first book. I see why the British author has been called “the not-so-secret weapon to get boys reading”. I was haunted for days by Angie Thomas’sThe Hate U Give(Penguin).Here’s to more powerful voices like Starr Carter in our troubled times. Just like Korok inYear of the Weeds(Duckbill)by Siddhartha Sarma – a powerful YA novel which is a fictional retelling of the Niyamgiri movement in Odisha. Loud and clear I found myself looking for more #ownvoices stories – I read Hansda Sowvendra Shekhar’sJwala Kumar and the Gift of Fire(Talking Cub),an adorable novella about a baby dragon in Champakbag; as well asOne Crazy Summerby Rita Williams-Garcia. I was pleased as a conservationist who spots a Great Indian Bustard, when we printed one of our attempts at the same –The Very Wiggly Tooth(Pratham Books) by Reshma Thapa Gurung and Canato Jimo, a contemporary tale set in Sikkim. It’s a relief to see narratives moving away from the urban also. I also read Devashish Makhija and Priya Kuriyan’sWhen Ali Became Bajrangbali(Tulika),a seven-year-old picture book that I had somehow never got my hands on. When I heard Priya talking about it, I finally got around to read it. A monkey swings into action when his home is threatened, but it’s actually a subversive book about religion and power dynamics. Future is female This was truly the year to read girl positive books – Aparna Jain’sLike a Girl(Context), Rad Women Worldwide: Artists and Athletes, Pirates and Punks, and Other Revolutionaries Who Shaped History(Ten Speed Press) byKate SchatzandMiriam Klein Stahl,Katha’s gender series,I Need to Pee(Penguin) by Neha Singh, Meenal Singh and Erik Egerup, Anna's Extraordinary Experiments with Weather(Pratham Books) by Nandita Jayaraj and Priya Kuriyan, Anita Vachharajani and Kalyani Ganapathy’sAmrita Sher-Gil: Rebel with a Paintbrush(HarperCollins).My friend Shinibali’s daughter adoredBrazen: Rebel Ladies Who Rocked the World Paperback(First Second) by Pénélope Bagieu. After all, who can resist a girl who draws trolls or one who has a beard? But,Nimonaby Noelle Stevenson, a graphic novel recommended by Aparna, has my heart. Oh, talking of fantasy, do readThe Magicians of Madh(Duckbill) by Aditi Krishnakumar as well as Shazaf Fatima Haider’sA Firefly in the Dark(Talking Cub). I found them utterly charming. This year, I had the privilege of visiting Kashmir twice – once on holiday with friends and the other with Bookaroo Festival of Children’s Literature. In the evening, as authors and illustrators huddled around the heater, we all felt a deep admiration for the students of DPS Srinagar. Their searing poetry and art reflects how curfew andhartalimpacts their day-to-day school life – they want to sit in classes, and hang out with friends, a normalcy not often granted to them. Which is why perhaps I felt more convinced about our book,Mission Cycle(Pratham Books) by Rohini Mohan and Jayesh Sivan. It’s the story of a girl who is home because of C.U.R.F.E.W and how she copes with it. Talking of war, I also read the stellarWhen Morning Comes(Duckbill) by Ayushi Raina,Red(Tulika) by Sagar Kolwankar, and Khaled Hosseini and Dan William’s stunningSea Prayer(Bloomsbury). Words and pictures Earlier this year, a friend and I sat in Trilogy by the Eternal Library, when it’s co-owner Ahalya popped in with Aina Bestard’sWhat’s Hidden in the Sea(Thames and Hudson).We sat for the next several minutes (or was it hours?), using the three-coloured glasses to look at the sea in its pages. Each turn elicited a squeal and a smile, as we found hidden underwater scenes come to life, revealing all sorts of marvelous marine life. We left clutching a copy each. When Ankit Chadha left us too soon, I reread his book,Amir Khusrau: The Man in Riddles(Penguin). When I was sent aNew Yorkerpiece, I discoveredFrom the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E Frankweilerby E. L. Konigsburg. Truly timelines, in this 1967 book, Claudia decides to run away to the MET. I don’t think I have highlighted as many phrases in a book as inHello, Universe(Green Willow) by Erin Entrada Kelly – it’s such fabulous writing. Like take this one – “People don't want to listen to their thoughts, so they fill the world with noise.” That said, I may have done the same thing withFly by Nightby Francis Hardinge – yes, I finally read it, and am enchanted. The book series that made me the happiest wasNevermoor(Hachette). Written by Jessica Townsend, the series is funny and wildly imaginative and fills a Potter-shaped hole for me. Alas, now like those wizardly books, I have to wait for the next in the series. I got a staggering pile of books from a friend and fell in love with Cori Doerrfeld’sThe Rabbit Listened,about loss and empathy; andTown is by the Seaby Joanne Schwartz and Sydney Smith. I got teary-eyed reading the latter – words and pictures illuminate a child’s beautiful surroundings and the claustrophobia of his father’s work as a miner, shedding light on the things we ignore when it comes to opportunities and work. I ended 2018 with two books: My first Liz Climo book,Lobster is the Best Medicine. And secondly, andStrange Worlds! Strange Times! Amazing Sci-Fi Stories(Talking Cub). The latter is edited by Vinayak Varma and has some of the coolest names in sci-fi writing and it’s for young adults! 2019 better live up to last year’s reads. I do read books for adults, a lot of them, in case you were wondering. More recommendations on Instagram at bam_books.

My bags are packed, I’m ready to go|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST| Zadar has often been outshone by its popular siblings — the charming city of Dubrovnik and party animals Split and Hvar. But those who have visited the port city of Zadar, will vouch that this is where you get gorgeous sunsets. Alfred Hitchcock was amazed by them. At the promenade, hear the lilting tunes from the Sea Organ. Steps lead into the water and those underwater have pipes that create music when waves snuggle up to them. These tunes and the cool breeze make you feel warm, fuzzy and melancholic, all at once. Then there is the installation by architect Nikola Bašić, called Greeting to the Sun. This 22-metre circular disc works on solar energy and emits dazzling lights in the evening. Some use it as a dance floor, others just laze on it, do yoga there or even use it as a romantic prop for proposals. Zadar also hosts music festivals and is a great base from where you can set off to explore national parks and islands. It is teeming with historical monuments such as Fosa, Rector’s Palace, Five Wells, Forum, etc. And you can let you hair down at Varos, a hip neighbourhood brimming with quirky bars. Don’t forget to try their maraschino, local cherry liqueur along with fresh catch from the sea.  Flamingo kitsch has been ruling the fashion world for almost two years now. If these winged wonders look so cool on clothes and accessories, imagine how awesome they’ll look in your holiday pictures. “Flamingos have become insanely popular in the last few years here in Aruba,” says Marcella Janczewski from the Visit Aruba team. They roost on Renaissance Island that has a huge fan following worldwide, thanks to selfies with the pretty pink birds that abound on social media. It is a private island and one needs to buy a day pass in advance. Recently, flamingos have also been introduced to De Palm Island. A day ticket is required here as well. This Dutch island in the Caribbean Sea is also known for its crystal-clear waters, where you can snorkel, sail, scuba dive, kite surf and be a beach bum. It’s sunny, windy and always warm here. “Don’t forget your sunscreen as we are close to the Equator and the sun is strong,” advises Marcella. In addition, she recommends visiting Arikok National Park, the Natural Pool, Bushiribana Gold Mill Ruins, Alto Vista Chapel... “There is a party any day or night of the week here. Wednesday to Sunday are the most popular nights for going out. Clubs, bars and lounges are all closely located (you can find many in the Palm Beach area) so it is easy to hop around. Some hotspots include Gusto Night Club, MooMba Beach Bar and Sand Bar,” says Marcella. Oranjestad is the capital of Aruba and the island nation is small enough to be covered in a day.  The colourful wooden houses of Kalamaja look as if they have stepped out of Noddy land. An area populated by fishermen since the 14th Century, this is now one of the coolest neighbourhoods in Tallinn. While the Old Town is always the most visited, areas such as Kalamaja and Rotermann, with avant garde architecture, are where the trendy, creative set can be spotted. The Telliskivi Creative City — located in a reclaimed factory area — with its eatery, boutiques, an antique book store, theatre and weekly dance nights and flea markets, is sought after. In addition, the city also has a growing number of spas. “Many cruise ships dock in Tallinn. In fact, that’s what brought in tourists around a decade ago,” says Thea Sepp, Information Specialist at the Tallinn Tourist Information Centre. “This year, we have received more than 300 cruise ships with about 6,00,000 tourists,” she adds. The Kohtuotsa viewing platform, Town Hall Square, St Olav’s church, St Catherine’s Passage, Seaplane Harbour and Town Wall find themselves on most sightseeing lists. The Song Festival Grounds is another favourite and the venue for the Estonian Song and Dance Festival that happens once in every five years. Luckily, it will take place this year in July and will feature thousands of dancers and choir performers.  This is one city where you may not feel broke. Don’t forget to get a relaxing massage or a hair spa treatment or even fake eyelashes here. It costs way less than India and the quality is commendable too. Hanoi sits by the Red River, embracing its age-old colonial monuments, temples, museum and mausoleum. It is also proud of its modern Lotte Tower, glitzy hotels and Nhat Tan Bridge. In the heart of the bustling city lies the tranquil Hoan Kiem Lake, one of the most photographed spots in the city. This is also where the Old Quarter is; a commercial area bustling with shops and nightlife. There are specific streets that sell kitchen ware, herbs, cotton, and so on. The tailors in Vietnam are known for their craft. Get a few outfits tailored while there, especially the Ao Dai, the local dress. Try the egg coffee, or the traditional coffee that comes with a generous serving of condensed milk. The variety of street food is mind-boggling. Frombanh mitobun cha, it’ll make sure you never go hungry. You can discover Hanoi by foot, or choose from limos, regular cabs, three-wheeled cycle rickshaws or even motorcycle taxis.  Everything in the Plaza de Espana in Seville has the power to make even the most mediocre photograph look exceptional. There is something magical about the architecture of this city, from the Gothic cathedral, the Giralda, the Alcazar with its Mudejar work, to the narrow lanes that cradle old-world bars and restaurants. It’s where ‘Despacito’ and ‘Chantaje’ are punctuated by the gallop of horses pulling carriages that look straight out of a fairy tale. The recent hot spot is the Metropol Parasol, a 26-metre-high wooden structure that resembles a giant waffle or a mushroom. Flamenco bars thrive in the neighbourhood of Triana that’s across the Guadalquivir river. The bars have more locals than tourists, and matching steps with them is nearly impossible. The dancing starts late by 10 pm and doesn’t stop till the wee hours of the morning. Local singers put up impromptu performances as people show off their Flamenco steps. This is way more fun than just sitting through a serious Flamenco performance.|0|

More of less|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|A month ago, when ophthalmic surgeon Shibal Bhartiya had to travel to Geneva and wanted an umbrella to carry along, her friend Mohana Talapatra stepped in with a design-rich umbrella bought on the streets of Madrid. A week later, the orange umbrella was back on Talapatra’s shelf. Bhartiya and Talapatra have aspired to live a sustainable life for many years now. On December 4, they threw open a private initiative to a larger group of people with a closed Facebook group called The Minimalists of Delhi. Entry is by invite only, after people answer a few questions on their ethos, living methods and philosophy. The simple idea is based on the sharing economy, where people lend things to those who need it for a short time. In case of garments, they have to be returned after being cleaned. Some insist on paying in kind; through cupcakes, for instance. The forum has about 210 members, and requests range from a pinkpotlibag to an electric blanket. Among the things being offered for sharing are silver jewellery, handmade yellow leather boots, a warm coat and tailored business jackets ideal for those attending interviews for winter internships. Among the first things shared in the group was a Buddha head speckled in gold; it will shortly move to an institute in the Himalayas. Talapatra, a finance and analytics consultant, has moved continents, from the UK to USA to China, more than once, before finally putting down roots in the capital. All the while, she accumulated some artefacts and gave many away. “For instance, Shanghai is an expat city, where you can move into a fully furnished home. When I moved, I gave away most of what I owned and came back with just suitcases.” One of her most favourite possessions, a Chinese antique chest of drawers, has a new home in Bengaluru. “It’s strange, but even after I moved back to India, I never felt like owning it again. While it was with me, it gave me joy, and it continues to spread joy to someone else. It’s liberating to not be tied down to something,” she says.  Bhartiya, who wore a friend’s silk sari for her brother’s wedding, also hopes that besides allowing for objects sourced with passion to find temporary new homes and owners, this circle of sharing will help develop a sense of community that will serve people in these divisive times. Meanwhile, the friends are putting together a trunk show of sorts featuring saris, jewellery and other bric-a-brac. They are confident people will warm up to this concept once they get over the mindset that anything pre-owned is ‘old’ “It’s silly to buy an intricate handloom sari spending thousands and lock it up in a cupboard. And there’s so much variety to choose from. To give and receive. This is the circle of life we should aspire to be part of,” says Bhartiya.|0|
Dissent note on Citizenship Bill|New Delhi|January 04, 2019 00:00 IST|Members of four Opposition parties — the Congress, the Trinamool Congress, the Samajwadi Party and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) — have moved a dissent note against the report of the joint committee on Citizenship Amendment Bill 2016. The Bill proposes to give citizenship to six persecuted minorities — Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, Parsis, Christians and Buddhists — from Pakistan. The Opposition members have been demanding that the Bill should be made “religion and country neutral.”|0|
Trump’s remarks rejected by India|NEW DELHI|January 04, 2019 00:00 IST|India on Thursday reiterated that it does not send soldiers abroad but for UN-supported peacekeeping operations. The statement from sources came hours after U.S. President Donald Trump during an interaction spoke mockingly about India’s development projects in Afghanistan, while suggesting that Delhi should send troops to control the decades-long conflict in the country. Specific mandate “India firmly believes in the critical role that developmental assistance can play in transforming human lives. India does not send its armed forces abroad except under the specific mandate of UN Peacekeeping Operations,” said a source speaking on condition of anonymity. Mr. Trump had referred to his conversation with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging that Indian contribution to Kabul be increased and diversified as humanitarian contribution was not enough. “I could give you an example where I get along very well with India and Prime Minister Modi. But he is constantly telling me, he built a library in Afghanistan. Library! That's like five hours of what we spend (in Afghanistan),” Mr. Trump told his colleagues and the media in Washington DC. He urged Russia, India and Pakistan to send troops to fight the Taliban.|0|
The lure of luxe|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|Indians are travelling abroad like never before. According to the UN World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO), India will account for a record 50 million outbound tourists in 2020, a 100% jump from the current 25 million. Indians are also not shying away from spending on and demanding better services in the skies. They are looking for a lot more than a complimentary soup and a few breadsticks on board. What, you may ask? How about a zero-gravity seat in which you can rest your weary self through a long-haul flight? Some even offer mood-lighting, therapy sessions, and believe it or not, private suites! Leading the charge on this crusade to ‘better flying’ are airline companies from Asia and West Asia. Here are some of the most exclusive experiences that are up for offer 35,000 feet above the ground. For a couple of decades now, Emirates has been convincing us persistently about their prowess as an innovative and luxurious carrier. Their new Boeing 777 liners set the bar pretty high for others. In fact, these flights are designed to make even economy travel a lot more comfortable than one would expect. The First and Business class suites are another deal altogether. Here, patrons have the advantage of walking into their very own private rooms. The soft, leathered seats and well-thought-through upholstery match the creature comforts offered by luxury hotels. Middle seats have the advantage of virtual windows that stream a live feed on a make-believe window, so you’re not missing out on anything. How cool is that? You’re also pampered with ambient mood lighting, temperature controls, a 32-inch HD LCD television, Safari binoculars, and an entertainment system with thousands of options. All in all, Emirates and Mercedes have endeavoured to offer the S-Class luxury up in the air. The elements inspired by Mercedes S-Class include the choice of material used, the quality of workmanship and the lighting system, within the First and Business class suites. Essa Sulaiman Ahmad, vice-president, India-Nepal, Emirates, describes it as thoughtful luxury. “This is the first time an Emirates product has been so influenced by another luxury brand, but it is a natural fit as both Emirates and Mercedes-Benz have the same unwavering commitment to fine detail, uncompromising quality, and a drive to push boundaries.” A therapeutic flight Cathay Pacific has got its luxury and passenger care right. The airline often expresses the special efforts it takes to tend to the wellbeing of its passengers.Meditation comes to you, on a display screen during a long-haul flight. Cathay Pacific’s ‘Travel Well With Yoga’ ensures that passengers try yoga. The programme offers videos that can be played during flights. These are sprinkled with generous expert advice. The instructions are available in English, Cantonese, Mandarin, and Japanese. The entire programme is split into six easy-to-follow videos, in which Pure Yoga’s founding teacher Patrick Creelman and senior instructor and co-founder Almen Wong demonstrate routines designed to improve circulation, enhance joint mobility and relax the mind. Simon Cuthbert, who manages platforms and connectivity for the airliner, says, “We all know that sitting still for a long period of time can be uncomfortable. The need to get up, move and get your blood pumping is important during a flight. Yoga is an innovative way to do this. There are a series of exercises that can easily be done from an economy class seat, whilst other moves are suitable for after the flight in your hotel,” he says. Cabins for the dreamer First Class travel in Qatar Airways’ Qsuite offers customisable seating areas. Passengers can now use separator panels to adjust the way their partitions and seats are arranged. For instance, by moving partitions around, you could have a bedroom in the sky or a mini conference room if you want one. “We are thrilled to be offering our loyal customers this unique product, which is unlike anything they have experienced before. The features that Qsuite offers provide the ultimate customisable travel experience that enables passengers to create an environment that suits their own needs,” said Qatar Airways Group chief executive, Akbar Al Baker. Rich in health  While comfort, technological marvels, and unbelievable customisations are impressive, there’s nothing that comes close to gastronomic pleasures, and Etihad Airways has chosen this as the quickest way to its customers’ hearts. Their newly-introduced Weqaya menu, which quite literally translates to ‘prevention of illnesses’, is now available in business and first-class long-haul and ultra-long-haul outbound flights from Abu Dhabi and luxury lounges. The department of health was instrumental in putting this nutritious and one-of-its-kind menu together. Neerja Bhatia, vice-president–Indian Subcontinent, Etihad Airways, says, “With the addition of the Weqaya menu, we are extending our support to the department of health-Abu Dhabi, and offering an enhanced in-flight dining experience to guests, with more choices on-board.” Alaska Airlines offers its patrons virtual reality headsets and noise-cancelling headphones — because LED screens are so yesterday.

Every second means life and death for miners, says SC|NEW DELHI|January 04, 2019 00:00 IST|“Every second means life and death for those 15 trapped miners,” Justice A. K. Sikri said, even as the Supreme Court expressed its dissatisfaction with the ongoing operations to rescue men from the flooded rat-hole mine in Meghalaya. A Bench of Justices A.K. Sikri and S. Abdul Nazeer said the rescue efforts seemed uncoordinated and yielding no results. The court asked the Centre what it had done so far. “You had wanted to send high-powered pumps to Thailand [to rescue Thai boys and their teacher trapped in a cave]... Why have you not done it here? Why?” Justice Sikri asked Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta, for the Centre. “We are not satisfied. There should be one central coordinated rescue effort and it is the Union of India which should do something,” Justice Sikri observed. Army’s offer Mr. Mehta responded that the Coal Minister, along with the Meghalaya Chief Minister and senior officials, was monitoring the rescue, and would appoint a nodal officer for the effort. The court asked why the government had previously refused the Army’s offer of help. “Army offered to help, but the government did not want it. Why?” Justice Sikri asked Mr. Mehta. “Instead of the Army, we have the NDRF [the National Disaster Response Force],” Mr. Mehta responded. “But there are already 72 NDRF personnel there, with no result,” Justice Sikri persisted. “Instead of the Army, we decided to send the Navy... Navy divers...,” Mr. Mehta continued. To which Justice Sikri told Mr. Mehta, “This is a question of life and death for the miners... Something has to be done immediately.” The court asked Mr. Mehta to get instructions and return the next day.|0|
Sales and the self help groups|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|From Kashmiri shawls to Kerala saris and everything in between, the 12-day Saras Development of Women and Children in Rural Areas (DWCRA) Bazaar has something for everyone. Each year since 2014, the exhibition hosts hundreds of merchants and self-help groups (SHG) members to promote their products. This year it has over 360 stalls from 20 States. The fairis organised by the Society for the Elimination of Rural Poverty (SERP), Andhra Pradesh Department of Rural Development. U Jagen Mohan Roa, administrative assistant, SERP, says, “This year we’ve added 60 stalls and a food court. The footfall is around 20,000 to 30,000 people per day. This year we expect to cross over five crores rupees.” The standouts this year are the edibles. There are homemade pickles and snacks. And there is Gulzar Ahmed from Kashmir who will refresh you with his brew. “Yesterday, I sold more than 600 cups of kahwa (Kashmiri tea),” he smiles. M Madhavi a visitor to the fair stocked up on millets that were a bargain, she says. “I purchased millets here at Rs. 100 per kilogram while at supermarkets I would have to spend Rs. 150.” Art and patronage The fair is also an opportunity to watch art being created. Ritu Shyam, 25, head bent paints patiently. She makes them on canvas or handmade paper she explains. She is a Gond artist and a member of Kodi Chitrakala SHG in Patangarh, a village with some 200 odd families. “Almost everyone in our village knows this art. But if the market size shrinks, so will the number of artists.” She says, It takes about a day to make one A3 size painting. In the last 10 days Ritu has sold around a dozen paintings. She says the response to her art has been better in bigger cities. Kids will love the exhibition as there are fun noisy toys such as bird-call whistles to xylophones and mini drums. One such stall is of Nellore’s Udayagiri Wooden Cutlery that also makes colourful wooden toys along with its artistic cutlery. The colours used are made of vegetable dyes so child-friendly. They are made by the 120-member Uttam Mahila Hastha Kala Sirshakuralu in Udayagiri. Wooden combs are also a big draw says Zakir Hussain, who is responsible for market linkages. “Each item is made in sets of 50.” There is a giant wheel that completes the treat for the kids as are cultural dance and song performances by city’s children. But more needs to be done feels Nandini Neemkar from Hyderabad. She sells dupattas and salwars made by Renuka, an SHG from Anjar near Kutch, Gujarat. Majority of the stalls in the fair are set up by middle men. As a result, SHGs fails to get the the full market value on their products. She adds,“Rarely do you find the SHG representatives in such exhibitions. Sometimes I wonder if these events really help the ones who really need it.” VenueAndhra University College of Engineering Grounds DateJanuary 3, 10 am to 10 pm    Going online Now Andhra Pradesh’s SHGs products are sold under one brand called Emahila atkalgudi.com Around 120 SHGs have been added from the State. More additions are in progress. This project is supported by Tata Trusts, SERP and Kaludi.|0|
Bowled over in Mumbai|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|January 03, 2019 00:00 IST|On the surface,Selection Dayis a coming-of-age tale about two teenage brothers and their cricket-obsessed father. But dig deeper and Netflix’s original series, based on Aravind Adiga’s 2016 novel of the same name, throws open various facets of identity – class, religion and sexuality – all tied together in Mumbai, a melting pot of a city. While interviewing the five male actors at a suburban Mumbai hotel, one thing is apparent. Mohammad Samad, Yash Dholye, Karanvir Malhotra, Shiv Pandit and Mahesh Manjrekar come from diverse backgrounds – be it their experience as actors (or non-actors) or their relationship with Mumbai. Naturally, the perspectives they bring to the show are fairly distinct, and so are their takeaways from Adiga's story. City of dreams There’s 18-year-old Samad, playing Manju Kumar, a 14-year-old boy struggling under the dictate of a controlling father. Hailing from Roorkee and currently studying in class 12th, Samad, who was last seen inTumbbad,hopes to enroll himself in a college in Mumbai and pursue acting on the sidelines. Originally from Delhi, 23-year-old Malhotra plays Javed Ansari, an upper-class South Mumbai brat, who shares an unlikely bond with Manju. Essaying the role of Radha Kumar, Manju’s older brother, Dholye had a lot to unlearn about the city – having spent all his life here – to play an outsider in the series. Pandit, who plays a mythical character, Lord Subramanyam, came to Mumbai to become a radio jockey but later acted in films likeShaitan(2011) andLoev(2017). Lastly, Manjrekar, who plays a friendly cricket coach inSelection Day, has spent two decades as an actor and director in the Hindi and Marathi film industries. “Mumbai is a hard nut to crack,” declares Manjrekar, sitting in a hotel room, overlooking the Arabian sea.Selection Daychronicles the journey of a father who brings his two teenage boys to the city with hopes of climbing the socio-economic ladder through cricket. But the realisation that opportunities are unequal and influenced by privilege soon dawns on them. “Where you come from plays such a crucial role in this city, where everything is so extreme,” observes Malhotra. For Pandit, the series is a commentary on the class divide in India, not Mumbai alone. “Opportunities are more in metros [but the series shows] how affluence assists you in being able to get that opportunity,” he says. The mere mention of unequal distribution of wealth in the metropolis instantly riles up Manjrekar. “By choice, I don’t shop at Phoenix Mall,” he claims. “I hope it burns down someday because it is built on so many lives of mill workers. This taking over of the city [by] the upper class is ruining Mumbai.” Discovery and acceptance In addition to class dynamics, there’s a tender track of homosexual self-discovery that Adiga’s novel explores. Interestingly, it’s the friendship between a privileged teen (Javed) and an outsider (Manju) that leads to several realisations – including Manju’s love for science. “A lot of Javed is hidden [also] because of the privileges he comes from,” shares Malhotra, who finds the show’s depiction of self-acceptance the most resonating. Samad nods in agreement. He says that their friendship instils confidence in Manju to pursue his interests beyond cricket, thus defying his tyrannical father and toxic masculinity. There’s similar camaraderie among the actors as well. Manjrekar says he went around backslapping the young actors to build a rapport and make them comfortable on sets. “One or two swear words does the trick,” he laughs, adding that he advises new artistes to refrain from joining acting schools. “They are already here after passing an audition,” reasons the 60-year-old actor. Samad recalls being corrected by Manjrekar for swallowing the last words of his dialogues. “He asked me to keep a pencil in my mouth and practice,” smiles Samad. Abundant universe While a novel can dive deep into the thoughts of a 14-year-old protagonist through exposition,Selection Dayintroduces a new character, Lord Subramanyam (or Lord S.), who is a physical manifestation of Manju’s inner thoughts and conflicts. “When an individual is lost at sea like Manju, they start reaching out for help. At a time like this, we end up thinking a bit extra within ourselves,” says Pandit. “So Lord S. is a visual representation of his inner self.” The actor, who grew up in a religious household, has a spiritual answer to give when asked about his takeaway fromSelection Day. “What really resonates with me is that the universe is abundant, and if you have faith, miracles will happen,” he says, hoping that the show also connects with the audience at a much deeper level.

Cold wave grips Agency mandals|VISAKHAPATNAM|January 04, 2019 00:00 IST|Though the drop in temperature levels to a single digit pushes up the tourist footfall in the Agency of Visakhapatnam district, it proves to be a bane for the tribal people and they prefer to stay indoors due to the biting cold. Eight of 10 mandals in the Agency area have been the worst hit due to the dipping mercury levels for the past one week. Regional Agriculture Research Centre (RARS) at Chintapalli recorded 1.5 degree Celsius, the lowest so far in the last few years, on December 31. In the last couple of days, the temperatures vary between 2.5 and 3.2 degree Celsius. Araku region is also registering temperature less than 10 degree Celsius. According to locals, the impact of the cold weather is more on children and senior citizens who develop health complications. People are seen gather around fire till 10 a.m. to warm up and beat the cold, while shops are being closed by 7.30 p.m. . Locals say they find it difficult to bring drinking water as they have to trek long to get the same. “With thick fog enveloping around, we fear to go out early in the morning. We are going once in three days,” said a tribal, P. Yasoda from Tajangi village in Chintapalli mandal. Health complications Many children, especially the school-going ones, develop health complications. It is learnt that students of almost all tribal welfare schools are forced to take bath with cold water. “Many school children suffer from cold and cough. For the last two days, I have stopped sending my son to school,” said K. Sekhar, a resident of GK Veedhi. Meanwhile, due to thick fog, transportation in the Agency belt has been hit. However, RTC buses are being operated taking the necessary precautions. According to District Collector Pravin Kumar, the Health Department is on alert and continuously monitoring the situation in the Agency. Mr. Pravin Kumar has, however, said no decision has been taken on school timings in the Agency.|0|

China’s probe lands on far side of moon|Beijing|January 04, 2019 00:00 IST|A Chinese space probe touched down on the far side of the moon on Thursday, China’s space agency said, hailing the event as a historic first and a major achievement for the country’s space programme. The Chang’e-4 lunar probe, launched in December, made the “soft landing” at 02.26 GMT and transmitted the first-ever “close range” image of the far side of the moon, the China National Space Administration said. The moon is tidally locked to Earth, rotating at the same rate as it orbits our planet, so most of the far side — or “dark side” — is never visible to us. Previous spacecraft have seen the far side, but none has landed on it. The landing “lifted the mysterious veil” of the far side of the moon and “opened a new chapter in human lunar exploration,” the agency said in a statement on its website, which included a wide-angle colour picture of a crater from the moon’s surface. The probe touched down at a targeted area near the moon’s south pole in the Von Karman Crater, after entering its orbit in mid-December. The tasks of the Chang’e-4 include astronomical observation, surveying the moon’s terrain, land form and mineral make-up, and measuring the neutron radiation and neutral atoms to study the environment of its far side. “It’s an important milestone for China’s space exploration,” Wu Weiren, chief designer of the lunar exploration programme, said.|0|

Sikri said, even as the Supreme Court expressed its dissatisfaction with the ongoing operations to rescue men from the flooded rat-hole mine in Meghalaya. A Bench of Justices A.K. Sikri and S. Abdul Nazeer said the rescue efforts seemed uncoordinated and yielding no results. The court asked the Centre what it had done so far. “You had wanted to send high-powered pumps to Thailand [to rescue Thai boys and their teacher trapped in a cave there]... Why have you not done it here? Why?” Justice Sikri asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, for the Centre. Mr. Mehta responded that the Central Coal Minister, along with the Meghalaya Chief Minister and senior officials, was monitoring the rescue, and would appoint a nodal officer exclusively for the effort.

China lands probe on far side of moon|Beijing|January 04, 2019 00:00 IST|A Chinese space probe touched down on the far side of the moon on Thursday, China’s space agency said, hailing the event as a historic first and a major achievement for the country’s space programme. The Chang’e-4 lunar probe, launched in December, made the “soft landing” at 02.26 GMT and transmitted the first-ever “close range” image of the far side of the moon, the China National Space Administration said. Tidally locked The moon is tidally locked to Earth, rotating at the same rate as it orbits our planet, so most of the far side — or “dark side” — is never visible to us. Previous spacecraft have seen the far side, but none has landed on it. The landing “lifted the mysterious veil” of the far side of the moon and “opened a new chapter in human lunar exploration,” the agency said in a statement on its website, which included a wide-angle colour picture of a crater from the moon’s surface. The probe, which has a lander and a rover, touched down at a targeted area near the moon’s south pole in the Von Karman Crater, after entering its orbit in mid-December. The tasks of the Chang’e-4 include astronomical observation, surveying the moon’s terrain, land form and mineral make-up, and measuring the neutron radiation and neutral atoms to study the environment of its far side.|0|
